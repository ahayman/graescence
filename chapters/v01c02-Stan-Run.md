Light folded itself into a crystal bowl. Of course, the bowl was made neither of crystal nor light, but graescent forces locked into a stable resonance. Those forces bent the light and reflected it rather like glass, or crystal, thus earning its name.

"I knew a shaper once," Min Li said as she dipped her feet into the water of a stream they'd found. "She was quite accomplished for her age. In her thirties, I think."

He sent the bowl down and brought up water. He dumped it over his feet all at once. Runnels of mud dripped down the stone he sat on, but not nearly enough to reveal actual feet beneath the muck caked to them.

"She'd learned three shapes in less than fifteen years. They named her a prodigy and called her a national asset."

The bowl expanded and then elongated on one side to form a spout. He sent it back down into the water and brought up considerably more water. He carefully poured it over a foot, wriggling his toes while rubbing his feet of the mud.

"She explained to me how difficult it was to shape. It took her years learning how to control her graescence well enough to form it into even the most basic shape. A single edge of light-blue glass, sharp enough to cut most anything."

He sent the bowl for water a third time and cleansed his other foot.

"I asked her if she could do more than one at a time. She laughed at me and said such things were all but impossible. She likened it to solving multiple advanced equations in your head all at once."

Stan blinked as a thought occurred to him. The rain had stopped over an hour ago, leaving a pleasant scattering of clouds and sun dappling the forest. He glanced up at the crystal umbrella he'd forgotten was there. It dissolved, seeming to fray at the edges first, and then unravel into strips that floated for a brief moment before disappearing in a riot of refracted color.

Crystal was quite beautiful when it unravelled in the light.

"You done?" He turned to her.

"Hmm." She pulled her feet from the stream and shook off the water.

"Good. We should go. The Inquisitors won't be far behind."

He split in half the crystal box holding his acquired shoes and sent the smaller pair of shoes to rest on the stone next to her. The box dissolved, and she took the shoes.

"They're probably too big," he said, "but better than nothing."

He shoved his feet into the larger pair and then stomped around a little to get used to them. After he was satisfied he wouldn't get too many blisters, he gestured at her to come over.

"This part'll be tricky."

She jumped up to the larger boulder he was standing on and gave him a dubious look. Crystal formed from the top of the stone and stretched until it met another boulder a short ways up stream. A bridge, and not a simple pane of crystal either. He'd arced the surface and formed a complex network of support structures underneath it.

Min Li screwed up her face. "We're _walking_ on it?"

"Not like that we aren't. Hold on."

He focused on the feeling of the crystal, like a smooth texture in his mind, and willed a very specific kind of dissonance into it. The crystal shimmered orange.

"Citrine glass?" Min Li asked, perplexed. "I wasn't aware such a thing existed."

"Citrine? Huh, I like it." He stepped on the bridge and quickly walked to the other side.

She knelt and placed a hand flat on the glass. "It tingles."

"Yes, from the dissonance. Creates friction so we don't slide all over the place. Are you coming? I'd rather not repeat our encounter with our friends in black."

She stood and followed reluctantly, stepping lightly and eyeing the water as though she expected to be dumped into it at any moment.

He let the bridge dissolve and immediately formed another mildly arcing to a set of rocks he judged sturdy enough. In this way, they walked up river, bridging between boulder and rocks or downed trees, anything he could anchor to that wouldn't give away their presence. After some time, he found a perfect tree for the next stage of their journey.

"No, absolutely not." Min Li stared at a staircase of citrine glass leading away from the stream and up to a low hung tree branch.

"I've found trackers don't tend to look up much."

He climbed the staircase and gestured for her to follow.

"There has to be a better way," she said, shaking her head.

"Come or don't, but I'm not waiting around."

She bit her lip, looking deeply conflicted. She stepped tentative on the staircase. Then another and another, slowly growing her confidence. She placed a hand on the tree trunk and let out a slow breath he only now realized she'd been holding the entire ascent.

He formed a new set of stairs to another tree and walked up it, allowing the first staircase to dissolve. Min Li, stranded with only one direction to go, followed reluctantly. She kept glancing at the brush below her, which irritated him to no end. He wasn't going to drop her, dammit.

Once they were high enough, he formed simple bridges, allowing them to walk high above a thick undergrowth. Despite the effort of forming so much crystal, he found his shoulders relaxing the further they walked from their pursuers.

Min Li was not relaxed, at all. She walked carefully, uncertain, her eyes darting between the trees and him. He knew what she was thinking. Just one lapse of concentration, just one little mistake in the advanced calculus required to form such shapes, and he would dump both of them over fifty paces into the thick underbrush below.

"Was she happy?" Stan asked, his pace leisurely now that they'd gained some distance. "Your shaper friend?"

Min Li startled. "I...I would imagine so, though we were never friends."

"Why?"

"...why what?"

"Why do you think she was happy?"

Min Li snorted. "Money? Respect? She's probably one of the highest paid people in the province."

"So money is what it takes to be happy?"

"No, of course not." She frowned. "It does help though."

"What did she do?"

"Guarded the Matron."

"Ah, a guard." He couldn't quite keep the distaste from his tone.

"It's an honored position," Min Li bristled, "that raised her whole family."

"Of course it did."

She huffed, looking as though she wanted to argue. She closed her mouth instead, glancing nervously at the bridge of citrine they stood on.

"I'm not going to drop you, dammit," he growled, picking up his pace. "Come on."

They walked an hour before Stan began to feel the strain of making so much glass. Crystal was easier for him, a small bit of irony that to create imperfection required so much more work, the exact opposite of every other shaper in existence. He had no doubt Min Li spoke truth about her shaper friend, who'd devoted her life to approaching a perfection he couldn't help but create naturally.

Min Li visibly relaxed when her feet touched the ground. He scowled at her. They'd literally been walking among the tree tops, a thing he'd once thought would be a great way to woo a woman. Instead, he got Min Li.

"Why are you even here?"

"Which way now?" she asked, ignoring his question as she looked around the small glade they'd stepped into.

Several paths led deeper into the forest. Stan seemed to consider them for a few moments, then chose one at random. The path was more of a suggestion of the imagination than any real trail. He formed crystal walls to carefully press back the foliage, while trying to avoid breaking it. It would have been far easier to cut a path, but he was still wary about leaving a trail.

They walked until, apparently, Min Li couldn't take it anymore.

"_Where_ are we going?" she asked in an accusatory tone he was beginning to hate.

He paused, then point down the not-trail. "That way."

"No," she huffed, "I mean what's our destination. I cannot think of a single city, town, or village in this direction."

"This way," he replied without pausing.

She growled something incomprehensible under her breath and stomped after him. Another hour passed trudging through the undergrowth before they reach another glade. This one was long with trees lined up on either side, hinting at something like order or design that wasn't actually there.

They followed it for a while before Stan abruptly veered off to push through undergrowth again. It took a few seconds to realize Min Li was no longer following him.

He turned around and found her still standing in the glade, looking at him with an incredulous expression.

"You're lost," she accused him.

"Yep." He blinked, then turned and continued to press through the forest.

"No no no no no." She rushed to him and grabbed his arm, spinning him about. "_No!_ Why...why would you get us lost? In a forest of all places? Where are we going to sleep?"

He glanced at a sun who's color had just begun to deepen into evening.

"The ground, probably."

Her face fell. "Noooo..."

He began walking again, leaving her to wallow in distress. He'd only taken a few steps before she caught up to him again.

"But why? Why would you do this?" 'To me,' seemed to be the implication.

He shrugged. "Cause they won't expect it. Or, even if they do, it's really hard to find a person lost in a forest."

"No, that's not...no, just no. We need to find a village or a town or _something_."

"And you don't think they'll anticipate that?"

"So we be careful."

"There is no careful, Min Li. It's not just two people we have to avoid. Or four, I guess, with whoever's after you. It's their entire network. And let me tell you, Inquisitors have a very, very thorough network."

"But—"

"The _only_ thing we can do is avoid their network," he gestured around, "until we can go where they aren't looking."

"...where is that?"

"Far, like weeks far."

Min Li pressed her face into her hands and moaned.

"How are we going to eat?" she asked through her fingers.

"Oh, there's plenty to eat in a forest."

"No—"

"You say that a lot."

"—I cannot eat only meat for weeks on end."

"...sorry?" His brow creased. "I don't know what you want from me, Min Li. I have Inquisitors after me, _Inquisitors_."

"You seemed to handle them easily enough. I've never heard of anyone incapacitating Inquisitors quite so quickly as you."

"And then what? I can handle two, sure. Four? Probably. But six, eight, _ten_? I don't want to escalate things, Min. I want them to leave me alone."

He spun on heel and stomped into brush, crystal pushing it back as he progressed.

"Li," she spoke quietly to his back. "My name is Min _Li_."

He continued for only a few minutes before stopping again and turning back to her, fuming.

"Why are you following me, anyway? You clearly know where the nearest village is or whatever. Go there and sleep in a bed and eat...not meat, or whatever. And you know what, _here_."

He reached over to the money folds he'd secured with a small strip of crystal, crystal that had been floating so close to his hip she hadn't realized it wasn't attached.

He thrust the money at her.

She glanced at it contemptuously. "Oh yes, I'm sure you'd love that. I'd make a perfect decoy for the Inquisitors to follow."

"That's not what I—"

"Why are they after you, Stan Li? I get that you're gifted—"

"Don't call me that," he growled.

She rolled her eyes. "Inquisitors don't go after the gifted, Stan _Li_, they go after..." Her faced paled.

His face blanched as a deadly silence was born between them.

"I am not one of them," he said in a thin tone filled with too much fear and pain. She did not find it convincing.

He turned from her and pushed through brush again, his body leaning forward in effort as the crystal pressed back the vegetation that would normally make passage all but impossible. More impressive, he wasn't forming solid walls of crystal. They undulated around the foliage, pressing each branch back individually just enough that they wouldn't break.

He wasn't perfect, and occasionally branches did break. Yet the display demonstrated a proficiency that was all but impossible. Min Li knew there were gifted that could modify the shape of their glass, but it took decades of practice to manage the simplest changes and, generally, the practice was considered academic and impractical. Better to learn well simple shapes that could be called into existence easily.

Of course, shapers only ever made glass too, and Stan created crystal, a feat most considered theoretical.

"Were you tested?" she asked after a few minutes.

His body tensed, but he didn't stop. "I've never destroyed a town, or a village, or even a building," he said defensively. "I've never blown up or anything like what they say godlings do."

"Yeah," she said slowly, "but were you tested?"

He said nothing, which was answer enough. She matched his silence. He could feel her uncertainty, her suspicion, her accusation in the words she didn't speak. He was a walking bomb and anything could set him off. At any moment he could destroy everything because that's what godlings did and that's why Inquisitors hunted them.

He didn't even blame them for it. He couldn't. Godlings were a blight. They needed to be hunted down and destroyed before they could threaten all of society.

He just...didn't want to die. He was scared, and the shame ate him from the inside out, a slow burning cancer that destroyed every home he tried to make.

The sun dipped into the horizon, hidden beyond their sight yet tainting the sky's blues with colors his citrine bridges could disappear into. He stopped at a small clearing, barely even a glade at less than ten paces in size.

Min Li watched expressionless as he put on a display that would make the most accomplished shapers green with envy, all to collect sticks into piles. It took her too long to realize what he intended.

"Won't the smoke give us away?"

"Not if there's no smoke."

Her face turned perplexed as he formed a tall, narrow cylinder of crystal with vents along the bottom. He packed it vertically with the smallest of the sticks he'd gathered. He formed a sliver of crystal above, took a deep breath, and drove the dissonance into gold.

Her brow pinched. "Yellow glass now!?"

"Don't touch it," he replied in a strained voice. "It's very abrasive."

He thrust the glass into sticks. After a few seconds, a thin line of smoke threaded its way out of the pile. He maintained the yellow even as sweat began to bead on his forehead. Finally, he saw the flicker of a flame. He let the sliver of glass dissolve, which it did quite readily.

"I don't understand. How can glass make fire?"

"Friction," he replied with a sigh, wiping his brow, "a whole lot of friction."

She cocked her head at him. "And that was hard?"

He nodded. "Yellow's not stable. Takes a lot to keep it formed."

"But crystal, the same crystal everyone says is impossible to make, _that's_ easy?"

He snorted. "Very. It's stable. Once it's formed, it takes almost nothing to keep it there."

She blinked slowly at him. "That's not how it's supposed to work."

He shrugged, then sat down in the dirt to watch the flames grow. He kept careful eye on the smoke, ready to close off the crystal if his fire did produce too much smoke. So far, the forest canopy dispersed the little smoke drifting through the leaves.

"I've never talked to another shaper before, but I think...I think it does work that way. I'm just coming at it from the other direction."

She sat down next to him. "What do you mean?"

He turned a hand over and formed a crystal ball above it.

"This? This took nothing to make. No no, I mean it," he said, laughing at her expression, "feeding a light takes way more graescence than forming this. The graescence this takes is so little I can't feel it leaving me at all."

He concentrated a moment and the crystal turned into a light green glass.

"This is...well, I can feel it, but it's more like holding a marble in your hand. You know the weight is there, but you can ignore it."

He took a breath and focused again, turning the light green glass into a light blue.

"This is hard, like holding a large dog with one hand. I can do it, but it's a lot of effort."

He let the glass dissolve.

"And violet?" she asked.

He shook his head. "I can't really make violet. It's just too much. My shapes sometimes turn violet if I send them out of my range, but they dissolve quickly. I can't support them; they take too much graescence."

Min Li fell silent, her brow furrowed in thought. The fire had grown large enough that Stan felt comfortable adding to it. He expanded the cylinder, allowing the half-burnt twigs to drop to the bottom. He then inserted new, larger twigs to the mix. It was a careful balance. Too big and the fire would burn dirty. Too small and it would burn too quickly. He carefully watched the smoke, making sure it wouldn't plume above the forest canopy.

"You realize this changes everything? If we could just teach people how to form crystal first..."

"We could what?" He turned to her. "Kill our enemies better? Easier? We could invade other provinces with impunity, maybe? Frozen hells, perhaps we could even challenge the Empire!"

"That's not what I mean."

"I know. But you can't deny it's what would happen."

She didn't deny it. She stared at the fire instead, watching it grow. Stan's construct was fascinating. The crystal made the fire look as though it were floating in air, which was halfway true. But she also watched a dried leaf flutter by one of the vents as it pulled in air to feed the fire.

Such innovation from pure imagination, formed into reality with no effort at all.

What _would_ people do with that kind of power?

"I don't want to be a weapon," he said finally in a small voice. "I just want to..."

Make art. He wanted to dance and flip through the air, becoming a thing of beauty to enlighten others. And yes, he _wanted_ to use his gift; he wanted to use it to show the world a different way, a better way. Yet he couldn't put the idea into words. He _wouldn't_.

"You're delusional," she said as a matter of fact.

He hated her for those words, but he nodded anyway. Some dreams were too fragile to speak out loud.
