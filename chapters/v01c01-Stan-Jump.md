Stanley Chao stood on the edge of a flimsy wooden board over a hundred paces above the ground. Far below, patches of dirt and worn grass were revealed as featureless browns and greens from dizzying spotlights that roamed the earth below.

A man stood center among three fixed spotlights, himself a red blur under the intense light. He gestured gregariously, sweeping his arm in a wide circle before raising it to point at Stan. Several spotlights followed, blinding Stan from seeing anything else. The man bellowed something but his words were drowned out by the roar of a crowd.

Stan tied a blindfold over his eyes with slow, exaggerated motions. He raised his arms and edged forward until half his feet dangled over nothing. Before him rested a swing, its rope swaying lightly.

Silence descended as though on cue.

The swing dropped.

Stan tilted forward and let gravity take him. It took no effort at all to court death, just a small shift in weight.

A collective gasp from the crowed touched his ears before the wind tore it away. Below him, the swing gained too much momentum. It curved away from him as death's irony, the plummeting man chasing the swing only a finger out of reach.

Stanley Chao was a dead man. He knew it; the man on the ground knew it; the crowd knew it. With nothing but air between him and an abrupt rendezvous with death, his only hope sped away in a parabolic arc.

He began to flail in the air like one who'd never jumped before, his fingers grasping nothing but air.

Such a simple mistake to make, barely a split second off timing.

On a stand that mirrored his stood a woman, a true beauty wearing a tight dress of patterned red tailored to draw the eye. Yet where there should have been supreme grace and unflappable confidence, she wore a hand on her mouth and horror in her eyes. She belatedly threw her own swing down, presumably in an attempt to save the doomed man.

Didn't matter. Not really. Any fool could see her swing wouldn't make it in time. Several in the audience had stood as though to stop fate itself, yet there was nothing to do but revel in the horror of a stunt gone terribly wrong.

They'd paid to see something fantastic, after all. The poster guaranteed it, or your money back.

In a fluid motion, the beauty ripped off her dress, revealing a striped leotard that matched Stan's. She leapt without a pebble of hesitation. Half the audience tore their eyes off the plummeting man to watch a new tragedy unfold.

Despite the obvious disaster, the beauty couldn't keep a small smile from her face as she flew through the air.

Stan suddenly stopped flailing, and then...physics stopped making sense. The woman's swing turned glossy, reflecting more light than it should. Most didn't notice, eyes glued to either grace or tragedy. Then the woman's swing suddenly _sped up_.

A trick of the light, or a trick of the mind. Most couldn't understand what had happened. She'd jumped after him, and they would _swear_ the swing couldn't possibly make it in time. And yet, somehow, Stanley Chao grasped the woman's swing at precisely the same moment her fingers alighted on his.

The crowd watch in stunned silence as the flailing man transformed into an acrobat mirroring the woman's grace. They crossed at the apex of their swing before using the momentum to double flip up onto their counterpart's platforms.

With a dramatic flourish, Stan ripped off his blindfold and bowed.

The crowd jumped up in a roar of cheers and applause in a sound would never grow old. Never. He nodded to his counterpart, and they both stepped off their platforms to begin a complicated dance of flips and tricks, all done to the roar of an approving crowd.

Not all thundered applause, though. Two men dressed in sharply tailored suits of black and gray had watched the affair with detached interest. They had not gasped at the falling man, nor applauded the stunt's finale. They had not watched Stan at all, nor even the women.

They had watched the swing.

As Stan and his counterpart swung flips through the air, the pair stood and began to make their way down the stands, unhurried and unconcerned, their steps as inevitable as fate itself.

"Incredible!" Chi Wan clasped Stan's shoulder, squeezing. "You and Min blew it away. I swear even I thought you'd courted death's embrace."

Stanley smiled polite and returned to the younger man a small nod.

"You flatter me," Stan said with an undercurrent of, 'please stop talking'.

He continued walking through a narrow hallway made of waxed canvas, the younger man only a half a step behind. The patter of rain filled the brief silence as the both of them picked their way around puddles seeping in from under the folds.

"You know I don't. There's a performance, and then there's you two. You? You're...ah, I could only wish to be as good as you."

"Time and practice," Stan lied, "time and practice."

Oh, Stan had no doubt Chi would eventually become a great performer, but there was no substituting for Stan's gift.

"But it's more than that—oh I know, I know. You practice just as much—no, _more_ than any of us. But you? You've got a trick, or something. I couldn't do that, just...fall like you did. That..." The boy shook his head. "That's something else."

Stan frowned at the boy's words but kept walking. They arrived in a spacious tent filled with a riot of color and sound where upcoming performers stretched, practiced, or simply relaxed. They passed strange animals with their trainers enticing treats for tricks, performers twisted into convoluted shapes, clowns on stilts, and ever increasing oddities.

He stopped at a pair of dancers, their motions syncopated and complex as they counterbalanced in twirls, revolving and flowing in a way that tempted one to think they must be dancing on air. Lead and follow became blurred as they traded off guiding one another on cues only they knew, their steps intricate, intimate.

A hint of longing tainted Stan's face as one woman closed her eyes, face serene and content, fully trusting her lifelong partner.

"You miss the point," he said distantly. "The trick is just that, a trick. It is important to grab the attention, but that is all. This," he nodded to the couple, "is true art."

He turned fully to the boy. "Do not pursue the trick. Pursue the art."

"Yes, yes, of course, I understand. I will—I _do_ pursue it every day."

He did not. The boy practiced, certainly, but his eyes were still clouded by the glamour of too many spotlights.

"Before you pursue anything, though, I believe Mrs. Chen will have your hide if you're late to the walks?"

"The wha—oh!" The boy's eyes widened comically. He spun to leave then jerked back to Stan. "Oh uh, thank you!" He half bowed, turning it into a twisting motion as he tried to turn and run all at the same time.

Stan watched the boy rush back with a small smile. The smile fell off when he turned back toward the couple. He watched them for a few seconds more before it became too much. He turned from his regret and continued his way toward the back of the tent.

"Min Li," he said as he sat down on a stool in front of a mirror ringed by inert lights. He reached over and fed a small panel his graescence until the lights brightened enough to highlight his face. He began checking over his makeup.

"Stan-_li_," she replied belatedly, using a more traditional pronunciation of his name instead of the one his parent's had given him.

"You did well," he said, trying to infuse genuine warmth into his tone, yet his uncertainty tainted his attempt. He never could figure her out.

"Of course," she replied, giving him a false smile, "and you did..."

She cocked her head, then turned back to touch up her own makeup.

On stage, they were synced in a way few could attain. He could never understand why she hated him for it.

He stripped off his leotard, leaving him clad only in tight underwear. She mirrored him with the same practiced movements. A few moments later, they'd pulled on a different set of tights covering most of their body without adding any modesty whatsoever. Modesty was a long running joke in a troupe like this.

Their next performance was his favorite, a dance in the air among silks. Designed to blend in with the streamers, their costumes would serve to obscure their movements without detracting from the grace of the dance.

It was one of the few performances that required no tricks of him. Just beauty; just art.

He glanced at his unwilling partner looking for a connection, but she was staring at the mirror with a blank expression.

A commotion behind them drew their attention. Min Li spun on her stool, then jerked as though struck. A small gasp escaped her lips, her eyes gone wide in horror stained panic. It was, quite literally, the most emotion he'd ever seen her display.

He slid off his stool and with a couple steps stood beside her. A pair of men walked towards them, eyes locked on Min Li. Though they were still a ways away, he could see that they were extremely well dressed, _dangerously_ well dressed, the kind of dress Stan had learned to avoid. Dark red and green silks wrapped their upper bodies, flaring into loose fitting pants that flowed around their steps. From their back fell a thick gray cloak, hoods pulled back and still shedding beads of rain.

But why a pair of Royals would degrade themselves to walk among a lowly troupe like this, he had no idea.

He turned back to Min Li and the question died on his lips. His eyes focused beyond onto yet another pair walking toward them, _their_ eyes locked on him. His stomach churned acid at the sight of them, a man and women, both dressed in a perfectly tailored black suit covering gray silk beneath it. The way the black cloth seemed to shimmer beneath the light was unmistakable, as was the antiquated cut of long split-tails that wrapped their legs.

Inquisitors.

There was only one rational thing to do when a pair of Inquisitors had you in their sights.

"Run," he whispered.

Min Li started at the sound, then followed Stan's gaze toward the Inquisitors.

"What? Impossible. Why would they..."

She slowly turned to Stan, giving him a questioning look. He turned sheepish, and her expression turned deeply incredulous, which was...fair. Inquisitors generally only addressed issues that threatened the stability of the Empire and, by extension, the world itself.

"Min Li," he gave her a small bow, "it has been a...well, something, but I'm afraid this is where we must part."

He turned to run.

"Oh, no you don't." She grasped his forearm with startling strength.

"I am...um." His eyes jumped between between her and the Inquisitors as confusion mixed with a rising panic. "I don't think you quite understand the—"

"I understand enough. You will take me with you."

"_What?_" Only the suicidal would come within striking distance of Inquisitors.

"Was I not clear? I'm coming. Now," she glanced at the pair of Royals approaching, "what is your plan of escape?"

"My plan of _what_!?"

"Your..." her face tightened, "surely you have a plan."

He snorted. "Yeah, sure. I'll just—oh, too late. She's gonna jump."

The female Inquisitor drew a wooden knife from her jacket. Experience had taught him that once they drew their knives, it was usually too late to run.

The woman disappeared within a shimmering distortion. A loud crack filled the tent, drawing every eye to them and causing Min Li to gasp.

The woman had appeared behind him, her knife shimmering with green glass wrapped about it. Yet her strike, aimed precisely at the back of his neck, struck a crystal dome that had folded around both Stan and Min Li. The knife shattered, filling the tent with the sound and infecting the crystal with a green tint radiating outward from the impact.

Stan purged the green from his crystal, stabilizing it back into a clear, almost invisible dome. He turned to face his attacker. The Inquisitor gave Stan a dry smile, then pressed her shoulder into the dome. Green once again infected the crystal, radiating outward from the woman's shoulder and deepening in saturation far too quickly for his comfort.

It was not possible to overstate just how much he hated those jackets.

"You're a shaper?" Min Li asked in a confused tone.

"Not the time," he replied through gritted teeth.

The other Inquisitor arrived to press in from the other side. The entire dome glimmered green except for where their shoulders pressed into blue as the integrity deteriorated further.

"Dammit." He had only seconds before his surface collapsed.

So he collapsed it himself. The Inquisitors stumbled forward as the dome unravelled into strips of dissolving glass, right into two smaller spheres he thrust out just above eye level.

Their heads snapped back, and both Inquisitors collapsed, unconscious.

"Did you just—"

"They're still alive," Stan said, annoyed, then mumbled under his breath, "this time...I think."

Not that he intended to hang around and find out.

Min Li narrowed her eyes at him, which he studiously ignored. Over a dozen wide-eyed performers stared at him with expressions ranging from awe to outright horror. The pair of Royals had paused, looking uncertain between him and Min Li.

He turned to her. "I believe this is my cue for a timely—"

"I'm coming."

"Are you insane?" he almost shouted. "Inquisitors don't stop, ever."

"I'm coming," she repeated, then glanced at the Royals. "Better than the alternative."

"...alright, fine, crazy woman. Follow me."

He stomped his way toward the back of the tent without checking to see if she would follow. Blades of crystal formed before him. He sent them out to slice open a hole large enough for them to walk through. As the blades dissolved, a half dome of crystal folded over their heads. Rain pattered lightly on it.

His secret was out now; might as well be dry. Or most of him, anyway. Mud had already pressed in between his toes unpleasantly.

Forsaken gods but he could have used a little warning, if only to don a proper pair of boots.

They made it about a dozen paces before a shout behind them pierced the rain.

"Min Li Ch—"

"_No!_" she shouted as she spun, "I will not go back. You tell him I will _never_ go back."

"And he will never stop, Min Li," the man replied in a tired voice. "You know this."

"I will never go back," she repeated, threading her arm through Stan's and drawing him close.

"Uh...?"

The man sneered at her, or him. It was hard to tell.

"Deal with them," she said in a flat tone.

"Deal? I am not your personal—"

"Just do it, or do you want them showing your Inquisitor friends exactly where we've gone?"

Stan rolled his eyes, but still formed a pair of crystal spheres, virtually invisible in the rain. They shot out toward the pair of Royals, glinting green then blue as they passed beyond his range and began to deteriorate.

The Royals saw it coming and tried to dodge, but it was far too late. Even as deteriorated glass, both balls struck hard enough that the sound made Stan flinch.

"Gotta figure out a better way to do that," he half mumbled to himself, hoping that crack he'd heard wasn't their skulls actually breaking.

Min Li quickly untangled her arm and levelled at him a strange look, like someone trying to figure a particularly difficult puzzle. Or maybe a cat trying to figure out how to pounce on a tasty morsel that just happened to have legs.

With that thought, he stared at the man's legs. Or rather, his feet.

"Where are you going?"

But Stan was already jogging toward the pair of men he'd just knocked unconscious. He knelt, first checking to make sure they were still alive, then...robbing them. Not everything of course—this wasn't about greed—and he didn't leave them naked or anything so crude. But both would wake up a just a little lighter, missing their cloak, money clip, and boots.

When he turned back, all his newly acquired contraband placed in a crystal box floating chest level, he found Min Li glaring at him a flat expression that promised murder.

"...oh."

He immediately formed a new umbrella of blue glass over her head, but the damage was done. Her hair had plastered to hear head and face, and her leotard had turned a full shade darker. Rain water dripped from her nose.

"If you're done pilfering the defenseless, perhaps we should leave before the Inquisitors wake up?"

Blue glass shifted to greens, lightening until it was as crystal clear as he approached. He dissolved it and expanded his personal umbrella over the both of them.

"Please tell me you have some sort of plan," Min Li asked.

He pulled out a cloak and handed it to her. She took it, but hesitated, something like disgust flashing across her face. Practicality won out and she donned the cloak.

"For Inquisitors?" He shook his head. "There is ever only one plan for them."

He threw the second cloak over his shoulders and trudged barefoot toward the tree line against which the troupe had set up. Hidden within the canopy shadows, he turned back to stare at yet another home lost.

Flashes of movement could be seen through the hole he'd carved in the tent, but nothing of Inquisitors yet. It wouldn't be long; they'd wasted too much time.

But this time it was 'they', and not him alone.

He wasn't sure how to feel about that.
