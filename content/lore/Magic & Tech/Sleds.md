A Sled has two (or more, but usually only two) strips of Elderin core filaments (usually called runners) that run parallel to each other. The graescent fields generated will "press" against latent graescence below it, causing the sled to "float" in the air about a pace. Because something floating in the air has virtually no friction, the ends of the runner are curved up, causing them to press outward and provide a modicum of friction.

<-- excerpt -->

For a Sled to function, it must be placed above something with stable, latent graescence. This is most things with some notable exceptions:

- Water has latent graescence but is not stable (constantly fluctuating with the movement of the water). Technically, if the water was perfectly still, it would work, though that's almost impossible to find out of extremely controlled situations. Ice works, though.
- Pure crystal (like quartz) contains very little latent graescence. A sled will struggle to work properly over ground that contains a high enough concentration of crystal in the substrates below.
- Glass contains no latent graescence. So if you happen to see a glass bridge, maybe don't try to take a sled across it.

While Sleds can and are operated by people (Royals are fond of them for Palanquins), they are most commonly paired with Drajin, a very large lizard uniquely suited to powering Sleds. While Drajin are slow compared to other animals like a horse, they can power a sled for leagues without tiring. As such, they are the most common form of transportation for goods. Drajin merchant trains commonly criss cross the Empire.

The amount of graescence required to lift a Sled increases exponentially with the height, with a sweet spot around a pace off the ground. For this reason, Sleds cannot be used for flight. However, the "ground" can affect this quite a bit. The more structured the latent graescence below, the easier it is to float the Sled. Structural Elderin, for instance, is very easy to float a Sled above. It would make for a fantastic road if it weren't absurdly expensive to create such a thing.
