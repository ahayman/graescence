The principle currency of the Rotakan Empire. The Rocsillian takes the form of a small rectangular piece of cloth-like paper about three fingers wide and five fingers long. While other currencies do exist, the Empire actively discourages their use to the point of violence if they believe another currency might threaten the Rocsillian. As such, the Rocsillian is by far the common currency of the world, with others taking only niche applications. 

<-- excerpt -->

The Rocsillian is a woven currency. Using a proprietary, carefully guarded technique, leaf stems from the Elderin tree are turned into dyed fiber that is then woven into the slips of paper used around the world. While the leaf stems are considered the weakest part of the Elderin tree, they nevertheless are extremely resilient, waterproof, virtually immune to tampering, and easy to identify. A single Rocsillian can last decades before having to be replaced.

As with most currencies, the Roc has earned several nicknames:

- Roc(s): Just a shortening of the official currency name, this is the most common nomenclature.
- Slip(s): Because of their diminutive size, Rocs are often called slips.
- Ridgeback(s): The weaving process creates an almost invisible ridge alongside along the outside edge of the paper that can be felt if you rub your thumb across it. For this reason, they're often called Ridgebacks.  This includes a couple shorternings of the name: ridges and backs. Though it should be noted that both of these shortenings are often mixed with sexual innuendos, and not always in a flattering manner.
- Chit(s): No one really knows where this nickname comes from, though many theorize it was derived from a prior form of currency. The Rocsillian has been in play for thousands of years, though, which makes verifying this very difficult. However, some ancient texts do use the word, supporting the theory.
- Cred(s): The term is a fairly obvious shortening of "Credit". It's almost exclusively used around larger banking centers, where wealthy personages can "exchange" their Rocs for Creds. Creds don't usually exist. It's just a term that means you've entrusted your wealth to a bankâ€” in other words, creds are your Rocs being held by the bank. Of note: occasionally, a bank will issue their own currency (exchange Rocs physical creds). The Empire cracks down hard on that sort of thing to the point where physical creds are more collector items than actual currency.
