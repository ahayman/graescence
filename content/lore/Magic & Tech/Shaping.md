Shaping is a difficult discipline in which a person generates two opposing forces using their graescence, then solidifies them together using a form of resonance between the fields. This creates an invisible "surface" that is often referred to as a "shield", reflecting its most common application. A Shaper can generate these surfaces and manipulate them into "shapes".

<-- excerpt -->

Shaped surfaces can take on virtually any form, theoretically. It is possibly the most difficult discipline to master, and takes most people who try over a decade of study to become barely proficient at it. Those who do master the discipline are highly valuable. 

The most common configuration for a Shaper to master is to create a simple "edge", achieved by folding a shape over on itself. A properly formed edge will cut through virtually anything (except other shapes, possibly, depending on how well formed they are). If the Shaper can move and orient their edge at will, they can easily become the most dangerous combatant on a battle field, killing with little more than a thought.

This is assuming the surface are "solid" enough, which is an important aspect of shaping. An excellent surface is one that feels like a solid object, albeit frictionless. Not only are solid objects stronger, but they take less energy to form, even if learning how to do it is exceedingly difficult.

The most advanced shapers can create complex shapes with their surfaces and even manage multiple at once, though they are often quite elderly by the time they've managed this. It it far more common for a shaper to learn to form a shield and edge and then solidify those as much as possible. This makes them a terror on the battlefield.
