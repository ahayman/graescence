Heating things up with graescence is a rather simple affair, requiring two graescent fields interacting with enough dissonance to heat up the particles within. Two separate coils of Elderin core filament will do it, though there are ways to increase efficiency. The most common way is to split the filaments into spiralled fractals rotating in opposition to one another. The more fractals, the more efficient it will be, and the more costly. High end plates, stove, and ovens will have hundreds of branching, spiralling filaments working together to create heat with as little effort as possible. A low end hotplate, on the other hand, may only have two.

The most common way of creating a heating element is to pour molten iron around the Elderin core filaments, which are set in a cast. This allows the graescence to directly heat up the iron. A more elaborate, artisan approach would be to carve the exact filament pattern into a clear substrate (ex: clear quartz). This is only done for very expensive, high-end pieces. Not only does it display the beauty of the design, but also makes it easy to verify the authenticity of the workmanship. When a design is hidden in iron, it can be quite the temptation to overstate the workmanship for extra money.

That said, keeping a clear quartz stove clean is an exercise in frustration. Most cooks don't like using them for that reason. However many _Royals_ do like them, even if it's only as a status symbol. So cooks who do use them (willing or not) tend to leave the cleaning to someone else "lower" in the social hierarchy. This phenomena has led to the saying, "cooking on quartz", which is used to describe someone who's doing something elaborate and/or unnecessary, while leaving the fallout/cleanup to someone else.
