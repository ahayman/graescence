Anna is the second child and only daughter of Richard Longsun, King of the Santonia province, richest and most powerful of all the provinces of the Rotakan Empire. Known as the "spitfire princess", she's a short temper and fierce fighter. Fiercely independent, she chafes against the requirements of her station, often devoting her time to training.

When not training, she's usually engaged in the normal machinations of the Royals. Yet no matter how independent she wishes to be, she cannot escape the duties thrust upon her...until she does.

<-- excerpt -->

- Called Princess normally, at home, when she's a princess, which is most of the time.
- Goes by Stasia when she's out in the city, hiding her identity and doing what princesses do when they're attempting to get away... or something.
- Goes by Anna when she actually runs away. This becomes her accepted name (to herself and how she views herself.)

## Physical Description

Brown skin, dark brown eyes (almost black), black hair, medium-tall height for her people and sex (about 5' 5"). She's got a straight, strong nose, almond shaped eyes with long eyelashes, well defined lips, heart shaped face. She'd considered a beauty, but since she's a princess, but of course she is (who would say different?)

## Background

Anna is the second child and only daughter with three brothers. Her older brother is set to inherit the throne, while her two younger brothers (twins) are mostly set to de-flower much of the city's precious youth, preferably amidst a drunken stupor.

She will be expected to marry Royalty, largely to strengthen allies, but her father has mostly given her freedom to chose her own husband.  He doesn't believe in forcing it on her, and he trusts herâ€” she already knows the value of strengthening their position. It's something she was born to.

### Extroversion

Score: 7/10

Anna is extroverted and manipulative. Having grown up in the court, she's accustomed to not only getting her way, but also manipulating others to make sure it happens.  She's accustomed to power, in all its forms, and has no issues wielding it.

After running away, she tries to do away with those manipulative tendencies. She succeed instead to make them better, more subtle, and more genuine. She learns to identify with the 'common' man, and use it to her advantage.
