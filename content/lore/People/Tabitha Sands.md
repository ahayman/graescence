## Character Flaws

She's something of a romantic at heart and dreams of adventure. She would be an avid reader of fiction, if she could read and had access to books. She's hampered by her timid nature, though, and even when she goes with the gang, she finds herself uncertain of what to actually do. This results in her staying home more often than not when the rest of the gang goes out. She tells herself it's important, and she will do everything she can think to make sure everything is in order for them when they get back, but it's not the role she wants. She wants to open up; she just doesn't know how.

## Control

She controls the world through her actions, making sure everything is in order. She's almost neurotic in making sure everything is in its proper place. This can lead to tension with others, who become annoyed when their stuff is suddenly "moved" to its "proper place". Attempts to confront her about it don't work—she simply clams up—and she'll just end up doing it again when they aren't looking which, given her personality, is most of the time.
