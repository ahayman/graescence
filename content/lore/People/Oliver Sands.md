Oliver Sands is a orphan of the Ionia slave plantations. Abandoned as a child, he's never met his parents. Despite living in the slave plantations, Oliver has never been a slave, which he sometimes regretsâ€”slaves, at least, get to eat every day. He often does not.

Oliver's attitude and mouth do not lend themselves well to authority, which has alienated him from just about any gang he's encountered. Bouncing from group to group, he eventually fell in with a small group living on the fringes of society and stealing to meet their needs.
