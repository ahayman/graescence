Dia is a woman preoccupied with tech, and for good reason. She has a gift that allows her to understand tech in a way no one else can, and the drive to use it. Consumed with a driving desire to learn and create, Dia often ignores her friends, her own needs, and often just ignores reality itself. She's a woman in her head, but the real problems arise when what's in her head begins to make their way into the real world, a world not ready to handle what she's ready to create.

## Physical Description

Female, medium height and build, a little weight but not considered overweight, dark brown (almost black) straight hair. She has light brown skin, slightly slanted brown eyes with a medium-sized, straight nose and thin lips. She would be considered somewhere between Asian and Puerto Rican on Earth. She fits in and can be mostly ignored, drawing attention only when someone notices her beauty.

She generally wears well-made but as ordinary clothes as possible, preferring outfits that don't draw attention. Cardonians prefer long sleeves, an affectation due to living inside a mountain in a cooler climate. Women generally wear palazzo pants (pant legs fashioned like a long flowing skirt), with varying flairs, often more colorful than their male counterparts (who stick to slacks, though using the same flowing fabric). Dia does as well, though she prefers muted colors with less flair to draw attention.

Cardonian woman are known for their long black, silky hair, and hers is no different. But where most women would accentuate their beauty, often adding subtle braids or weaving ribbons, Dia's hair is normally pulled back into a pony-tail or a bun to keep it out of the way, both as a practicality, which would be more noticeable with her hair down (something her mother is constantly on her for). She would cut it if she could but her mother would kill her for it.

## Background

Born to a lower middle-class family, daughter of Jake and Sheary (Sher) Stanford.

Her father works as a low-level arms broker. He started as a paper pusher, submitting initial analysis of (usually) provincial needs to "true brokers" who would then work out agreements between the provinces and weapons manufacturers. After a some time, he made enough connections to broker his own agreements, but these were, while lucrative, infrequent and far between. More recently, he's begun to make a name for himself matching custom designs with the appropriate manufacturers, even going so far as converting specs, ensuring quality, and suggesting improvements. His grasp of both fundamental and even advanced gravtech design has earned him a reputation as the go-to for custom work, from both clients and manufacturers. This is much more consistent and lucrative work, though his firm retains most of the profits.

Antosa has thousands of manufacturers in the arms sector, ranging from one-person custom shops, to multi-billion chit plants churning out endless copies of lances or casters for the many armies of the Empire's provinces and the Empire's own army. Each manufacturer has their own strengths and weaknesses, and finding the best manufacturer can have a drastic effect on the end product. Navigating these manufacturers is a matter of tact and connections: thus brokers. And this is where Sheary comes in.

Sheary is a socialite, endlessly consumed with her (and her husband's) rising social status. She constantly plans dinners and parties, arranges lunches, etc. She's responsible for choosing their home which, in truth, is less home than showcase for whomever she's invited over. Her social arrangements are the primary driver behind Jake's success. Without the connections he's made from her arrangements, he would still be an overlooked paper pusher who submitted often brilliant, yet mostly ignored analysis.

Sheary and her daughter have a tense relationship. Sheary loves her daughter but doesn't understand her. She tries very hard to provide Dia with the same kind of opportunities she does for Jake, and for a teenage girl, Sheary can think of nothing better than to find for Dia a suitable husband. In her mind, she wants Dia to have what she and Jake have. Dia does not see it that way. Preoccupied mostly with her projects, Dia resents her mother's constantly trying to force on her "suitable mates", wasting precious time she could use to further her projects. She finds it "gross" to even attempt to facilitate (or in her mind, force) a relationship like that. She normally looks for every opportunity to avoid or, in the case that's not possible, undermine the opportunities her mother arranges for her.

## Personality Profile

Dia shares her mother's sense of order (though not in a way her mother would recognize) and inherited her father's brilliance (and more besides). She is highly intelligent, an unrecognized genius prodigy, and she takes it as given. She can be abrasive, but only out of ignoranceâ€” she doesn't see that she is. She uses wit as a wall against others, and prefers to keep in her own mind.

### Extroversion

Score: 3/10

Dia is introverted. She normally presents a witty, often snarky personality to the world, but it exhausts her. She spends most of her time with her projects. While she has had friends in the past, the constant moving "up" of her family has forced her to re-make new friends too often, so now she doesn't even try. She rationalizes this by characterizing the "new" people she meets as increasingly "stuffy" and "fake", and while this is undoubtably true for some, her broad characterizations cause her to miss true opportunities. When she does make friends, she makes them one on one, preferring fewer, deeper friendships than many shallow ones.

Her beauty catches eyes, but she mostly obscures it, not wanting the attention.

### Neurosis

Score: 7/10

Dia would not consider herself neurotic, and anyone who saw her workshop would not think so either, yet Dia could easily close her eyes and point out every single tool, every project, every discarded piece of wood in the shop. Chaos it may be, but it's _her_ chaos, and she knows it well. Her neurosis manifests not in orderly detail, but in always knowing where everything is. Instinctually, she places tools and projects in the most efficient place, where she can access them with the least effort. She might not consider herself neurotic, but woe to anyone who would mess with her chaos.

### Openness

Score: 2/10

She does not desire or need new experiences. Those that she seeks out, are usually for a specific purpose, and once she establishes a routine, she sticks to it, freeing her mind to focus on the things that truly matter: her projects. For example, her need of an inscriptor drove her out of her basement into the underworld, where she met Jed, a mostly illegal weapons seller who gave her a broken inscriptor in exchange for her producing with it "products" he could sell. Once that relationship was established, she never tried to alter it, instead supplying him with a constant supply of weapons while she got all the material she needed for her projects. She did not consider how much he makes of her work, nor how her product might be used, too far removed from it to even consider it. She lives most of the world in her head, often walks while solving problems, can easily be nerd-sniped, and in general, might be considered absent minded.

### Aggressiveness

Score: 4/10

Similar to her openness, she's aggressive only to a purpose. Most of the time, though, she'd rather avoid conflict and the drama that results, and this results in her acquiescing to other's demands right up to the point that they interfere with her own. She's mostly a "leave me alone and I'll leave you alone" kind of person. This may lead others to believe she's rather easy to push around, which is kind of true, but any who believe this is due to a weak soul will be in for an unpleasant surprise when they push too far.

She is not competitive, mostly due to the fact that she doesn't care if she wins or not. That, in her opinion, is quite opposed to the point of doing anything, which is the sheer enjoyment she gets out of creating something new. That, more than anything, is what drives her.

### Ego

Score: 8/10

Dia is intelligent, she knows it, and she's not beyond calling someone out for their perceived stupidity. She generally assumes she's right, and often is. She cannot see, however, that her own beliefs define her reality, instead assuming that she simply knows the truth. Moreover, she's perfectly capable of defending her truth to anyone. This leaves her fragile, and her own mind can trap her into self-fulfilling prophecies.

## Character Flaws

- Dia's assumption of always being right makes it difficult for her to change. Once she's convinced herself something, it's almost impossible for anyone to gainsay her. Those who disagree with her are labelled idiots and ignored. This goes for the negative judgements as well; once she's convinced herself something negative, it is exceedingly difficult for anyone to convince her otherwise.
- Dia's introversion plus snark makes it difficult to make friends. She often chases off the few would-be friends with ill-placed, often improper, commentary. She cannot see the effect of her insults, or even recognize them as such. Yet once she makes friends, she does so deeply. With her parent's constant "socializing" and moving, she's mostly given up making friends. She doesn't allow herself to recognize her own loneliness.
- Dia finds it easy to rationalize self-destructive behavior.

## Control

- When presented with a situation she can't control, Dia will withdrawal into the things she can control. In this case, she would dive into her projects or, in case those aren't available, into her mind to solve a puzzle, any puzzle.
- Early on, she discovers her penchant for retreat makes it easy for her to use measures to ensure it, including drugs.

## Prose

Dia has a tendency to notice space and patterns. Whether it's the layout of a room, or the way paint is brushed on, her eyes is drawn to these sorts of details. She'll notice how things are organized, their placement in a room. For instance, if the sun is shining on the floor, whereas Roland might notice the colors it makes, she would notice how it bisected the room at a specific angle.
