Andrea Sands is an orphan of the Ionia slave plantations as part of the same group that Oliver is part of. She tends to be the more level-headed one of the group, preferring caution to risk and often is the one that will play devil's advocate.

Like most, this isn't the first gang she's been in, but it is the longest. She carries issues from a prior gang that was wiped out by a boss, leaving her the only survivor.

She and Oliver often get in fights, as Oliver tends to have a more...optimistic approach to their plans. Despite their contentious relationship, Andrea often goes out of the way for Oliver, something that has spurred rumors amongst the rest of their group.

## Physical Description

Andrea is thin to the point of slightly malnourished, though that's normal for anyone with Sands as a last name. She's got a mop of curly blond hair, high cheek bones framing flat gray eyes, a strong jaw, and sunken cheeks.

## Personality Profile

Andrea has a contentious personality that is often condescending toward those she believes are acting stupid. Her contentious nature serves as a kind of bravado that hides deep insecurities over the instability and lack of control over her environment. She habitually looks at what can go wrong, and while others often find this tendency annoying, it has frequently proven very valuable when planning their heists.

### Extroversion

Score: 4/10

She is distrustful of outsiders and trusts slowly, seeking to keep her circle of friends small.

### Neurosis

Score: 7/10

Andrea seeks to control the world by looking at the worst possible outcomes and preparing herself for them. She creates contingencies in her head for every outcome she can think of, becoming anxious if there are scenarios she has no answer to. She'll fixate on those, worrying until she can come up with a solution, or else a new scenario grabs her attention, only relaxing when she feels she's accounted for everything.

Despite this, she does not tend to worry over catastrophic events or things too far outside her control. Her scenarios are more practical, representing the worse that can happen within the realm of reason.

### Openness

Score: 2/10

She is not open to new experiences, and shies away from them. They tax her, as her mind goes into overdrive trying to account for everything that could possibly go wrong. Ironically, this makes her the perfect person to attempt dangerous situations, as she's often accounted for setbacks before anyone else.

### Aggressiveness

Score: 6/10

She shuns violence, but makes up for it with biting words. She's not afraid to get in someone's face, and falls back on scorn to shame those who respond with physical threats.

### Ego

Score: 5/10

She paradoxically thinks low of herself, but lower of most others. Her problem is she doesn't view herself as particularly intelligent, but scorns those she views as being 'stupid'. Anyone who hasn't thought through the worst gets that label, though, which tends to be most people.

## Character Flaws

She drives others away with biting criticism, only respecting those who stand up to her.

## Control

Her particular method of maintaining control, always looking at the worst, tends to drive others away from her. Even in her friendships, she often feels estranged from them, usually because she's said something mean at some point and worries they're angry with her for it.

Most of her friends have learned to tolerate her unique outlook and think nothing of it. The estrangement is often only in her mind, but that leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy where she's become distant because she thinks they're angry at her. It can make her hard to approach.

The only person that's not true for is Oliver. He fights with her, and that makes her feel better. Partly because it proves he's actually considered what she has to say. But also, he refuses to give in to her pessimism.
