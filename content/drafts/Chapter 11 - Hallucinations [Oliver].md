# 11 | Hallucinations [Oliver]

"You're a git, an idiot, a moron. You know that, right? Cause I feel like you should know that."

Oliver cracked his eyes open, then groaned as the pinched face of the last girl he ever wanted to see resolved into view.

Andrea? Why did it have to be her? She was his least favorite person in the world.

"You're not real."

"That so? What possessed you to steal from a boss, eh? I mean, that's a new low of stupid, even for you."

"It was a good lead."

"That so?"

"Well, I _thought_ it was. Seemed legit."

"It 'seemed legit' _seems_ like a great way to water the desert."

"I ain't waterin' the desert...or not yet, anyway."

"Well, somethin' is."

She shifted her eyes from him to stare into the distance. He sat up and followed her gaze out over more water than he'd ever seen in his life. More than ever thought possible to exist. No matter how many times he'd gazed upon Rotaka's seas, they were always so small looking. This? This took his breath away.

A perfectly still surface mirrored strands of glowing green that arced along the walls of the cave until they met the stalactites above. Some moss even draped down a few of the stalactites until they met the water, soaking it up while generating their bioluminescence.

There was no end to it. The cave ceiling only extended maybe a hundred paces above him, but it receded into a green horizon.

Occasionally, a small drip of water would fall from one of the stalactites, causing the mirrored image to ripple outward before settling.

"Wha..."

"Eloquent."

"Shuddup. You're not even real."

"That so?"

"I hate it when you say that." He frowned at the sea of water, then turned to her. "How is this even poss—wait, why are you in color?"

It was impossible not to see it once he noticed, but everything was cast in green except her, who stood out as oddly vibrant.

Which, now that he was noticing things, the world felt...weird. The stalactites kept shifting positions, and that green horizon was wobbly.

"You're an idiot."

"Right, I'm hallucinating, and you're not real."

"You keep saying that."

"I keep forgetting."

"Because you're a—"

"Get off it, already! Hells below, but why did I have to hallucinate you?"

"Well, I have a theory—"

"Nope." He stood, then faltered as the ground flowed under him like fluid sand shifting beneath his feet. He braced himself on a stalagmite until the feeling passed, which it did not do.

"Ugh, this sucks. How do people stand this?"

"Pretty sure most people don't drink contaminated water...because they're not idiots."

"Not like I had a choice," he growled.

Andrea replied with a familiar flat expression, to which he rolled his eyes.

That insufferable girl had always been a constant, near-endless source of negativity. You're an idiot, Oliver. You can't do that, Oliver. Why don't try real work someday, Oliver?

And his well-reasoned, perfectly logical arguments? All replied with a flat, sarcastic, 'That so?'.

Gods but he hated those words.

He pushed off the stalagmite he'd braced against...then froze because he'd done so with his bad arm.

He slowly looked over at it and...yep, still dislocated.

"Weird...why can't I feel the pain?"

"Because you're an—"

"Don't say—no...I can feel the pain." But it was distant, like a fact you knew about someone else.

"Huh..."

"Uh oh. You're gonna do something stupid."

He turned to the vibrant, definitely-not-real Andrea, and shrugged.

"You know what, this time, you're right. I'm definitely going to do something stupid."

Oliver Sands then ran full speed at the cave wall.

The impact against his shoulder sent a massive, searing pain through...someone else's body. He knew the pain was his own because he felt it. Yet, at the same time, he didn't. Again, it felt more like a fact than any real experience. The disassociation might have been a fascinating study of the human mind, except Oliver couldn't care less about such things. He only looked at his shoulder and twisted his lips at finding he hadn't fixed it.

Perhaps it required another try?

He spent the next several minutes flinging himself at the cave wall. A small, albeit minuscule, part of his mind offered up the notion that this behavior was not only abnormal and dangerous but quite likely insane.

Oliver just couldn't be bothered to care less.

After some time at this, he discovered his mouth had gotten dry again. So he did the only rational thing a person with a dry mouth would do.

He drank the water, again.

And that's when things got interesting. Pain stopped being someone else's problem. Instead, it became color.

Every time he hit the wall, new complex colors exploded into his mind. And by complex, he meant _complex_. It was a tapestry of sensation he could never properly put into words. Yet each gradation of intimate hue invited him to partake, offering itself like a well-bosomed woman. He couldn't understand them at all (either of them) but he could replicate the sensation.

And so he did, again and again, while explosions of color filled his perception but, oddly, not his vision. After some measure of time that Oliver couldn't possibly perceive in his state, the colors began to lose their vibrancy. No matter how he flung himself at the wall, their inspiration fled from him until he was left with a drab, flat impression of insipid pigments.

It was only then that he considered looking back at his bruised and discolored shoulder, only to find it fixed. Or, at least, not dislocated. The shoulder was very swollen and angry but, for some reason, that was no longer sufficient to create any more prismatic tapestries.

"Ah..."

He briefly considered the effort it would take to dislocate his shoulder again but then discarded the idea as too much work. Besides, he was starting to get hungry.

As it turned out, Oliver had luck by the throat, because there was plenty of food around. It even announced itself with a pleasant green glow.

Oliver wasted no time in shoving it into his mouth. Chewing it, though, was far more work than he anticipated. Every bite seemed to take forever before turning into a paste he could swallow. But he persisted, if only because his hunger was a cruel taskmaster.

Eventually, his stomach distended so far he thought it might burst. He couldn't help but wonder what the colors would be if that happened, but some primitive part of him kept him from trying, if only because it was too much effort.

Satiated, he rolled over onto his back and promptly fell asleep.

---

Oliver woke up in pain...and to the sound of dripping water.

He couldn't decide which was worse.

The pain had changed, he noted. No longer a dormant wound coupled with knife-like nerve pain at every motion, it simply throbbed now. Over and over, pulsing like a tide of sands, pushing and pulling endlessly at his sanity.

Oliver once again considered the effort it would take to dislocate his shoulder, but he kind of doubted the pain would go back to what it was before. And again, it felt like too much work.

Another solution presented itself, and rather strongly at that. He stared at the endless water.

He remembered the colors.

Now that he was lucid, or something approaching sane, the experience sat strangely within him. Like a new muscle that twitched occasionally, or perhaps a new sense?

Yes, that was it. A new sense. It wasn't just color. It wasn't even color. It's not like he physically saw the tapestry. He perceived it like a blind man would real color. Something new.

Or maybe. He had no idea what it was like for a blind man to see, but the analogy stuck in his head. It was a new perception, a different way to view reality.

Oliver squeezed his eyes shut, searching within himself to open up that perception again. There was nothing to grab hold of and after a few minutes, he gave up.

The water was his only ticket.

But first, he should explore.

He got up, careful of his shoulder. The throbbing increased some, but that was it. He slowly worked his arm around and again the pain crested, but there was none of the shooting pain that threatened to drive him unconscious.

Satisfied he wouldn't randomly pass out and drown himself—a rather novel concept—he set to explore his corner of the cavern, or beach. Or sea? Ocean? Or whatever it was.

He walked along the edge of the water on sand, of all things. That was curious. Sand was everywhere, of course, but it was rare to see so much of it this deep underground.

Of course, he had no idea how deep he'd fallen, which was itself a concerning thought he quickly shoved to the back of his head.

The cave wall eventually cut off his beach after a hundred paces or so, jutting out into the water. He'd have to go in that water to continue, which was not a thing he was willing to do. He had no idea how deep the water was and he had no idea how to swim. He doubted any Ionian did.

Kids loved to talk about what might be in the waters of Rotaka, spinning tales of Krakens and monsters the size of boats waiting to gobble up unwary sailors.

They were just stories made up by bored children.

He knew they were stories.

He took a step back from the water anyway. There was something insidious about how the water reflected everything above it, hiding its depths from prying eyes. Anything could be down there, anything at all.

At least the darkness was honest in how it hid the world. The water lied, pretending to be a thing it was not.

Also, he may not have been as sober as he'd thought.

Oliver shook off his musings and continued exploring, albeit a few more paces from the water.

The other side of his beach was barely any better. Another part of the cave wall jutted out, blocking his path. This one had a crack in it, though, and when he looked through it, he caught a faint glow of green on the other side. The crack was only a couple fingers wide, far too thin for him to fit through.

Aside from the hole he came in from, there was nothing else. Just a thin strip of beach that ran maybe two hundred paces.

And an ocean of hallucinogenic water.

Eventually, he'd have to go in that water. There was no way he could climb back up the shaft he'd fallen down, even if he had two good arms. If there even _was_ a shaft anymore with the way Ionia had tossed about lately.

The only encouraging aspect of the cavern was the stalagmites and stalactites. They were large, thick pillars that descended to rounded points from the ceiling. He even saw shadows of thick columns rising in the distance. Truly massive stalagmites that had merged with their heavenly cousins above.

Such things didn't exist on Ionia. They required water, and Ionia had none. The only reason Oliver knew anything about them was from stories they heard of Rotaka, and most of those were of the mountain city-nation of Caldonia. Probably because they lived underground too.

What he knew of these water-born formations was all hearsay, but they all agreed on one thing: formations like this took time. A lot of time.

Which meant this cavern was unbelievably stable.

Also, Ionia had water, which itself was a revelation that could entirely upend the Empire's occupation, something most considered impossible. The lack of water was the primary reason no revolution ever truly succeeded. They needed the Empire, no matter how badly it treated them.

Revolutions were never about kicking out the Empire. They were always about getting more supplies. A fair share.

Until now.

Or, at least, until Oliver could escape and tell someone.

That was a problem for future him, though. First, he wanted to see if he could explore the colors again.

He made his way back to where he started for no other reason than it was familiar. After taking a few good gulps of water, he plopped down in the same spot he'd fallen asleep earlier.

He immediately jumped back up, rubbing his butt.

"Oww..."

The sand was barely a finger deep. After a few seconds of digging through it, Oliver pulled out a small, perfectly round, purple ball that almost looked black in the green glow of the cavern.

"Oh, you." He flung it up into the air and caught it on the back of his hand. "All of this for...a marble."

When he got out of this mess, Oliver Sands was going to beat the ever-living shit of the boy who sold him...a trap. His eyes narrowed on the ball. Yes, a trap. It was the only explanation he could think of that made sense.

He lay on his back and lifted the marble over him, examining it while he tried to understand what had happened. The simplest argument was the boy made a mistake, but the timing was suspicious. For the gang boss to show up right when Oliver was ransacking his treasury closet? Especially since Oliver knew the boss should have been out?

No. That was simply too much coincidence to be believable.

"But did the boy know?"

"Mike?" Oliver's eyes drifted from the ball to a large, heavy-boned man with prominent cheekbones, a sharp jaw, and whispy blond hair. Also, he was in full color. "Ah, at least you're not Annie."

"You know Andrea hates that nickname."

"Yep."

"Right, well. Back to my question. Did the 'boy' know? Also, have you considered trying to remember people's names?"

"No, not really."

"Might help."

"I doubt the boy knew. It'd ruin his reputation as a broker, assuming he has one."

Mike sat on a stalagmite and nodded. "He did seem new at it, which begs the question of where the information came from."

Oliver frowned at him, trying to figure out how he was sitting like that. Sitting on a pointed object should have been extremely uncomfortable, but Mike didn't look bothered in the least. Also, had the stalagmite shrunk? He was pretty sure it'd been a lot taller a few seconds ago.

"Oh, right, you're not real."

"Of course not, but my question stands."

Oliver rolled his eyes. "Fine. So someone fed the boy lies to trap me."

"Right, now who would want to do that?"

Oliver snorted. Too many names on that list. He'd stolen from a lot of people. Not all knew he was the one to abscond with their stuff, but more than enough did, or at least suspected.

"Wasn't the guy I stole this from, that's for sure." He chuckled as he rolled the marble between his fingers. "That look on his face was almost worth all this."

After a few seconds, Oliver shifted his gaze back to Mike. Instead, there was a pillar of stone that had reverted back to its original size.

"Need more water," Oliver grunted as he sat back up.

Reality shifted beneath him and suddenly he was at the shore. He swayed on his feet, waiting for the vertigo to pass before he bent over the sea.

He blinked and he was laying on his back in the sand, his stomach almost painfully full. He had no memory of drinking or walking back or laying down.

"Uh..."

He looked around for Mike, but his friend remained absent. He briefly considered that it might be best if the threw up some of the water, but it suddenly didn't seem important anymore.

The colors had come back.

This time, they weren't pain, which was good. Very good. Oliver might have been tempted to bash his head against the rock for it otherwise.

Instead, the colors were something else, something outside him. Or maybe they were him? That particular line felt blurred and unimportant. He was floating inside himself, rocking lightly back and forth, almost ready to spill out.

The world had twisted, and with it came the tapestry. It pulsed outward from his hand, wrapping around the vibrant purple marble which somehow, impossibly, was wrapping itself around reality and warping it.

The marble was the colors. He was the colors. He was holding a marble that was wrapped space itself with color. A heady experience.

Ripples of distortion spun around him. The cave ceiling was suddenly within reach, then it was a hundred leagues away. Every time he moved his head, reality either moved too slowly or too quickly, as though his motion had no consistent impact on the world.

With every twist of the fabric of space, a tapestry of color wove between the spaces of reality using impossible directions. The shape of the tapestry was likewise impossible, making him certain he was only seeing a small part of the whole. A whole that only partially intersected the very dimensions within which he lived.

The colors pulled apart what was real, stretched and compressed parts, rearranging others. Oliver was certain he would be throwing up everything in his stomach if that water hadn't removed himself from his own body.

He would follow those colors. He would expand himself beyond this paltry existence and become something more.

He would if he knew how.

Tears began to roll down his face as he realized he was missing so much. So much color, so much shape was hidden beneath directions that didn't exist, dimensions hidden from reality. Places he couldn't follow.

He wanted to embrace it all. Instead, he watched what little of the tapestry he could see.

There were patterns in it, designs that tickled his mind, tempting him with revelations before dancing away. No matter how he chased them, they remained just out of reach.

He eventually stopped trying. There was no point. The moment he came close to touching the smallest fragment of understanding, it fled into another dimension.

A new revelation came to him, that you needn't understand a thing to enjoy it. So he relaxed and simply watched the colors twist and move, tickling his mind with slivers of understanding he refused to grasp for.

In time, the colors began to fade. It could have been seconds; it could have been years. Time had let go of its hold on the world, making it impossible to tell.

When he came back to himself, two facets of reality dug into him. He was hungry. Very, _very_ hungry.

Also, he'd peed himself quite thoroughly.

Oliver considered washing himself off but quickly nixed the idea of swimming in the probably-not-but-possibly monster-infested waters. Also, he was drinking that water. No need to foul it up.

After a meal that took entirely too long to chew, he eagerly gulped down more water and lay on his back, waiting for the colors to come back to him.

They did, and like before, they danced around reality, shaping space at their whim.

A simple rhythm was developed. Oliver ate, drank, and watched the prismatic tapestry, with brief interludes of sleep blended in. Occasionally he shat, and he kept that far away from the water. The cave began to stink, or he did. Both probably, not that he much cared. The colors were everything.

He eventually got bored of laying on his back, so he took walks up and down the beach. Slowly, at first, since the disorientation of the constant shifting space around him was quite severe. Over time he grew accustomed to it, and the colors of walking were even more fascinating than the colors of laying on his back.

At times it felt like was moving between space rather than through it.

Eventually, he noticed something odd. The colors hung around, even after the water's effect wore off. At first, it was slight, more like a memory of sensation than the sense itself. He dismissed it as imagination or, perhaps more likely, after affects from the water.

The effect built on itself. Each time the water wore off, the colors lingered a little longer, their vibrancy refusing to fade even as the bliss became harder to grasp.

Oliver couldn't help but hope the effect would be permanent. There was an ocean of water to drink from, and it wasn't enough. He had to drink more and more to keep the colors coming. He feared the day would come when he could not drink enough, but the fear was distant and slipped through through the widening cracks of his mind.

He eventually forgot about anything except the water and the colors.
