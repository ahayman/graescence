# 51 | Absurd [Roland]

The next morning, Roland walked out into the late autumn cold. His breath came out in white puffs, barely lit up by the diffuse light of a sun not yet daring to breach the mountainous horizon.

He walked over to the weapons cabinet and grabbed a medium sized practice sword. He paused; it was absurd that he could handle this thing. It was absurd that he might handle the largest some day, something he once could barely lift. His life was full of absurdities.

He shook his head, removed the sword, and placed himself center of the courtyard. It would be at least half an hour before Rose would emerge to train him, and he'd long since discovered that practicing his forms tended to result in fewer bruises. He wasn't quite sure that was due to Rose or to him. He wasn't sure it mattered.

He quickly lost himself in the rhythm, and before long had to shed his coat. He continued, moving from form to form, slow vinyasas of attack and defense, each a mimed illusion of a slice of battle, each slowly embedding themselves into muscle and memory.

"I do not recognize those forms," a melodic voice said in clipped tones.

Roland spun, and only then did he notice a shape on the bench highlighted between long shadows cast by the morning sun. Terra, a book in one hand, presumable read by the first rays of morning. She wore an embroidered white shirt matched with the same deep blood-red pants he'd noticed the day before. Of her weird coat, he saw no sign.

"Do you normally spy so early in the morning?" He almost regretted the words.

She chuckled lightly, the sound filling the courtyard with a light sound. She seemed to take no offense, though he wasn't sure he'd know if she had.

"I do rise early," she said, "but to nothing so nefarious as spying. I simply like to watch the morning's sun."

He gestured at her book. "And read, it seems."

She dipped her head. "A morning ritual, I've found, to help center the day."

Roland opened his mouth, but the squeak of a door drew him around. Rose entered the courtyard, wearing her traditional blood-red shirt combined with black pants. He walked back to the courtyard center, eyeing Rose as one would a dangerous predator. She retrieved her own practice weapon and met him.

Without a word, they began to spar.

Within moments Roland lost himself trying to survive her onslaught. The clack of their weapons filled the courtyard in a chaotic staccato. At her whim, Rose would penetrate his defense, delivering yet another bruise or even drawing blood, and then calmly explain what he did wrong, only to start back up again immediately. He'd long ago learned to listen, and while he attempted to apply her lessons, Rose remained beyond him as the sun was to the moon. It didn't matter what he did, how he learned, or how well he applied her lessons, she would always tear apart his defenses with the ease of breathing.

The bruises built and as hours passed, Roland began to slow. The sun was well into the sky before Rose called training done. He was exhausted, with his hands on knees as a sweat soaked shirt shed the excess water onto the ground. Rose said nothing else, but simply replaced her weapon and walked into the house.

"I cannot say I have ever seen the like," Terra spoke from behind, but this time with a quiet intensity.

Roland turned to see Terra standing, her book closed and set aside on the bench. Her head was cocked, as though she'd seen something she didn't quite understand, a puzzle with a missing piece.

Just then, Ven walked out of the barracks, somehow looking both as though he'd just woken up and yet somehow had wasted hours grooming his clothes. He stopped at the sight of Roland and cocked his head.

"My dear servant boy," he said in a tone dripping with sarcasm, "I believe the water bucket is supposed to go in some kind of reservoir and not over your head."

Roland stared at him, uncertain. He couldn't believe the boy stupid, and so he knew the words were intended as offense, yet...

"You need better insults," he said. He didn't quite mean it as an insult, more as an observation. He didn't quite mean it not to be an insult either.

"Or simply fewer," Terra said.

Ven looked Roland over once more, shook his head in mock disbelief, then turned to Terra.

"Training begins in an hour, dear sis. I recommend lunch."

If anything, Terra looked startled by the proclamation. She glanced up at the sky, gathered up her book, and headed back toward the barracks. Roland replaced his practice sword and walked to the house. He still had lunch and his tutor to attend, which meant he would miss at least a couple hours of their training.

That bothered him. Already he was set apart from the other students, something different that didn't quite belong. He knew enough to not expect to fit in — Rose had been quite clear about where he stood in the Empire — yet knowing it was not the same as feeling it, and now he felt it. It was presumed inferiority, the expectation of failure, and the surprise at success, as though they'd seen a monkey speak. They would never actively stand in his way, but neither would they deign to open a door either, and a closed door was just as effective a tool for segregation.

For the first time, he began to truly understand how Sal must have felt most his life. Roland had always thought he was protecting Sal from bullies, but now he began to realize there was something else far more important he'd given Sal: a place to belong. It was something Roland could have used about then.

He paused at the door, his back tingling. He turned to see Terra watching him, propping the door open absently with her foot. Her expression wasn't something he could parse.

---

"I truly cannot understand why you are here," Ven said a tired tone, his face currently upside down.

Roland stifled a moan, rolled over onto his stomach, and pushed himself up.

"That's not surprising."

"And why is that, servant boy?" Ven's tone held a warning.

Roland rolled his shoulder, working out a bit of soreness from landing on it. Ven was almost as good as his sister at throws, and between the two of them, Roland wasn't sure he spent more time on his back than on his feet.

"You can't see beyond your nose."

Ven blinked slowly, his body tensed, and Roland thought he might attack right then, but instead he glanced behind Roland at Master Yeng and then narrowed his eyes at Roland.

"There is nothing to see," again he looked Roland up and down, "but a servant pretending to be what he's not."

Roland barked out a laugh. "Is that the only insult you can think of, to call me a servant?" He spread his arms out in mock invitation. "Do you really believe it's so bad to be a servant... or that you're so much better?"

Roland didn't think someone with Ven's skin tone could turn red. He was wrong. He shouldn't provoke the boy, he knew that — Ven was far beyond Roland in his martial training — but remove the fancy language and Ven was little better than the bullies of his hometown. None of Ven's insults pierced his skin, though, and had all Ven done was insult Roland, he'd likely have ignored it; he'd even ignore Ven's attempts to hurt him — the boy held nothing on what Rose did each morning. But he hadn't stopped at Roland. He'd been doing the same to Ashter, throwing veiled insults and harsh blows.

And Ashter just took it. _That_ Roland couldn't stand, and it seemed to drive his mouth of its own accord.

"Or are you truly so threatened by a servant? Do you feel yourself so inferior that you must hit them? Insult them? Does that make you feel—"

"Rotate!"

Roland turned around to see Master Yeng giving him a warning look. When he turned back, Ven was stalking away, fists curled, and in his place Roland found Terra.

"I would ask you to not provoke him so," she said quietly enough that only Roland could hear. "I fear he's not had much practice in handling it."

"And that's a good reason for him to do whatever he wants?"

Roland winced at the harshness of his words and took a moment to calm himself. He liked Terra, and couldn't understand at all how she was related to the fiend. But she also seemed to habitually cover for her lesser sibling, which seemed provoke almost as much anger in Roland as did Ven's treatment of others.

"No, but he is van."

Roland frowned. "I don't—"

"Begin!"

Roland startled at Master Yeng's command. He'd been standing right behind him when he yelled it out.

"Spar now. Talk later, please," Master Yeng said in a much quieter voice.

Roland took a deep breath and set his weight evenly on his legs, but didn't turn back to Master Yeng, who was probably glaring at him anyway. Terra's eyes darted between Roland and Master Yeng behind him. After a moment, she dipped her head in acknowledge and stepped up.

Another short moment later, Roland was on the ground, Terra standing over him. Unlike her brother, she did not throw insults but instead offered him a hand. He took it, allowing her to help him up; she was solidly built.

"What's a van?"

She cocked her head, brow lifted, looking a little surprised. It passed quickly. She stepped up and into a stance; Roland followed suite.

The problem with Terra was her mobility and speed... and flexibility. And strength. And training.

Actually, there was whole lot of reasons she was impossible to take down. But the biggest problem Roland had was the way she placed herself where he couldn't really reach her, all while giving her free reign to grapple him, throw him, kick him, twist his arm— really, she demonstrated a remarkable variety of methods to take him down.

The best way to approach Terra was at range, preferably where she couldn't touch him. This proved to be difficult when they were training grapples, something Roland had only learned about three days ago.

She lunged forward in a classic, but simple move designed to close distance quickly and take an opponent off guard. He was half way to countering before he realized it was a feint. A moment later she was somehow on the other side of him, his arm caught in the crux of her elbow. She shifted behind him and swept his feet, sending him falling back onto his arm, which she held in place.

He sighed. That shoulder was going to ache tonight.

A loud crack drew his attention; Ashter was staggering back with his hand on his face. As Master Yeng approached, Ven stepped back with his hands spread out.

"I'm afraid we've had an accident. Wan here hasn't quite learned to keep his face positioned for his counters."

Master Yeng stopped a couple paces from them and looked at Ashter. Ashter wiped blood from his nose, but after a moment he nodded to Master Yeng.

A flare of heat burned through Roland's stomach, forcing his hands into fists. He'd taken a step before a gentle hand pulled him back.

"Heir," Terra said.

Roland half turned, his blood still boiling, but her word had thrown him. "What?"

"Van is a title. It means heir. He is heir to the seat of the Borian spire."

"The heir to the what?" He turned to her fully.

Surprise lifted her brow. "How..." she stopped, looking confused, then shook her head. "From where do you hail?"

Roland pushed down his irritation. "A small, remote, mountain _village_."

"Ah well, remote, of course," she sounded as though it were anything but. Instead of answering, she stepped back up and settled into a stance.

A brief glance revealed Ven and Ashter already sparring and Master Yeng looking at Roland with a questioning glance. He growled to himself in frustration, but stepped up, fully expecting to end up on his back yet again. He kept one eye on Ven.

A few moves later and he was on the ground as expected. He hardly noticed. Ven was oddly fond of his elbows, and while he never appeared to strike directly at Ashter with them, he always raised them in such a way as to make it likely as he pranced around the other boy.

"To seat a spire makes one a great power in the Empire," she said as she pulled him up. "My mother holds the position currently, but he is heir."

"And so that means it's okay to treat others like shit?"

Terra's lips pinched, and Roland immediately regretted his words. Ven was still her brother after all.

"It is never quite so simple as that. To be heir does bring great power, yes, but also a crushing burden and all too often a life cut short."

Roland stared at her. He huffed out his anger through his nose. "It still doesn't give him the right."

Terra's back stiffened and, for a moment, he saw a little of Rose in her imperious stance.

"Perhaps not," she said, her words terse and clipped.

She said nothing else as they continued to spar. He was lucky if a match lasted more than a few seconds; he truly spent more time on the ground than on his feet with her. She appeared increasingly frustrated as they continued, and he mirrored it well; more than once he had to bite off his sarcasm. He set it aside, still intent on watching Ven as much as he could. The boy was getting increasingly aggressive with Ashter.

"You're not even trying," Terra said, exasperated, as she pulled him back to his feet.

Roland didn't hear her. Ven was once again lifting his elbow, but this time he stretched it out just a little too much as he spun. The position of his body, the way he leaned in; the arc of elbow; he saw it clearly. Ashter was trying to counter, to move around, but he wouldn't make it, and that elbow would drive right into his temple.

Roland braced himself and _pulled_ on Ven. Not much, just enough to shift Ven's balance. His elbow grazed the bridge of Ashter's nose, causing him to flinch back.

Ven stumbled but caught himself. He somehow looked both enraged and confused, which was satisfying, but Roland wasn't done. He launched his fist at the imbecile's face; Ven never even saw him.

Ven hit the ground, catching himself on his palms. He stayed there, breathing hard. His hands curled into fists. He pushed himself up and launched at Roland, roaring. The moron had abandoned any semblance of training in lieu of unrestrained rage.

Roland couldn't help but smile as the other boy rushed him. Now _this_ was the kind of fight Roland knew well.

He braced himself and, at just before Ven's last step, Roland _pulled_, causing the boy to stumble forward. Roland grunted as Ven impacted his stomach. Bracing on his back foot, Roland increased his _pull_, effectively glueing Ven to him. He launched himself back, twisting his body around and bringing Ven along. Halfway through the arc, he let go his _pull_ and body slammed Ven down into the courtyard stone, himself on top.

Roland landed six blows to Ven's face before Master Yeng pulled him off.

Terra reached down to help, but Ven slapped Terra's proffered hand away and pushed himself up. His lip was swollen, eye bruised, and nose bloodied, but his rage had been pushed down into something like suppressed hate. He walked to within a couple paces of Roland.

Master Yeng made to move between them. "I believe some time—"

"Shut it, old man," Ven snapped, then pushed Master Yeng back.

To Roland's surprise, Master Yeng let him.

Ven lifted his head, looking down on Roland. The only sign of his anger was a flared nose, and when he spoke, he did so as though reciting a proclamation.

"I will find every thing you love and burn it to the ground. I will make you watch as I turn to ash all you hold dear. I will hold no pity at your tears and no mercy at your pleas. Only once I've destroyed all you care for will I allow you to die as a broken shell. This, I, Vandor van Belcia, do swear."

Roland's mouth dropped open in astonishment. Everyone had fallen silent, even Master Yeng. Ashter's brow appeared to be hiding in his hair. Terra stared at her brother apoplectic, but there was also fear in her eyes. For whom she feared, Roland didn't know, but he could only think it was for him. She feared what her brother would do to him.

It was absurd, everything. His whole life was absurd; _he_ was absurd.

It first came out as wheezing flow of air, forcing Roland to fight his own stomach to stand. His voice caught a moment later, shattering the silence in a horrible dissonance that settled somewhere between a Jackret's yip and a hacking cough.

"Are you... laughing?" Ven's tone held bafflement.

He was indeed laughing. But it felt nothing like laughing. It felt like something was crawling up his stomach, through his chest, and ripping its way out of his throat, only to start all over again.

He couldn't stop. His hands were braced on his knees and even then he felt moments from falling over. His stomach rhythmically pulled at him so that he could barely breath. His whole torso ached.

"I fail to see how this is funny."

Ven's voice had grown cold. He could be moments from attacking and Roland was as vulnerable as he'd ever been. He couldn't fight now even if he wanted to. Ven could beat him to death and all Roland could do was cough out this terrible laugh, right up to the end.

He sensed movement, so he threw up a hand. "No! Wait... just... just give me a second."

He barely forced the bubbling monstrosity back down into his stomach, just enough to allow him to stand. But then his eyes landed on Ven's face. Rage had flared the boy's nose into the size of a balloon.

Roland doubled over again, and the noise that came out was now more cough than laugh. Tears ran down his face.

"I've had enough—"

"But they're dead!" Roland looked up at Ven, keeping his hands on his knees for support against a body that would drag him into the ground. "They're all dead! Everyone! Don't you see? I saw the holes in them!"

In a single moment, the laughter fled his body, leaving an empty shell behind. His breath evened out into a slow cadence, leaving only a horrible silence to fill the courtyard.

Roland stood and, ignoring the horror on their faces, stared Ven right in his eyes.

"Momma and pappa had holes in them. Th... then they burned. Everyone burned. There's nothing left but ash. Nothing left for you to burn." He took two steps and placed himself right before Ven who, to his credit, didn't flinch. "I'm already broken. What's left for you to do?"

Ven stared at him and swallowed hard, looking very confused. Roland shoved him hard, almost tripping him, though the boy caught himself in time. Ven's hand balled into fists, but relaxed a moment later.

"Well?" Roland walked back up and shoved him again, sending him back only a couple steps this time. "You swore, didn't you?"

"P-Please stop."

"You _said_ it. You swore!" Roland screamed, then shoved at him but Ven stepped aside and Roland stumbled.

"I will not," Ven said, voice firm, but his eyes betrayed fear.

Roland stared at him for a long time, his breath coming deep and hard. His lip curled in disgust.

"Coward," Roland snarled and glared at him. But Ven refused to be baited. Finally, Roland shook his head in disgust, though he wasn't sure at whom it was directed. Probably himself.

It had all happened so quickly, and now all he felt was numb and empty and confused.

"I need a puzzle," he said suddenly and turned away from Ven.

Terra's voice echoed clearly as Roland walked away. "You, dear brother, are perhaps the greatest fool I've had the pleasure of knowing."

Roland walked to the puzzle box and searched through its contents until he found something he knew was beyond him, an interlocking set of perhaps a dozen rings or more that probably had some ridiculous requirements to solve.

He yanked out the puzzle and turned toward the door, then paused. The door stood open, Rose just beyond it. She'd seen the whole thing, probably orchestrated the whole thing, but for his very life he couldn't find it in him to care.

Rose grabbed his arm as he brushed by her. He stopped, leaving empty eyes trained ahead on the darkness of the house beyond.

"You cannot touch the pieces, nor allow them to touch any surface, not even each other."

He waited for her to let go, then continued into the house, up the stairs, and into his room.

He threw the puzzle in the middle of the floor and sat in front of it, his back facing the bed. The puzzle was a catastrophe of interlocking circles. He grabbed a piece and lifted, bringing the whole mass up. He grabbed another and repeated the process. Each ring was entwined with at least three others that he could see.The completed puzzle would certainly be some complex shape, though he couldn't see it yet.

He could not touch the pieces. Odd requirement. It had to be a graetech puzzle — they all were — but how do you feed graessence without touching it? They always required touch.

Or, so he'd always assumed.

Curious, he _pulled_ on a piece from his hand. It was difficult to do so with a light enough touch to not immediately glue the piece to him. He then did the same with his other hand, and the puzzle pulled into the air from the two anchored pieces.

It wobbled and veered, taking all of Roland's concentration to keep it in the middle. Just like with the trees, balance was incredibly difficult. Slight changes in distance resulted in large differences in the energy required. At this level, it was barely a thread of _pull_ compared to flying — if what he did could could even be called that — but the shift in energy was the same. The puzzle kept veering off toward his hands.

Once he got it stable, he tried a third _pull_ from the tip of his finger, but it proved too much. The other two _pulls_ destabilized causing the puzzle to snap to his finger.

"Ow."

Well, it wasn't like he was supposed to solve it like this anyway; Rose didn't even know he could _pull_. Likely, he was supposed to figure out how to feed graessence without touch... and then do it in some stupidly precise manner that solved the puzzle.

He spent about an hour on it before a knock on his door startled him.

He stared at it, uncertain. No one had ever knocked on his door before.

The knock repeated itself.

"Come in?"

The door opened, and Terra took two steps in before pausing. Her eyes took in the whole room, then found Roland on the floor with his puzzle. They widened for just a moment, as though she had a realization, but vanished a moment later. She sat down opposite of him, cross-legged, and shifted her eyes between Roland and the puzzle. Twice she took a breath to speak, but then seemed to think better of it. Her eyes settled on the puzzle.

"What is it?"

"Puzzle."

"Ah, of course. I don't think I've seen its like."

Roland let out a soft snort. "You say that a lot."

"I do? Oh! Yes, I suppose I do." She frowned at the puzzle. "How does it work?"

Roland shrugged. "Dunno how to solve it. Supposed to feed it graessence, but you can't touch it, and it can't touch anything else."

"Doesn't seem possible." She cocked her head, "except perhaps..."

Roland waited, the raised his brow when she didn't continue. She seemed lost in herself for moment, but then took a deep breath.

"There is a trait, perhaps, that could solve the puzzle."

"A trait?"

She stared at him, then blinked. "It is... an inherent ability. A thing you do without thinking of it. It's uncommon, but not entirely rare. Some can feed graessence at a distance, though it's usefulness is of question. I understand it takes much more effort than to touch the graetech directly and it is not, as far as I'm aware, a thing that can be taught. One is born with a trait; you do not learn it."

"Oh, you mean like this?"

And then Roland did the dumbest thing he'd ever done in his life. He _pulled_ from both his hands and lifted the puzzle between them. And just like that, he exposed his greatest secret to a girl he met yesterday. He heart thudded beneath his concentration.

The puzzle wobbled for a moment, the settled to floating between them. He was oddly proud of that.

Terra let out a small gasp, bringing her hand to her mouth. "I... I don't think I've ever seen—", she paused. Her eyes lifted to meet his. She smiled self-deprecating, and continued, "I've never seen someone do that before."

Roland shrugged and let the puzzle drop to the floor while he tried hard to control his heart. He'd sworn no one would know, and yet nothing could take back what he'd just done.

"Hmm," she looked at him intently, "you can do that with a person?"

In answer, he anchored to her center mass and _pulled_ lightly.

"Oh..." her breath caught, then her eyes widened. She let out a delighted laugh. "Oh! My poor brother, so elegant in his footwork—"

"You mean he prances around?"

She pressed her smile into her lips and tilted her head. "As I said, and then he suddenly stumbles about like a drunken fool. I'd though him consumed by rage but..."

She looked at him in question.

Roland shrugged. "He was pretty angry."

She nodded as though he'd spoken wisdom. "That he was."

They fell silent. Roland poked at the puzzle a little and then, figuring it didn't matter anyway, he _pulled_ from his hands, trying again to make a third anchor work while Terra watched on with a distracted frown.

He looked up sheepishly after the puzzle snapped to his hands for the fifth time. "It's not very easy to do."

"But it is an incredible advantage, I daresay one not easily overcome." She leaned back. "This all makes sense now."

Roland frowned at her. "What does?"

She hesitated. "I mean no offense, truly, but my brother was right. There was no reason for anyone to put so much effort into you, much less to be taught by one of the greatest masters the Empire has ever known and..." Her eyes widened as she took in Roland's panicked expression. "Oh dear. They don't know, do they?"

He shook his head, eyes cast down, as he struggled to get a hold of his breathing.

He'd been wrong. There _was_ something that could be done to him. He could loose the only thing in the world that was truly his. If Rose discovered his ability, he wasn't sure he would survive that. It was his only possession, and she would take it from him and own it.

"Roland."

His name broke him from his panic. She'd never used it before.

"I, Terraria va Belcia, here do swear to never mention your ability to another soul, on pain of my life."

Roland's breath caught. He stared at her, processing her words, trying to believe them. She reached over and took his hand; his heart fluttered.

"I would never destroy someone with a secret so entrusted to me. I will not; you have my word."

Roland took a deep breath, held it, nodded, then let it out slowly. His shoulders relaxed, though a knot of anxiety had made a homestead of his stomach.

She smiled at him. It was nice until she took her hand back, leaving his feeling cold and empty.

"Think on it," she said. "This ability of yours, subtly applied, could be an advantage none could counter, _especially_ if they don't know."

Roland stared down at the puzzle absently. He'd only considered how he could fly — and he _needed_ that — but he hadn't considered using it in a fight. Even attempting to use it on Rose or Master Yeng was impossible — they'd know immediately — and what he'd done to Ven was more instinct than anything intentional.

"You were wise to keep this hidden," Terra continued, "and I can understand why; that Rose woman is not pleasant. But you do need practice..."

He looked up as her voice trailed off. She looked at him with hazel eyes, mostly brown but with a sunburst of green around her pupils. They stood out against smooth skin he could only describe as chocolate. She wore an excited smile and once again his heart found rhythm difficult.

She leaned forward. "I can help you. You can practice on me," she raised a hand, "but no one else. My brother may be dense, but he's not stupid; he would figure it out quick enough. You use your talent to gain the advantage of me; I will try to counteract it. More importantly, I will tell you when I detect it. Over time, you will learn subtlety until even I cannot tell. And if I, someone who knows what you can do, cannot tell you are doing it..."

"...then neither will anyone else," Roland whispered.

Terra stood up suddenly; Roland followed. "We will begin tomorrow." She turned and walked to the door, then stopped with her hand on the handle. She turned back with something like uncertainty on her face.

"I spoke at length with my brother before I came here," she said. "He has rescinded his oath and offers you an apology."

Roland snorted out his disbelief.

"I know my brother can be difficult. He does not always handle well a certain level of dissonance between his expectations and reality, and all to often he lashes out because of it. But he does learn, in time, and in this case I believe he's taken the lesson quite to heart. If you would be willing to overlook his past transgressions, I believe you and he can reach at least a mutual forbearance, if not cordiality?"

Roland stared at her for a long second, then nodded.

Her smile brightened and her eyes danced. "Good. I am so looking forward to this."

And then she was gone.

He stared at the door for a long time.

"Me too..."
