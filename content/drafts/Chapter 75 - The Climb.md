# 75 | The Climb

Roland stared up at the mountains and wondered whether he'd made the right choice. Odd how that familiarity made them grow smaller in his mind over the years. They looked much more substantial from this angle, and he had no way to _pull_ himself up without a forest. The going would be slow, and mistakes measured in hours or even days. He would have to climb the old fashioned way and risk death with every step.

He had known this, of course, which was why he brought the picks, but knowing and seeing were two very different things.

He looked back at the forest behind him and felt naked. All those Whitewoods had been like a security blanket, a source of power he could wrap himself in. But here he was exposed, vulnerable in a way that made his back twitch. There would be no easy way to _pull_ himself out of danger. A fall from the mountain would kill him as easily as the supposed beasts that ruled the place.

Also, he had no idea how to climb a mountain.

He felt like a fool. The forest was his home, not the mountains. He'd tricked himself into thinking he could do this simply because he saw them day in and out. Standing before the base of one made him realize just how unprepared he was. He had rope and picks. Was that how people climbed mountains? It seemed too little.

He should turn back and never, ever mention this to Rose.

Just the thought of her drove his feet forward.

She might never know, but he would, and he would not allow himself to be cowed by her. It was more than pride, it was survival. Beating her was _how_ he survived, and to allow this mountain to defeat him was simply unacceptable. He would defeat this challenge like he had every other — he pulled his eyes away from the peaks — or so he hoped.

He broke into a jog and kept his eyes peeled for tracks. It was unlikely he would find any so far down the mountain, but he was technically on the mountain, and maybe if he spotted the right tracks early, he could avoid too much climbing, though he felt that a stupid hope to hold to.

As the hours passed he was forced to jog less and climb more. He saw plenty of tracks but nothing that resembled something his prey would leave. He tried to follow trails, but they meandered too much and occasionally forced him to turn back after either finding a dead-end or the discovery that the path circled back down the mountain. It was frustrating to lose so much time to so many false illusions of progress, yet he was loath to pull out his picks and start a real climb.

His decision was decided for him when he started a promising trail that seemed to head steeply up the mountain. It was mostly smoothed stone that almost looked manmade, which was absurd of course.

The thought twisted a disquiet in his gut and forced him to a stop. He knelt and examined the path.

A massive footprint set in stone with six toes, maybe?

Nature could make all kinds of shapes, given enough time, right? And this stone was exposed to the wind, so it was possible the wind did this.

He fingered the inside of the print. The stone felt smooth without any of the cracks he might expect from something heavy. It looked more like an imprint in the clay.

Stone didn't compress like clay. It just didn't. So it had to have been worn down. That was the only explanation. The wind had worn it down.

He closed his eyes and nodded to himself. It was the wind, only the wind.

Deep breath, hold, and lookup. Air whistled through his nose.

The wind might make one print from chance, but it certainly did not make a trail of footprints.

The very form of the trail shifted in his mind as he examined the edges, noting the very regular way it had been... carved? No, like the footprints, it looked too smooth to be cut. Formed then and — he sighed — formed very much like clay.

What pressed and formed stone like little more than clay? He had no idea, but he had no intention of messing with whatever could do that.

He immediately detached his picks and started the climb.

His progress slowed down considerably.

Climbing wasn't exactly hard, especially not with his cycle to sustain him, but it was surprisingly tricky. When used properly, the picks would form a pointed wedge that would pulverize the stone, creating a hole just large enough for the pick itself. By releasing the edge, the pick would be wedged in the hole. He quickly discovered that he had to release the edge, or the pick would just pull itself right back out.

Climbing became an almost mind-numbing rhythm of form an edge, strike, release, pull, and repeat.

He repeatedly bounced unpowered picks off the stone, and more than once found himself dangling as a pick he'd forgotten to release pulled out of the hole.

This was how he would die. Not bravely fighting some monster, but with one slip of a pick followed by a long fall. He cursed his stupidity even as he pressed forward.

He continued like this for hours. Occasionally, he would stop on a ledge to look for tracks but rarely found anything and never any that belonged to his prey.

He was still barely a tenth of the way up the mountain before the sky hinted at oranges. It was far too late to head back, which meant a cold night on a mountainside he was vastly unprepared for.

Wow, he really did not plan well for this.

He twisted his head back, but the sun was already low. He'd need shelter soon. Above, the cliff angled outward but perhaps not too much for him, and beyond it a ledge, maybe, he hoped.

Before the sun had touched the horizon, he scrambles over the ledge smiled.

He was at the edge of a large plateau that spanned several times the size of the training ground back home. It even had enough soil to support a few straggly Whitewoods, bushes, some grass, and a small pond in the middle. It was surprisingly picturesque and with no hungry beasts in sight. Luck, it seemed, favored him.

He sat down, grabbed some food from his pack, and enjoyed the expansive view as he ate. While the sun had yet set, it still cast long shadows across the many valleys laid out before him. The striated ice had filled out into a thin layer of clouds that reflected light oranges just above his eye level. The ranges below took the peached light, mixed it with the blood reds of the Whitewoods, and sent the light back out to crest a sea of color that sparkled. It almost made the climb worth it to see such a view.

He finished his dinner as the sun just began to touch the horizon. He rose and turned to find a place to sleep. The trees would provide no shelter, nor the bushes. The pond was oddly tempting, if only for the sense of peace, but what he really needed was—

Footprint.

Lead crept into his limbs, rooted him to the spot, and brought him down. It was the same print as before, yet now stamped into the soil instead of stone. There was no way it was not fresh.

He rose to his feet slowly, looked around, and noticed signs everywhere of the... thing's presence, but of a monster, he saw nothing. He could have days before it came back or only seconds.

He would not go down, he would not retreat, but neither could he stay here. His eyes trailed up. Perhaps he could find some ledge to sleep on.

Disappointment tightened his chest, but he could not stay here.

He jogged toward the back of the plateau, his eyes darting for anything that might look jump out at him. As he approached the cliff, he saw a large boulder butted against the cliff face. Seeing it as an easy way to gain some altitude, he angled toward it. He jumped, but it was a bit too high for him, and he was far too accustomed to _pulling_ to judge a normal jump.

He plunged his pick into the boulder, and then the mountain threw him back off.

His back struck the ground while momentum brought his legs over his head and twisted his neck. He slowly pushed himself to his hands and tried to clear his mind as a rumble assaulted his ears.

He blinked slowly, looked up, and fell back on his butt as every drop of blood fled his face. The boulder unfurled itself, rose up, turned to him, and roared at him the sound of a landslide.

He had found the owner of the stone footprint and embedded his pick into its shoulder.

He scuttled backward from the... rock thing... beast? Troll... Rock, yes! that was it, Rock Troll! For some reason, it seemed absurdly important to have a name for the thing that killed him.

He rolled as it lifted its leg to crush him under a stone foot. The foot missed, but a wall hit him hard enough to send flying through the air with a fair amount of debris. He skipped and skittered across the plateau until he wasn't sure he'd simply fly out off the mountain itself.

He groaned and pushed himself to his knees after he stopped rolling. He glanced back and half-expected to see the cliff edge, but he'd barely been flung halfway across the plateau. He squeezed his eyes shut a moment and forced down a wave of dizziness. It really seemed a lot further when he was in the air.

He got up to his feet slowly, which earned a surprised look on the Rock Troll's face. It seemed it wasn't used to its victims getting up again.

He really didn't want to fight the thing, especially on its home turf, and with no knowledge of its capabilities aside from an incredible stomp. But if he wanted off this mountain, he'd need his pick back, even if he had to cut it out. He slowly reached behind to remove his sword.

The troll's face shifted into a wave of indignant anger at the sight of his sword. It's breathing increased, eyes narrowed, and Roland prepared himself for a fight.

Then it turned and walked away.

He froze and suddenly felt very uncertain about the situation. Had it just dismissed him? He shifted on his feet as it walked toward the back of the plateau. Should he follow it? Attack from behind? He'd have no issues doing that if he were hunting it, but it somehow felt wrong in this situation, dishonorable even.

It pushed its hand into the rock face.

His mouth dropped as he felt an enormous amount of energy flow out of the troll. He barely needed to open his senses to realize that it was shaping a surface inside the stone, something he wouldn't have believed possible.

After a second, it retracted its hand and with it a boulder twice Roland's size. His eyes went big as that same boulder shot out of its hand. It hadn't even needed to throw the thing, just propelled it with the same surface it had used to carve it out.

On instinct, he reached out and _pulled_ on the closest thing that wasn't a Rock Troll. He jerked himself away just in time, but a loud crack arrested his flight, and the ground immediately pummelled him. He maintained just enough awareness to release his _pull_ before he speared himself with the sapling he'd torn from the ground.

He rolled several times before pushing himself to his hands and knees. He glanced back, but there was no sign of the boulder. The Troll had shot it clear off the plateau.

He pushed himself up to his feet and faced the Rock Troll, who looked surprised, again. Was it simply not used to fighting or more probably not accustomed to long altercations? He shook his head of the distraction and ran at it.

It was a stupid thing to do. He knew that. Yet he had no other ideas, and just standing there would ensure as quick a death as any. He distantly hoped that perhaps he could distract it long enough to grab the pick and make a run for it.

Its expression transformed into incredulity, and he was struck with how expressive it was. He wasn't used to his monsters giving him human-like expressions. It was unnerving.

As he got closer, it cocked it's head to the side, smirked — actually smirked — and then stomped its foot. This time he _saw_ the gravic waves spread out from the impact. It looked like the ground rippled the way a pond would after throwing in a large rock. He once again found himself flying back before slamming into the ground and rolling to a stop.

That was surely a broken rib.

He couldn't beat this thing. He couldn't even get close to it. He had nothing with the range that would scratch the armored beast. Give him a year, and maybe he could form a shield strong enough to defend against those boulders it threw... but then maybe not. Maybe his sword would do some damage, but he couldn't get close enough to use it. He briefly entertained the notion of _pulling_ himself to the Troll, but the fantasy ended in the thing punching him out of the air. He discarded that idea with a small shudder.

Then, to his utter horror, the Rock Troll sat down and gazed at him with a placid look.

Roland chocked.

He had never been so summarily dismissed as unimportant in his whole life. He felt his face flush with humiliation. The thing had measured his worth and concluded him to be so harmless that it simply sat down. He tried to glare at it, but it raised a single eye ridge in response, and at that moment, he'd never felt like more like a little boy.

With no other ideas, he pushed himself up and back until he was seated cross-legged.

The two of them watched each other for a time before it, apparently bored and hungry, reached over, grabbed a large rock, and popped it in its mouth. It chewed slowly with a grinding sound that echoed throughout the plateau. He had no idea whether it actually ate rocks or was making a demonstration.

Determined not to be outdone, he grabbed for his pack but found it missing. A brief search found it about a dozen paces away. He didn't want to disturb whatever equilibrium they'd established, so he chose not to get up. But he did take a minute to form a surface enough to drag it back to him. The Troll grunted in amusement as the bag slid across the ground. He reached in and grabbed some jerky to chew on while they stared at each other.

As interesting as the Rock troll was, his eyes wandered around the plateau for a bit. It really was nice, aside from the Whitewood he pulled free, which really shouldn't have happened. He narrowed his eyes at it. It felt weaker, thinner. The Whitewoods must not do well this high up, which begged the question as to why it was growing here in the first place. He looked around more and realized that most of the fauna here wasn't really suited to the mountains. They shouldn't be surviving unless — he snapped his eyes back to the Troll in surprise — someone had been caring for them.

He studied the plateau again but now with a different perspective. Everything here had been carefully chosen, planted, and cared for. There was even an aesthetic to it, which he had to admit was appealing. Now that he saw, it _looked_ manmade, he just hadn't expected it.

Expectation had ever been the enemy of the truth. He'd blinded himself to clues that were now glaringly obvious. He'd practically invaded the Troll's home. No wonder it had been mad.

What he saw now was not a raging, homicidal beast. It was a caretaker and one with little interest in fighting, no matter how well it could defend itself. Had it truly wanted him dead... well, he could think of a dozen ways it could have done that, and several of them involved an uncontrolled flight off the mountain.

He came upon a sudden appreciation for passivity in powerful creatures.

He then came up with an absurdly stupid idea. Instead of fighting the creature, he would simply ask it for what he needed, if that were even possible. Something told him it very well might be.

He stuffed his remaining jerky into his pack and carefully replaced his sword on his back, which was tricky to do under his coat while sitting, but he didn't want to risk further animosity by standing back up with a weapon. That accomplished, he stood slowly while the troll regarded him with mild curiosity.

His pick was harder to find as it had been thrown clear in the Troll's initial attack. In the end, he was forced to use his senses to find it wedged under a small, well-pruned bush. He _pulled_ it back to himself, replaced it on his pack, and walked carefully toward the Troll with hands out in what he hoped it would take as a peaceful gesture.

As he approached, it stood up slowly, almost languidly.

With a slow movement, he retrieved his remaining pick and showed it to the troll. Then he pointed at its back. The troll initially looked confused before it stretched its head around to glance backward. It then snapped its attention back at Roland in surprise.

He stumbled back a little as a low rhythmic rumbling came from the Troll and mentally prepared himself for another fight. But the beast wasn't tensing for battle, it was laughing, or perhaps chuckling.

It reached back, carefully removed the pick, and threw it his feet. He then held the picks up and gestured at the cliff face. The troll glanced back and forth between the picks and the cliff, and then its eyes went wide as it grasped his meaning. The rumbling in its belly grew to a crescendo that forced him to take several steps back.

The Troll threw its hand back casually at the cliff in apparent dismissal. It then walked by him without another glance and gently picked up the displaced Whitewood. He watched it walk it over to the hole and begin a meticulous process of re-planting the tree. It was such an odd sight he couldn't help but watch for a time. He might have watched the entire process except the sun had almost vacated the sky, and he still needed a place to sleep. No matter how passive the Troll appeared, he would get no sleep here where a single misplaced or careless step might be the end of him.

He quietly walked over to the cliff face and began a painful climb up the cliff face. His ribs and shoulder hurt most, though he didn't recall how he'd injured his shoulder. After another hour of climbing, he found a decent-sized ledge he could sleep on, though it offered little shelter from the wind. It was certainly no wooded plateau, but the sun had long ago set, leaving little more than an orange afterglow in the sky. As the stars made their debut for the night, he worked the painful process of pushing his cycle into his wounds to heal them.

He then turned his attention to more pressing matters. Sleeping on the side of a mountain was going to be an icy affair. He had insufficient clothing, no source of heat, and he was exposed to a howling wind that appeared to have no intention of letting up. The biggest problem was the wind, which drove the cold into him. He needed some kind of protection, but there was nothing around him he could use.

He grabbed some jerky from his pack and settled back against the cliff face as he turned the problem over in his head. Already the temperature plummeted with no sign of the wind letting up. Well, if he froze to death, at least he would die looking out at a beautiful landscape. That was something, at least.

After finishing his dinner, he arranged his pack to use as a pillow. It wasn't a good pillow, and he fiddled with it repeatedly, removing or replacing items to try to get it into some serviceable pillow-like form.

He started to shiver as soon as he laid down. He sat back up and scowled. This was not going to work. He needed some kind of shield for the wind... oh, right.

For the next hour, he played around with surfaces until he got a shield in just the right place that it blocked most of the wind and didn't take too much of his attention to keep it in place. Satisfied, he laid his head back on his pack.
