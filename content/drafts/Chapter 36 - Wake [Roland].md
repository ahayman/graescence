# 36 | Wake [Roland]

The wind lashed glass with whips of rain, the sound of it chasing away a fading thunder. Light flashed, followed by a distant echo barely audible beneath the wind's scream.

Roland sat up, confused, sweat drenched, on a bed soaked with damp sheets clumped at the end.

He couldn't recall sitting. He couldn't recall anything.

For a moment, his mind stitched a narrative of him safe at home, the storm almost a comfort as it railed against the house. Father and mother would be down the hall. They had to be, but he couldn't remember why. It was important. He was home. They were—

Lightning flashed again and cast a divided from a paned window into a large room. It lit up the lie he'd told himself.

This was not his home.

The room was too large with two doors instead of one. The sheets were silky; the bed also too large, too soft, and it was posted.

His pupils expanded to bring in more light and detail. A glossy dresser sat beneath the window, barely reflecting a scattered grey of a storm darkened day. And day it was, not night, but only barely. On the opposite wall was a small desk, barely visible, and a half pushed-in chair caught at an angle.

He tried to draw memory, anything that would explain this place and his presence in it, but his attempts pressed against a thick black fog. He pressed in until a ringing sounded in his head and a single word rose with it.

Smoke.

His heart began to race, palms perspired, and a ringing sounded again in his ears. Images flashed in his mind, a town burned, laughing taunts— more pain assaulted his head; the ringing became intense.

He gasped and brought a hand to his head. It took several minutes to slow his breath and push down the panic. As he did, he began to recognize his own body. His arm and shoulder throbbed, he was feverish, his tongue was dry, his mouth pasty. But otherwise, he was whole and some distant part of his mind felt surprise at that.

Lightning flashed an intense sharpness into the room, quickly followed by a loud crack, then a rolling, echoing thunder. A glass filled with water caught the light and scattered it, drawing his eye like a predator to its prey.

He slowly swung his feet around, dropped to the floor, and then collapsed. He grabbed at the bed's under-sheets and managed back to his feet. A couple shaky steps brought him to the water.

He drank the entire glass in one go, then grimaced at a bitter after-taste. His stomach felt too full, but already he felt better, a little clearer, if no less baffled.

He scanned the room again, taking in the oddly rich-looking furniture. He took a step back and stared at the dresser. It had no handles. It clearly had drawers, and they were ornately inlaid with a darker colored wood, but they were flush with the frame and snug. He wasn't sure he could even get his finger nails between the gaps to pry it open. He stared at it until he realized an obvious, incredible truth. The inlays weren't just decorative, they were gravtech.

He place his fingers on the inlay and pushed a small stream of energy until he felt resistance, barely more than a trickle. The drawer slid open to reveal shirts laid neatly in two stacked squares.

His mouth dropped. Gravtech wasn't exactly rare in Larstead, but it was expensive. And while his home had a lights, a heater, and a stove, they were almost as expensive as the entire house. Using gravtech for something so mundane as a drawer was nothing less than obscene.

"The water will help your head, but you need to eat."

Roland spun and took an involuntary step back against the drawer, which closed and left him stumbling back.

A woman with silver hair stood in front of the door opposite him. A blue-tinted light poured in from the hall, catching her hair and turning it into a silky halo. She reached over and placed her hand on the room's panel; a light recessed into the ceiling began to glow.

She wore loose, black pants, with a red shimmering shirt. She was tall and pale with sharp features that accented an ageless beauty. She looked young, but Roland couldn't convince himself it was true. She stood poised in every sense, regal in her bearing, yet balanced as a predator on the cusp of attack.

Then she smiled an genuine, motherly thing. "How are you feeling?"

His brown drew down. "Where am I?"

"This is your new home."

He blinked. "You... kidnapped me?" That made no sense. Why would a rich person kidnap a dirty boy?

"No." She pressed her lips together. "What do you remember?"

"About what?"

Her eyes narrowed. "What's your name?"

"Roland."

"Good, and where are you from, Roland?"

"You kidnapped me, you should know."

The edges of her eyes pinched. "Answer the question."

"Fine." He shook his head and pressed into the black fog of his mind. "I'm from... from..."

His hand had clenched into fists, his heart raced, and that sound in his ears rang again.

A smile touched her lips. "You clearly remember something. Tell me what you can."

He clenched his eyes shut. "Fire, smoke, soldiers and... and..." his father's stubborn face, his mother's horror, a hole in each of them. He gasped and fell to his knees, breath rapid and uneven. He pushed against the memory, against the pain itself. More images assaulted him but they made little sense; the ringing hurt his ears, drilled into his head.

He _pushed_ the pain away.

Fingers wrapped around his jaw and pulled his head up to meet the woman's eyes. His breath caught. The world had bent around him except for her, who stood unaffected in a clear pocket of space, the edges of which curved the distortion back on itself. It was dizzying the way light curled around them.

She was bent over him, cold iron fingers clenched his jaw, her other hand behind her back, her face imperious. Lightning flashed and revealed ice-blue eyes, clear, intense, and empty. In those eyes, he felt insignificant, a thing, a curiosity at most, property but never a person. In her eyes he saw death.

He let go of the world and it snapped back with a loud crack that filled the room.

She let go of his jaw and shifted her demeanor to pleasant so perfectly that he wondered whether he imagined his prior terror.

"You will be very tired," she said as she straightened herself, then her shirt, "but you should eat first." She turned, walked to the door, and turned back to him. "The kitchen is to your left, down the stairs. You will come down in ten minutes."

"Wait," he said before she could leave, "what happened?"

She raised an eyebrow. "To what?"

"Me... My..." he tried to say the name but the ringing pressed in, "town."

"Your town is gone, Roland. This is your home now." She walked out before he could reply.

Gone? He mouthed the word. It made no sense. Had the soldiers burnt everything down? Just the thought increased the ringing in his ears, forcing him to close his eyes while he tried to push down a panic that had clawed into his throat.

He spun and slammed his fist into the dresser. He pushed into the black fog of his mind, pushed until the pain reached a crescendo; his throat closed, he began to sweat, and suddenly he was bent over the dresser, gasping for air.

He let up, irritated that something so simple as memory defied him.

A thin crack ran along the top of the dresser. He fingered it while he waited for the pain to subside. It hadn't been there before. He pressed down on it, but the wood didn't flex. He slammed his fist down on the crack, but managed nothing more than sound. It was a sturdy dresser.

He took a step back, head cocked. Had he done that?

All the drawers opened fine despite the damage. They contained nothing special, just clothes, mostly in browns and creams, but they were all well made and, upon inspection, were all his size.

Maybe she had a son his size? No, that rang false. The clothes were new and felt crisp; she'd only just bought them, and that meant she'd bought them for him.

He chewed on his cheek and stared out the window while he tried to figure out what that meant.

The rain poured and was periodically slammed into the window. Beyond he could see the faint outline of two other buildings. He'd have thought they might be homes but they faced inward, forming a courtyard, and they seemed far too large for a home. Between them trees whipped about and bent to the storm's fury. Beyond those trees he saw, or perhaps felt, trees that did not bow to the storm at all. Whitewoods. He could almost point them out...

He shook off the feeling; enough with the crazy.

He turned and walked through the smaller door; it opened into darkness broken by the glint of steely reflections. On habit, he reached over and groped, then pushed energy into a small panel next to the door frame. The room lit up in a blue-white light to reveal a bathroom.

Roland stared at it in wonder. It had a separate wash basin, a tub over which hung some unfamiliar apparatus with holes in it, and a toilet. He immediately looked around for another door; it couldn't just be his, could it? That would be ridiculous.

He looked around for another door and sure enough, he found one right next to him. He opened it, half expecting to find another room or perhaps a hallway. Instead, he found a closet.

He looked around and belatedly realized it must be his closet. Obvious, given it attached to his bathroom, but he'd never had a closet before. The idea was foreign and ridiculous. He knew no one who had so many clothes they needed a separate room for them all.

And there were a lot of cloths, though very little variation between them. All were in shades of brown, with long runs of the same long-sleeved shirt and darker brown pants. Underneath, were several pairs of boots.

Unease crept into his chest. It was more than he'd ever owned, and he suddenly felt out of place, like the real owner would walk in and demand someone throw out this dirty boy spoiling their clean room.

His stomach gurgled out an angry sound. Had it been ten minutes? Did he even care? He didn't have Sal's sense of time but he was hungry and...

Dammit. Sal. His unease evaporated as guilt flooded in. He'd left his friend for dead, in the woods, injured. He should have tried harder to save him. He should have dragged—

He jerked his head to the side, jaw clenched. It was stupid. There was no way he could have dragged Sal up; he'd barely climbed out himself. But he should have done more.

He blinked away the guilt. Then he blinked away a wave of fatigue at the same time a whiff of something wonderful caught his nose.

Food. He should eat. Eating sounded incredible. Oh gods, he was so hungry. How has he not known this?

Roland walked out with a dazed look. He stopped in the hallway at a heavy scent of spices that filled the air. It both roused his hunger and turned his stomach. Had she thrown the whole spice drawer in the pot?

He walked down the stairs, hand on the rail to steady himself, and out into a large kitchen. At this point, he wasn't surprised. The lady was clearly rich. What did surprise him was to see her cooking; he'd expected her to have servants or something.

Or maybe that's why he was here, to be her servant? He snickered; gods would she be disappointed.

He walked over to a table on the far edge of kitchen. The surface of the table was rough, unfinished, but lacquered, as though the craftsman had become hurried or bored or just decided to damn it all to hell and throw on a coat of lacquer. It was smooth though and with the lacquer filling the gaps it made for a perfectly suitable table. So perhaps it was intentional, and then this lady bought it because... because she was rich. Right. Rich people bought weird things.

He sat down and watched her work. It was mesmerizing. He'd never considered that cooking could be graceful, yet every move she made was exactly that. She never stayed in place for long, sprinkling something into pot, moving on to push energy into a handle, then on to check something simmering in a pan. It was a dance of motion that suggest many years of practice and love.

He couldn't have said how long he been staring when she finished. She showed no sign of surprise to see him sitting there. She simply walked over, put his plate down, and then her own. She sat, gestured lightly to his plate, grabbed a silver fork and knife — real silver, not tin, not polished whatever — and cut off a piece of chicken.

On his plate was half a roasted bird, edges crisped, with a plum colored sauce drizzled over it. Next to it was rice with green chives, a slice of lemon on top, and beside it vegetables that looked roasted. Everything was spiced, everything, so different from the merely salted fare he'd grown up with.

"Eat," she said and gave him a gentle smile.

He narrowed his eyes at her; he did not trust her smile. But then, she wasn't looking anyway.

He took at first a tentative bite. Then followed it with a second. Before he'd swallowed, he was shoving another fork full into his mouth. Even the vegetables, something he normally avoided, were better than anything he'd had before. He may have grunted, or even moaned. He wasn't sure.

He finished and only then looked up. The woman had barely eaten a third of her meal. She didn't look at him or show any sign of distaste, but he suddenly felt as though he'd been some animal ravaging though a rich woman's feast. His stomach hurt, his head felt woolen, and still his tongue demanded more.

She ate as though he wasn't there. He considered asking for more but the idea of speaking felt like an insult. So he waited while the questions pounded against his teeth. This lasted all of about a minute before his biggest question somehow pushed its way through is lips.

"What's your name?"

She finished chewing her bite, washed it down with wine, and smiled.

"My name is Rose." She tilted her head in a small nod, then gestured to his half-glass of untouched wine. "Drink," she said, "it'll help you sleep."

He gave the wine a skeptical look — alcohol wasn't normally allowed him — but he decided that offending Rose may not be a good idea, so he he sipped the beverage. He almost chocked on the stuff, earning a good-natured smile from her.

"I think it's bad," he said and pushed it away.

"I assure you it's not, but I suppose it can be an acquired taste."

Roland blinked at her. One didn't acquire taste, it just was; it was a thing your tongue told you was good or bad. The chicken for instance was good, even the vegetables were good, but that wine tasted like someone had soured perfectly good juice. He opened his mouth to say exactly that.

"Finish the wine." Her voice carried a dangerous edge.

His mouth snapped closed. He narrowed his eyes at the glass, pinched his lips, and with deliberate motion, pushed it just a little further away.

"Finish. the. wine."

She had stopped eating, knife in one hand, fork in the other with a piece of chicken on it, both posed just above the table. Her eyes had lost their warmth, replaced with a cold calculating edge, and once again he felt as though he were a thing for her to take apart. He suddenly did not want to be taken apart.

Roland clenched his jaw and pulled the glass over. As he did, it caught, tipped, and spilled. He jumped up before the liquid could reach him and stared at it, eyes wide.

It occurred to him that his parents never drank wine for one important reason: it was absurdly expensive.

Rose slowly rose the fork to her mouth, pulled the chicken off with her lips, and chewed. The wine crept toward the edge, then slowly dripped onto the floor. Roland fidgeted on his feet, unsure of where this was going. His father would have smirked while his mother huffed; a towel would have been thrown at him with stern, exasperated words. None of that happened and it was unnerving.

Rose simply sat there eating while the wine dripped. After the third bite, Roland wanted to beg her to yell at him, but a sudden, irrational fear had sewn his mouth closed. She ate and the puddle on the floor grew.

Her chair scratched when she stood, drawing his eyes up from the puddle. She walked back to the kitchen, and shortly returned with a bottle and a towel. She righted the glass and filled it to precisely its prior level. She placed the towel on Roland's side of the table, still folded neatly, then she sat back down and sawed at the chicken on her plate.

Roland slowly reached over, took the towel, knelt and wiped up the wine on the floor. Then he wiped up the wine on the table. This left behind a sticky residue; he glanced at Rose but she only continued to eat. After some hesitation, he walked the rag to the kitchen, rinsed it out, walked back to the table and cleaned up the sticky from both the floor and table.

His mother would have abhorred how easily this woman had gotten him to clean with not even a single word spoken.

Roland sat down, considered the wine for a moment, then downed the entire glass in three large gulps, intending to swallow it all before the taste reached his brain. He squeezed his eyes against the sour and worked his tongue as his body shuddered from the aftertaste.

When he opened his eyes, she was staring at him in shock, mouth slightly ajar.

_That_ got a reaction? "What? You told me to finish. the. wine. So I did."

She closed her eyes, released a slow breath through her nose, and schooled her face back to neutral. She took another bite.

That was it? He stared at her and released a slow breath through his nose. She paid him no mind. He switched tactics, and tapped lightly on the table. Nothing. He played with the glass, she ate. He pushed his thumb under the plate, raised it, and let it drop but the storm chose that moment to express its fury in a thunderous applause.

He waited for it to die down. Perhaps she hadn't heard.

He pushed his thumb under the plate and rose it even more than before. The silverware rattled when he dropped it. She didn't even blink.

He pinched his lips. "Why did you kidnap me?"

Once again, she didn't answer immediately, but finished her bite, sipped from her wine, and looked up at him. Her eyes narrowed and again he got the impression she was deciding how to take him apart, but instead of feeling fear, he just felt annoyed at her mind games. He met her eyes and flattened his expression.

"Do you know what you are?"

He blinked. "I ah... yes? I'm a boy." He gave her a firm nod, with perhaps only a hint of sarcasm.

Her lips compressed into a tight smile. "Yes, but that's not all. You are also what some call a godling."

"A what?"

She showed surprise for the second time. "You've not heard the term?"

He shook his head slowly.

"No bedtimes stories; no tales among your peers; no fireside chronicles of godlings come to destroy your village?"

Roland pinched his brow and narrowed his eyes. He did not come from a village.

"That is... unexpected."

"Okay—"

"What stories were told then?" she said as she leaned forward and templed her fingers.

Roland shrugged again. The conversation had become decidedly odd.

"Come now. Surely a boy your age traded stories with your peers, of monsters, scary things in the night?"

No. Not really. Roland mostly just went on adventures, and though there was admittedly a lot of monster slaying involved — too much according to Sal — he wouldn't call them scary, not really.

Although... "We don't go beyond the line; we don't play with the Whitewoods."

Roland could hear his mother's voice echoed within his own; he flinched as sorrow washed over him; then came the ring—

"Whitewoods? What are those?"

What? How could she not know? "They are trees. They're white."

She released a slow breath through her nose; her eyes went flat. Roland fidgeted for a second before rolling his eyes and letting out a small huff.

"They're dangerous; they don't bend. There's even a rhyme but I think it's stupid."

"Tell me."

He recited it with a flat, tired tone. "Blooded in winter, verdant in spring, bleached bones in between." So stupid. He was pretty sure they just smashed blood and bones in there just to scare little kids.

"Ah. And the line?"

"It's just... the line. You don't go past it."

"Why?"

He twisted his brow in exasperation. "Because those who do never come back. Ever."

"Ever?"

"Besides, it hums."

She cocked her head. "The line... hums..."

"Mm hmm. You can feel it the closer you get."

Although Sal claimed it was just a pressure. To Roland it had been an intense humming throughout his body that increased the closer he got to it. He wasn't even sure he _could_ have crossed it even if he'd wanted to, which he didn't... or, not anymore at least, not since they'd tried. It was a memory he'd rather forget. The Whitewoods were one thing, they were just dangerous and that was fun, but crossing the line was downright suicidal.

"What's beyond the line?"

"More Whitewoods, I guess. Monsters maybe? I dunno."

"It was close enough," she half said to herself in thought before returning her attention a few seconds later. "And you said soldiers attacked your village?"

He frowned; his eyes darted in thought. "You had to have been there..." but that wasn't right. Why would a rich lady be with soldiers? Unless she came after? But after what? His memory had holes.

"No, you kidnapped me," he said after a few seconds. "You should know."

He waited, expecting some kind of explanation, but after a couple minutes, she simply retrieved her silverware from where she'd placed them neatly beside her plate, speared the last piece of her bird, and chewed silently.

"What are godlings?" he asked, his voice strained with frustration. So far, he'd answered a lot of her questions and got nothing more than more questions in return.

She washed the last piece of her chicken down with the last of her wine.

"Godlings are stories told to wayward children to frighten them; they are monsters hunted by the Empire; they are feared and reviled and slaughtered like animals wherever they're found. They're a blight on all society and better off dead for the sake of everyone else."

As she spoke, a snake slithered through his stomach, slowly working its way up until it wrapped itself around his heart.

Why was he here?

She leaned over with a light in her eyes. "But godlings are also people with great power. True godlings can destroy armies and cities with a power most cannot even fathom. A godling can reshape an Empire," she leaned back and paused, "with proper training, of course."

The snake squeezed; his town, something about his— ringing slammed into his head. He closed his eyes against the pain and lowered his head into his hands.

"Is that what happened upstairs?" he said after the pain had let up some.

"No, that was nothing but a simple field warp."

"A what?"

"The same energy you use to turn on a light or heat a hot plate can be expressed into the world without the need for tech. A field warp is an undirected expression of that energy. Generating one is the basic minimum needed to become a shielder or a shaper."

A shielder? He could be a— wait no! He could be a _shaper_? No, that couldn't be right. They were practically myth. Might as well claim he could fly.

"I have no intention of killing you, of course, but I will train you to use that power."

Roland looked up through his fingers, which now held his head by his fingertips. The world had become watery; he tried to blink it away but that brought on a wave of exhaustion.

"Training?"

"Begins tomorrow."

"Training for what?"

She smiled at him and he decided then that he would never like her smile. She stood up and picked up her plate.

"Come on! What training?" A shielder? Maybe? Or... gods, it was stupid, but a shaper? Such a stupid idea, and yet he couldn't keep a bright young hope from blossoming in his stomach.

Rose placed her silverware on the plate, grabbed her empty wine glass, and headed back into the kitchen. He quickly gathered his own and scrambled after her, repeating his question. He gave up after about half a dozen attempts to rephrase the same question. She only spoke once more that night.

"Get sleep. You'll need it."

He doubted that was possible with his mind spinning with so many questions. But that night, just before sleep drug him under with its merciless pull, all of those questions died out with a single resounding hope: maybe, just maybe, he could be a champion, a real one.
