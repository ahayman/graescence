# 54 | Abandoned [Terra]

Terraria va Belcia was having a bad hair day, and week, and month. It was a slow descent into hell, as each day she could see the wild curls regain just a little more of their form, slowly taking over her head.

She had run out of supplies just over a month ago. Every day since had been a careful balancing act between washing her hair, which would invite back the curls with vengeance, and allowing it to collect dust and sweat from each day's exertion, of which there was an abundance of both in this place. Part of her wanted to scoff at the ridiculousness of caring so over a trivial matter. The other part of her did scoff, because it did matter, a lot. Polite society suffered no curls, or not her curls at least. Some of the lighter skinned Royals would indeed play with threaded spirals, tastefully arranged in neat coils to frame the face. But her? No. She was of purer stock and thus required straight silky hair no matter the cost. Society would allow nothing less for one of her breeding.

It should not have been a problem. The caustic oils and creams designed to tame her hair were plentiful and varied. Even as she and her brother travelled between the schools of art, finding supplies had required barely more effort than an inquiry— often just asking would result in a variety of options delivered to her room. While she did carry extra supplies, it was more a function of her desire to always be prepared than for any true need. The whole of the Empire was stocked brim full of the stuff...

Except here.

Terra stared into a small mirror and scowled at her hair as the curls pushed it beyond the mirror's reflection. She smoothed her face and reached for a comb, hand crafted from the ivory of some animal that roamed the Santonian plains, probably expensive if she'd thought to check. She brought the comb to her hair, but reconsidered and set it back down. It would only make things worse at this point. Instead, she grabbed a few small ties and began corralling her hair into a tightly bound tail behind her head.

It would have to do, even though it very much didn't. Showing her face in public like this would be an utter catastrophe, one to be avoided at all costs. Yet it was also one she had no way to avoid. Today, they were going home, finally, and she was dreading it.

She'd failed, and if that weren't worse, she _looked_ like she failed. It was odd, in a way. Had she arrived looking radiant, no one but her mother and herself would know of her failure— and of course she would tell mother; it wouldn't occur to her to do otherwise. Well, and perhaps her brother would know were he paying attention, or cared. He didn't, but then he hardly mattered. Her failure cut deep and looking the part only rubbed salt on the wound.

The worst part of it all was how she failed, in that she didn't know. She couldn't figure it out. She would have sworn she had the boy pegged; she would have sworn he was a find like no other. So she'd made every effort to befriend him, even to use her brother as a kind of counter weight, pushing him toward her. And it worked, quickly even— the boy was clearly lonely. He'd even told her his 'secret', something he'd been careful to hide from his own Lady, though no doubt the insufferable woman knew already. One did not put so much effort into someone unless they were special.

Then the boy had run away and shown his character as flawed with a kind of breathtaking finality. It was cowardice, pure and simple, but even that was something Terra was quite willing to forgive. She'd seen just how brutal the boy's training was, and that combined with isolation could easily wear down the most stalwart, much less a peasant without training. No doubt he'd even convinced himself that running into the forest was the brave, rational thing to do. She would have sworn he had an iron core, though, and given both training _and_ support, his loyalty could be earned absolute. Sheltered beneath the Chair of Belcia, he would grow fearsome and unbeatable, a worthy asset she would be proud to present to mother.

Instead, he lied.

Worse, he doubled down on it. She given him outs, made it obvious she knew he was lying, if only that he might see his error. Yet he compounded lies with tales so fanciful that it strained the imagination.

Cowardice can be cured and liars can be managed, but fools? That is one character flaw too risky to assume.

That left her with only one option, as unsavory as it was. And here it was that her failure became complete, for she would not kill the boy. He _was_ too dangerous to leave in another's hands, yet she'd grown fond of him. He had a kind of playful earnestness that was disarming. And perhaps that wasn't enough to stay her hand, but... she had doubts. There were pieces of the puzzle that didn't add up, things she could not fully explain. His weapon, for one; the wounds, for another. Although she'd begun to doubt they were as serious as they'd first appeared. He'd been on his feet barely a week later, belying the actual severity of his injuries.

It was enough, though, that Terraria va Belcia found herself oddly unable to commit to an action. It was a forgivable failing; she was still young. So her best option was to lay it out before mother and learn from someone more experienced. The rest would be handled. Mother would bring to bear far more resources than Terra had access to, assess the boy, and... likely Roland would be eliminated.

It would be a relief. Terra was not much inclined to darker aspects of a Royal's responsibility. She'd always been better at making friends, and allowing them to handle the unsavory. It was an allowable weakness, if only because she was quite adept in her ability to disarm and persuade. People trusted her and, for the most part, they were right to. She rarely betrayed trust, and never without proper reason.

A quiet knock on the door drew her out of her thoughts. She pivoted on the stool, turning toward the door, and took a moment to comport herself.

"You may enter."

Ashter walked in wearing the same clothes he'd worn their first day here, the wraps tightly done. It was a style specific to the martial artists of their province, though his shroud was not. That belonged to the merchants. That he had tastefully combined them spoke well of of him.

He bowed at the waist.

Terra smiled, pleased. "You have given my offer consideration."

"I have," he rose, but his face was troubled.

"You have concerns."

"Your brother seems to have become preoccupied of late."

Terra suppressed a scowl beneath her smile. Ven was not preoccupied, he was obsessed.

"He is concerned, yes. The nature of this place eludes him."

"As it does us all."

Terra's smile slipped at Ashter's subtext. She spoke slowly. "Surely, you must agree his concern is not misplaced."

"His concern, no. But his enthusiasm?"

She was going to loose yet another to the damnable antics of her brother, again. She decided to shift the conversation.

"Enthusiasm has it's place, if directed."

Ashter wasn't having any of it. "He is then truly Van?"

Terra's brow shot up, shocked that the youth before her would utter such words. It was an inappropriate question, dangerous even. Ven would be entirely in his rights to slay Ashter on the spot, yet Ven wasn't here; Terra was. It almost threw her, until she remembered who she was talking to. Ashter's family was a power among the merchants— they'd have to be to send their son to so expensive a school. Yet it was easy to forget that the quiet unassuming youth before her would have been thoroughly trained in the art of negotiation. And so Ashter was no fool; he knew his demeanor and it's affect; he knew it was it's own way to disarm; and he knew when to break out of it to get what he wanted.

Her opinion of him shot up.

She spoke her words precisely. "He is, yes... at present."

Ashter watched her. A Van would persist for only so long as they held their place, and such a precarious position suffered no fool for long. Even Chairs can be brought down by their own foolishness, even if it were a rare event. When it did happen, though, the collateral fallout would take out any aligned.

He dipped his head. "I will send to the patriarchs your regard, the matriarchs your love."

She tilted her head. "And to the chair I will speak your deeds."

Ashter presented a polite smile, turned, and left without another word. Terra sighed in relief after he'd left. It was a small victory, but a good one. Terra had begun the overtures a couple months ago. What followed was a careful dance of words and deeds. Each watched the other closely, judging and evaluating. Questions were answered and assurances were made, slowly fomenting a possible relationship. Nothing was certain. The ultimate decision would be left to her Chair and the consensus of his... archs— a foreign arrangement whereby his house was ruled both by the patriachs and matriachs, requiring consensus for any major decisions. Terra would fully admit she didn't understand it, but Ashter's house was large and would be a valuable ally.

And yet the overtures had been sabotaged endlessly. She would have sworn her fool of a brother had done it on purpose, if she could be convinced he'd actually known what she was doing. Her brother seemed to delight in breaching etiquette and serving insult to those around him.

The thought of his flashed boiled her anger. "That _fool_ is going to loose his head."

The whole point of their tour was to introduce _discipline_. It had taken Terra enormous effort to arrange it all, from convincing mother _not_ to forcibly remove Ven from the line of succession, to tricking Ven into both believing it was his idea, and that he managed to do so out of mother's reach. Getting them in the tour itself was not hard— they were quite skilled. Both she and mother had agreed— hoped —that the experience would temper him.

And that was Terra's final, and perhaps greatest failure. Ven was skilled, _too skilled_, and in the stead of temperance arrogance grew unrestrained. Ven somehow managed to get even worse, if that were possible. His actions were no longer of a Belcia. His mind was... well, if his latest obsession was any indication, his mind was not stable.

And so, he was, quite possibly, living out his final days here. Unless he was far more intelligent than she'd credited him, mother would remove him shortly after returning.

And there was nothing Terra could do about it. This was her last gambit, her final effort to keep her only remaining brother alive.

She closed her eyes and allowed a moment of weakness. She allowed the frustration and sorrow to wash over her, waves of grief for a fool that had vexed her to no end. Yet she loved him.

Yes, she loved him, but even love could not keep fools from loosing their head.

Terra Va Belcia would soon be Van. It was only a matter of time now, days or weeks at most. Then, in some distant future, she would become chair, she would become mother. She would bear children, of course, and be forced to judge whether or not they were worthy of life, just as her mother had, and would again.

She turned back to her small mirror and dabbed the wet from her eyes, erasing any evidence of her weakness.

This was not the life she had hoped for.

---

"She will not let us go."

Terra stared at her brother, barely processing his words while she blinked in shock at her brother's room. The idiot hadn't even started packing. He was instead laying on his bed, sheets pushed to the end by his feet, while idly reading a book that— she blinked slowly —was not his?

When did he visit that woman's library? Did he even ask?

And he was still in his nightwear. Her hands bawled into fists at her side.

"Why aren't you packed?"

"Did you not hear me?"

She turned on him one of her more potent glares, one reserved for private, one that allowed just enough of her fury to be known.

"Pack."

"I tell you, dear sister—"

"Do not 'dear sister' me," she hissed through her teeth, "we are to leave within the hour."

"—she will not allow us to leave."

"Pack."

"How am I the only one to see this?"

"_Pack._"

He waved the book. "You should consider reading this. It is quite a titillating and, I daresay, illicit version of our beloved Empire's history."

Terra closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened them, her voice was cold.

"You _will_ pack now, and then we _will_ leave. We _will_ return home and you _will_ comport yourself with all the decorum proper to your station."

"Yes, yes," Ven sighed and shook his head, waving his hand, "let us be away then."

She waited, but he didn't move. She begun to tap on the floor with her foot a slow, deliberate rhythm.

He glanced up. "Almost done with the chapter, dear sister. No need for dramatics."

She was barely a moment from showing him exactly what dramatics she could produce, preferably at the end of a knife, when he snapped the book close. She jumped, startled at the sudden motion, then felt heat rise into her face.

He rose, stretched, yawned theatrically, and shot her a boyish grin. She returned to him a face of ice.

Terra stayed only long enough to watch him casually toss a few shirts into his bag before she couldn't stand it anymore— he was just stuffing them in without any regard to their state, without respect, without...

She walked out, closed the door quietly, closed her eyes, and leaned against the door. She stood still for several seconds, so furious she could barely breath.

She opened them at the click of another door. Ashter was leaving his room, two bags in hand. He paused at the sight of her, then dipped his head respectfully.

She returned the gesture and felt some semblance of sanity return to the world. That, at least, had gone well. Ashter's family would make an excellent alliance with the Belcia Chair, especially if Ashter were a good representation of their mettle. He'd shown admirable restraint. It was something she could be proud to present to her mother.

It was the only thing she could present to her mother.

But one did not dwell on one's failures unless one wanted to be a failure. And a failure Terraria va Belcia was not.

She returned to her room and carefully placed a diamond brooch in her hair, arranged to draw attention away from the tail she'd bound up and wrapped into a spiral. She donned her coat and, finally feeling like a proper lady, she glanced around her room, an austere square box not worthy of her personage.

It was an obvious slight, and she had born it as one worthy of her name. She would not miss it.

She grabbed her two bags, brass-gilded, leather wrapped hard-cases made of poplar and secured by graetech locks, expensive stuff and impossible to break into. She took a deep breath. All the family drama aside, she missed home and she was eager to set this whole farce behind her. She just had to make it through the day.

Master Yeng was already in the courtyard quietly talking to Ashter, who nodded along. Likely, some last minute tips or techniques; perhaps an evaluation? Terra stared only long enough to discern their attitudes, then averted her gaze.

Her eyes trailed over the house, the courtyard, the library. She would not miss it, but she could still appreciate it for what it was, or perhaps, what it could be. The three buildings, though sparse for a school, could easily be repurposed. The library would stay as it is, for entertainment. The bunks would house servants. The house, though simple, was yet sufficient for a retreat. She could imagine it as such, a place to fall back to without the noise of the world to intrude. A place to recharge. Her chair had several such places, though perhaps none quite so remote as here... wherever here was.

"Terraria va Belcia, it has been my extreme honor and pleasure to impart such instruction as I could these past months. You have been a student exemplar, bar none."

Terra turned to Master Yeng with a smile.

"The honor is quite mine, I'm afraid," she deflected, "as I have learned more from you than I could hope from even a top tier school."

Master Yeng smiled and offered a shallow bow. "You flatter, for the skill of learning is with the student, and so your progress is your own."

Terra returned a nod. For a brief moment, her eyes flittered over the distant mountain ranges visible just above the tree line. She swallowed the very question that had driven her brother into obsession.

Because, in the end, they _would_ find out. Her mother would make it an absolute certainty. Why her fool of a brother couldn't accept that was beyond her. But then, most of what her brother did was beyond her.

"Moreover," Master Yeng continued and she affixed her gaze back to him, "I'm in debt to you for you're efforts in assisting young Roland."

"Yes, but is it not you who said a student learns best teaching another?"

"Did I? It does sound like me, though I can't quite recall the occasion."

Terra dipped her head. "I believe it was at a commencement ceremony some years back, though I confess I can't recall the exact date."

"I'm honored you committed the words to memory."

Master Yeng was a well known figure within the world of martial arts. He should not be surprised his words were known, though sometimes the greatest teachers could be woefully ignorant of their own prestige. His resided in taking youth and turning them into warriors.

And the thought niggled her mind.

"Pray you forebear my boldness, but you said 'young' Roland. Is he not our peer in age?"

Master Yeng looked surprise for a moment, then laughed. "Oh, I'm afraid I've done you quite the disservice, my Lady. Though he has quite the stature, I'm afraid Roland has yet to see his fourteenth winter."

He was _thirteen!_ Terra rocked back in shock. Impossible. She'd taken him as younger than her by maybe a year, two at most. But this would place him four years her junior.

Thirteen!? A dozen small clues fell into place. His manner, his speech: what she'd written off as byproducts of his breeding could easily be attributed to youth. His occasional clumsiness, breaches of etiquette, spurts of earnestness. Dead gods, she saw it now and it was so blindingly obvious it hurt. What was the greatest strength of a child of thirteen? Their _imagination_.

She'd made a terrible mistake. Roland was no fool; he was simply a young child with an imagination. Perhaps he hadn't actually intended to run away; perhaps he'd truly thought it was an adventure; perhaps he'd gone exploring— because that was what kids _did_. And then finding himself far over his head, and having barely survived, he spun a story that fit his imagined adventure.

Because that's what... kids... did... and she'd driven him away with her disapproval.

A crack drew her attention back to the barracks. Her brother had kicked close the door instead of setting down a bag to do it with dignity. So childish— her anger flared, but relief followed when she realized he was actually dressed properly.

She sighed, grateful for that mercy. She'd feared he would arrive in his training clothes purely out of spite. But his coat was neatly arranged, top hat well positioned, and even his undershirt contained no obvious wrinkles. It was unusual for him, and she couldn't help but suspect he'd done it specifically to throw her off.

In some ways, her older brother could be quite the child, and perhaps that's why she'd so easily written of Roland's own idiosyncrasies. Here now, before her, was such a perfect example of how a supposed adult could, in fact, be an overgrown child.

Master Yeng met Ven and then, to her horror, offered his hand. It was a lowborn gesture, a grave insult to any Royal, yet her brother took the hand and they shook with a familiarity she did not understand. The whole episode might have angered her, but she'd seen how Master Yeng would meet with others exactly where they are. To her, effortlessly polite; to Ashter, quite measured words; to Ven...

She couldn't here their words, but watched closely their faces. A brief frown from Master Yeng, a quick shake of the head. Ven looked disappointed. Master Yeng said something to which Ven visibly rolled his eyes in an unseemly fit of immaturity, yet nevertheless seemed to concede whatever point was made. And then...

Terra realized she had stared for far too long. She tore her eyes away and flushed at the breach of etiquette. She'd grown lax these past months; she would need diligence in her return to society.

A light squeak signalled yet another door opened. The Lady Rose walked out, Roland a few steps behind, and suddenly everything was happening too fast.

Terra's mind spun desperately for a way to salvage the situation. Had she intended to adopt Roland into her Chair's influence, she'd have already made the proper overtures— secretly of course —and arranged to have Roland removed from his current Lady's influence. To do it now, without his acceptance, would be risky and could seriously damage trust between them. Besides, it could also be construed by some as kidnapping, though that didn't really bother her much.

The real issue was _loyalty_. Any asset with Roland's talent— and he _did_ have talent... gods, thirteen! She couldn't get over it; he was approaching her in talent and skill, even setting aside his trait. Even before, she would have called him talented, but at thirteen? Prodigious. It would take any Royal with half a wit less than a breath to try to steal him away. Loyalty truly was the only defense, and it just happened to be the one thing a Royal could not buy. Oh, she'd seen some fools try, but they only ever purchased greed, a thing easily bought out yet again. No, loyalty could only be grown from seed.

And she'd spent the last couple months smothering that seed.

She stared at him, ignoring protocol, trying to will him to meet her eyes. He wouldn't. He looked at Ven, Master Yeng, Ashter, but her? Her he ignored. It wasn't as if it mattered. She couldn't impress upon him her regret via look alone. She couldn't make the appropriate overtures. She couldn't tell him she was sorry, that she didn't— well, she still didn't believe him, but she had forgiven him.

And she could save him.

She could take him from this place and shelter him under a Chair that would see him grow and thrive. She could do this, if only she had the time. If only she'd been smarter and discerned a truth so obvious now that it hurt to even think about.

She averted her eyes as the Lady Rose's eyes weighed upon her person. That woman... she knew. She knew the boy's worth. She would not give him up easily. But the Chair of Belcia was not a trifle. They had extensive resources they could bring to bear, _would_ bring to bear.

Terra's resolve firmed. No, this was not lost. She _would_ have Roland installed as an asset to her Chair... or, well, her mother would. But it was Terra that would see him safe, sheltered, trained.

No, she would not cower.

She tore her eyes from the mountains, again, and placed them back to Lady Rose with force. But the Lady had never stopped looking at her, and despite the force of Terra's gaze, Lady Rose's lips twitched up, almost into a smug smile. It was the first time Terra had seen her porcelain facade break. After only a moment, she returned her eyes to Roland, though the boy remained willfully ignorant of the silent battle raging around him.

Ven had noticed Lady Rose's arrival and broken off his conversation with Master Yeng. Terra's shoulders tensed when he walked toward her. For a brief moment, the horrifying idea that he might actually assault her flitted across Terra's mind. But no, he was holding his bags in hand and it would be stupid to assault the only person here who could manipulate anchors. Stupid, yes, and yet... she just didn't know what he would do. He'd always been unpredictable but generally restrained enough, yet of late his obsessive nature made her just a little afraid. He could ruin so much, so easily.

He stopped midway, almost center of the courtyard, looked around with a vaguely imperious countenance.

He smiled. "Well I daresay this has been just a fascinating learning experience these past months but, as all good things must end, so shall we not prolong this farce it's conclusion?"

Terra closed her eyes for a moment, forcibly restraining a sudden overwhelming desire to strangle her brother. When she opened them, Roland was staring at her. She paused, caught off guard, but then smiled the kind of welcoming smile she'd use for an old friend. It _was_ the wrong kind of smile, inappropriate even, but Terra's pride was not so great she couldn't swallow it under great need.

He flinched back, looking confused. This was not the cold shoulder she'd given him and he clearly didn't know what to do with the change. She tried to impress her reassurance, but her smile faltered a little. His youth was so _obvious_ now. How she'd missed it boggled the mind. But mistakes were only failure if you failed to learn from them, and Terra would not allow herself failure. The situation _was_ salvageable.

She firmed her smile and walked toward Roland, pointedly ignoring the Lady Rose's gaze. She stopped a pace before him and granted him a deferential nod. While she knew the subtleties of her gesture was quite well beyond him, Lady Rose _would_ understand. Terra had quite thumbed her nose at the woman, which was oddly satisfying.

"Training with you has been a rare pleasure," she said, putting as much warmth into her voice as she dared. "I do pray we have more opportunities for it in the future."

There: an overture, and right under the Lady Rose's nose.

Roland's eyes widened, looking scared. He clearly had no idea what was going on.

"Uh... ummm. Yeah, ah me too," he stammered.

So obviously _young_. Such an opportunity. Terra decided on one last breach of etiquette, a gambit she'd never have considered before. Yet how could she return to mother without employing every tool at her employ?

Terra reached out, took Roland's hand, and squeezed lightly. It was a gesture far beyond allowable in society or otherwise. The scandal alone would have set her back months, perhaps years. But as she looked into his eyes, she knew it was the right move. She saw hope and a quiet desperation for warmth that strummed a chord of guilt in her. She wanted to say more, anything to regain the trust she'd damaged, but she'd gone as far as she could.

She stepped back, allowing polite to overcome her smile, though she kept the warmth in her eyes. She was being watched, she knew. She straightened her spine, lifted her chin, and shifted her gaze to the Lady besides him. She removed every trace of warmth from her eyes, a clear challenge. The Lady Rose met her eyes for fraction of a disinterested second, then turned away. The woman began walking out of the courtyard without a word. Roland followed, but he looked back twice.

Ven walked up beside Terra, and raised an eyebrow. He looked amused. She didn't bother with a response. Instead, she retrieved her bags where she'd left them, and trailed the group.

The Lady Rose led them around the house, down a small stone path that arced around the side and met up with another path that led out of the "front" of the house. Normally, one would expect it to intersect a road of sort, but this one ended in a small circle. Buried beneath it would be the anchor, a thing of inestimable worth. Chair Belcia had exactly three, not counting the one embedded in their Spire. They guarded them very, very carefully; they were not, in other words, buried out front of the house.

The Lady Rose placed herself at a very specific place around the circle. This was not unusual. Terra was well accustomed to how gates were formed, and knew aligning properly with an anchor would drastically reduce the effort to form a gate.

The Lady gestured toward Ashter. "You will go first."

Terra blinked, then cocked her head. That _was_ unusual. She'd assumed they would all leave together to whatever public anchor the Lady Rose had access to. In fact, Terra had been counting on it. There was a general limit to the distance a Traveller could gate to. The Lady hadn't gated them here from any anchor Terra was aware of, which in retrospect was also impressive, though she'd been too distracted at the time to think on it. Regardless, the public anchor combined with their original origin would narrow down considerably the location of this... school, but with a third point, things became much easier. She would need to make it a point to inquire of Ashter where he was gated to as soon as possible.

A gate takes three seconds to form. Nobody knew why it was three seconds, but it was _always_ a consistent three seconds. So after about ten seconds of waiting, Terra started to get nervous. Lady Rose was not gesturing or poised or even looked at all concerned, but she was focused and clearly trying to do something. It was just that nothing happened.

An elbow in her side jerked her attention away. Ven leaned over.

"Performance problems?" he whispered.

She almost, _almost_ rolled her eyes at that. Instead, she straightened her back and waited, politely. She may not like Lady Rose, and she would be quite happy if the woman embarrassed herself, but Terra would not demean herself with lowbrow jokes.

Still, after almost thirty seconds the was tempted to at least pose the inquiry. While the Lady looked quite unconcerned, others were starting to shift their weight and look around. Even Master Yeng bore a frown. Just about the time she'd decided to ask, she was forestalled by a feeling. A pull. She looked closely at the circle and realize something was happening. The light had bent just slightly.

Terra focused on it and with fascination realized the distortion was slowly gaining definition. She leaned forward, eyes narrowed. It was in the shape of a gate so it could be— no, it _was_ a gate, but one in the process of forming very, very slowly. She hadn't realized such a thing were possible. At this rate, it would take several minutes for it to fully form, and that went against everything she knew about Travellers. That three seconds wasn't dictated by the Traveller, but by the anchor, or so she'd been told.

But perhaps... perhaps Rose had discovered something? The idea rankled Terra deeply, that such an obtuse being might have realized some secret truth that even the Empire knew nothing of. But there was no denying the formation before her eyes. Clearly, Lady Rose could slow down a process that was never intended to be done slowly, and that was remarkable.

But the why was more important. Why do it? What did she gain by it? There were only two answers that made any sense: it increased the distance the woman could travel, or it increased the number of anchors she could attune to.

The first was problematic in that it would obscure the location of this place, making it harder to divine. Terra couldn't rule it out, but she considered the second option more likely. It was all but obvious that Lady Rose had attuned to three anchors. At her age, it would be considered an achievement of a lifetime, but what if it weren't raw talent, but technique instead?

If so, then just the knowledge that such a technique existed was priceless. It was truly a worthy offering; Mother would be pleased. She glanced over at Ven, wondering if he recognized the significance of what was happening, but he still appeared amused at this own joke.

The gate did not take as long as she first expected. Once the distortion could be seen clearly, its definition began resolving at an accelerated rate. The final formation occurred exactly as Terra would have expected. So it was just the initial stages that had been slowed down.

It lent her a bit of relief, for while gates were generally considered safe, there was always the occasional accident. A momentary slip of concentration from the Traveller could easily disintegrate a passenger. She heard of stories, barely more than rumours really, where a tired Traveller accidentally eradicated himself, those ill-destined to travel by gate, and even the gate room itself. It was why Travellers were treated very well, and given plenty of leisure time. Yet to travel by a clearly experimental gate?

She was suddenly glad Ashter was going first. It was... not a thought worthy of a Belcia, and Terra was ashamed to have thought it.

She was still relieved.

Terra had a small heart attack when, after the gate was formed, Lady Rose _turned away_ from the gate while it was still open. For a moment, she was certain they were all about to die. She felt light headed and swayed from a surge of adrenaline. She had to remember to breath again.

Seconds passed and nothing happened. For all that they stood on the edge of oblivion, Lady Rose simply looked over at Ashter and raised an eyebrow.

Ashter had turned bone white, swaying lightly on his feet. He looked ready to run, as if that would help. Then he looked mildly panicked as he realized _he_ was supposed to walk through. Terra could see the conflict on his face, the war between running and accepting.

"At your leisure," Rose said, voice even, without even a hint of strain.

Ashter blinked, then seem to come to himself. He jerked down to grab his bags and walked stiffly to the gate. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then pushed through to the other side. Terra silently commended his bravery.

The gate unravelled quickly. The light that had been streaming toward it quickly veered off. The perfect black constricted to a point, then disappeared. A moment later, the only sign that a gate had been there was a line scoring the stone where it had been, one among many.

That, at least, had been normal.

Rose immediately walked to a different part of the circle and began the process again. This time, Terra watched closely, cataloguing as much of the process as she could, though she hardly knew what to look for. And she was drawn into the event itself. It was like watching a wave suddenly slow down and an assault a cliff slowly instead of crashing into it like it should. It was beautiful, in a way, to see it.

Then it was done. A perfect black oval, a gate, instant travel reserved only for those of means or talent. Terra and Ven looked at each other while Rose once again turned away from the gate to look at them. He shrugged, picked up his bags, then smiled politely.

"After you, my dear sister," he said without a trace of mirth.

She hated him for it, because he had to be laughing himself silly inside. Yet he'd done it with a straight face, and the only acceptable response was gratitude. She would have to be the one who went first— there was no other choice —but she'd be damned if she gave him even the slightest hint of fear or hesitation.

She swallowed hard, stiffened her back, picked up her bags, and walked calmly to the gate. The corners of Lady Rose's mouth twitched up, clearing reveling in Terra's discomfort. Repugnant woman. Terra studiously ignored her and pushed through the portal without pause.

Unparalleled beauty greeted her. Terra gasped, then blinked hard against a morning sun. Cold tendrils of wind whipped against her, but she paid them no heed. She took four steps forward then absently dropped her bags. She had eyes only for what lay before her.

It was a vista unlike any she'd seen before, and she had seen some incredible ones. She had stood on the tallest spire and looked out over the clouds themselves. She'd seen city and lands lain out before her like toys before a child, with people naught but invisible specs below her. She'd been privilege to sights most could only dream of, and she'd thought she'd seen beauty true.

She'd been wrong.

The height upon which she stood beggared any spire. It was cities and towns that were the specs here, if they could be seen at all. The world before her curved beneath a sun casting through clouds spears of light that speckled a land, slowly drifting with the breeze. It was the world as it was meant to be, clean and unspoiled, beautiful. To each side of her, impossible cliffs stretched, sheer and imposing, a wall through which none could conceive of passing. And she stood at the very top, looking down as though a god would it's creation.

"Oh," said a voice from beside her.

She turned to her brother and saw wonder on his face. For once, she felt no wroth toward him, no hostility at all. They stood on sacred ground; they shared this sacred moment together. And it was a moment as rare as it was beautiful; she was just glad he was there.

But his shoulders slumped and he frowned.

"I'm so sorry," he said, then cast his gaze down. " I get it now."

A dread began to creep into her heart even as the cold ate at her. Her breath came out in stark puffs of white.

"What?"

He didn't answer, but instead turned slowly to look back the way they'd come.

She turned, uncomprehending.

"Oh no," she breathed out.

There was no gate. There was nothing but a single line that scored the mountain upon which they stood.
