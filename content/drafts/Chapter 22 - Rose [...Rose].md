# 22 | Rose [...Rose]

Rose stood alone in the early hours of the night at the center of a shopping square pimped with ornate store fronts. Her evening gown was blood red, and belonged more in a ballroom than on the street. Her hair, pinned up by diamonds, was silver and reflected the starlight. It framed a face that was young and eyes that bore the weight of centuries.

Across from the square towered a bank, imposing an array of thick stone pillars. It stood silent and dark except for glimpses of a single flickering through the windows as it wove its way inside.

Rose watched the bank, the light within, and waited as one would a foregone conclusion.

From within the bank came a loud crack, the shock of it deep enough to feel in her chest. She smiled, her eyes trained on the bank as silence reasserted itself.

A second crack filled the night soon after the first. The bank rumbled and its lines shifted, but it was a slight thing, hardly noticeable if she hadn't paid attention.

"I take it this is your doing, my dear?"

She jerked her head to the side in surprise, then let out a frustrated huff of annoyance while she tamped down the racing of her heart.

A man stood beside her with a bored expression. He had not been there a moment ago. He was well-dressed in the fashion typical to the area, with tight pants coupled with a loose but well-cut coat, open to catch the breeze and expose a partly unbuttoned and pleated shirt, hair loosely tussled yet precise. It was exactly the current style.

There were precious few that could sneak up on her like that, fewer still that would dare, and of them all, only one that would do it purely to annoy her. But he was the best assassin the empire had, which made him one of the few she couldn't kill with impunity, and perhaps not even at all.

"You." She unclenched her jaw and worked it back and forth as she returned her attention to the bank.

He chuckled. "Me."

"What are you doing here, Sylas?"

He surveyed the building and cocked his head to the side. "A good question—"

A third shock staggered the bank. Several windows shattered as the shift in its structure twisted their frames. The bank endured under the strain, clearly broken though it remained upright.

Silas pulled a paper from his pocket and looked it over, lips pinched. Curious, she glanced over long enough to see it was a bank draft.

"The bank isn't open," she said without a trace of sarcasm.

"Such a perfect time to transact then."

She smiled and shook her head. Sylas was no thief. He was here perform — or forge, depending on your view — a perfectly legal transaction, all so he could avoid waiting in line. It was just like him, exactly something her would do, and it made her nervous. It’s not that she didn’t believe in coincidence. They certainly did happen. She just never trusted them.

She looked over at him as he released the paper to the breeze. "Loose much?"

"It was a good contract."

"You could wait until they rebuild."

"You know they won't."

Her voice was dismissive, bellied by only a slight tightening in her eyes. "Banks have reserves, contingencies for this sort of thing."

Sylas scoffed. "And you stand here on a whim I'm sure. No, I hear your banker friend has quite the gambling problem, spends all his time down at the docks."

Her jaw clenched; he shouldn't have known that. "A personal problem, I’m sure."

"Well," he drew the word out, "I suppose it would be if he hadn't drained the bank to fund his habit."

Her body tensed. "Surely, the city won't allow one of their most prestigious banks to flounder."

He rolled his eyes. "Don't take me for a fool, Rosiland. The whole province teeters on financial ruin. I don't know what game you're playing here," he gestured to the bank, "but I'm not the only one who's noticed."

She stepped back, hands sliding into carefully concealed slits hidden in the folds of her dress.

He waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, don't be dramatic. I have no contract for you, and no intention to meddle."

She released the knives and relaxed only a little. "Then why?"

"A favor, nothing more."

"For whom?"

"Ah," he tisked, "but that would be—"

Another shock radiated from the building, and they both turned back to the bank. She raised an eyebrow, mildly surprised it hadn't collapsed yet.

Sylas shook his head. "I was going to transact."

"Of course you were. And to what point?"

He snapped his fingers rapidly, then pointed at her. "You know, I just *knew* I forgot to ask something."

Her suspicion solidified into certainty. You don't send an assassin to watch observed unless you intend to send a very specific message.

"I won't let it collapse, not entirely," she said.

Sylas didn't appear to hear her. "Is that fire?" he said.

She tore herself from her musings and peered at the building. An orange glow flickered from the windows. "Curious."

He shook his head and tsked. "Cheap wood, cheap bastard. I suppose that's what happens when you build a house of lies; it all goes up in flames eventually... with a little help, of course."

A new shock resounded from the building. The bank thundered as the back half collapsed to tilt the front up, which released several false pillars to fall forward and shatter. Only two pillars on the ends remained.

She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and smiled. There was nothing so satisfying than to see a plan come together.

A man staggered out the front amidst the smoke, backlit by the flames. He was gaunt and haggard, and though his cloths belonged to the merchant class, they were dirty and disheveled.

"Who's that?" Sylas said.

"His name is Joren."

"Right," he said slowly, "so is there any particular reason Joren is single-handedly tearing down a bank in the middle of the night? …which is impressive, I might add."

"He might be under the impression the owner of the bank stole his money."

"Huh, doesn't quite seem—"

"And slept with his wife."

"Well, that certainly—"

"And killed her."

Sylas blinked slowly. "Ah, that would do it. How many of those impressions are true, I wonder."

"Two of them."

”Huh.”

It had taken her a long time to find someone powerful enough to tear down a bank, yet calculated enough to do it at the right time. In the end, all the authorities would find is a heart-breaking story of love, betrayal, and suicide, with not even a hint of her involvement.

Joren walked to the left pillar and raised a hand toward it, but then looked around as a distant thumping of feet signaled the approach of soldiers. He turned back to the pillar and let out a scream that cut short as the pillar cracked. The man collapsed, but the pillar remained. It groaned under the strain and then finally snapped a few moments later, causing most of the building to collapse in a loud crash. Only one last pillar of gravwood held up what remained.

Sylas raised his eyebrows. "He is powerful."

"And quite talented, I might add. He picked up on some things rather quicker than I expected."

"So you trained him?"

An annoyed frown flickered across her face. "Of course."

He looked at her a moment, frowned, then turned to look at the man, who had rolled over onto his side. "And then you broke him."

She didn't bother with a reply.

"It's just so… excessive."

"Said the assassin."

"My interactions are generally much shorter in nature."

"Besides," she continued, "how it happens is just as important as what is accomplished."

Sylas opened his mouth, paused, then closed it and shrugged.

Joren had barely managed to push himself to his feet and shuffle over to the final pillar while the pounding of feet filled the air with the promise of institutionalized violence. He glanced nervously down the street, then returned his attention to the column. His breath came quick and rapid, his lips curled in rage, sweat beaded on his face.

The pillar snapped just as a large contingency of soldiers rounded the corner in a disciplined jog. The bank crumbled entirely as smoke and fire streamed from its sides in a last gasp of life. Joren collapsed to the ground in exhaustion, his chest barely rising at all.

"Well, he's certainly thorough, but I wonder why he hasn’t run. He could have gotten away."

"I don't think he much wants to live right now."

"A common malady with you, I suspect."

The soldiers quickly surrounded the fallen man and pulled him up, arms under shoulders, while the fire regained its passion. It flowed over the roof in a blaze that spread light over the street.

Joren's eyes caught on her and widened in recognition. "Jocelyne!"

He tried to take a step forward, but the soldiers held him back. Joren looked around in confusion at the arms holding him, then looked back at her and blinked as though at an apparition. He shook his head to dispel the delusion, yet she remained. His eyes jerked back to the soldiers, and his face went rigid. Several soldiers started to turn to follow his gaze.

With a gesture, Joren sent the soldiers flying.

Several ended up with bloody noses and a couple didn't rise at all, but a few recovered quickly and leveled their lances. The space around the tip of each lance twisted the light and then raced toward their target with a loud thwamp. At a few paces from Joren, the warps refracted around him and tore off in another direction behind. Whatever they hit twisted and crumpled.

"Jocelyne?" Sylas said.

"Only a name, as good as any."

The rest of the soldiers recovered and surrounded Joren in a practiced maneuver. He raised his arms in defense, his back to the burning building, yet never bothered to preempt their verging onslaught with his own.

All fired at once.

Joren stared at Rose in a confused daze as the warps inched closer. The soldiers fired so much that the man appeared to ripple and twist in the fire light. A couple of soldiers on the ends cried out as refracted warps tore the armor off one, and a chunk of an arm from another.

"He won't last much longer," she said.

The man was shielding, but he couldn't possibly hold out for more than few seconds at best. She pressed her lips together as the seconds passed; Joren needed to die for her plans here to succeed.

"Perhaps I trained him too well."

Joren dropped to his knees in exhaustion, and though his shield held, the spatial distortions barely missed him. Even so, the occasional distortion would grab at him and tear off chunks of cloths first, then flesh, and send them back to slam against what was left of the wall behind.

Joren looked to Rose in a confused and broken desperation. She returned no smile, no encouragement, nothing. He had but one last purpose, and it was simply to die.

Joren dropped his eyes, and then his hand. Barely a moment later, all that was left was a bloody mess staining the front of a collapsed building.

She breathed out and turned. "Well, I would say that went—"

Sylas was gone.

She looked around but there was nothing within a hundred paces to hide. She closed her eyes and forced several slow breaths through her nose. Gods but she hated that man.

She returned her attention to the scene to find most of the soldiers trying to contain the fire, a few left to clean up the mess in front, and a couple more to handle the wounded. Everything had gone almost exactly as planned, ignoring Sylas of course. She would need to move much more carefully going forward, but that was ever the case.

She turned to go when a clear, singular note sounded a high tone in her head. She frowned. One of her anchors? She should have been able to tell which one by the tone, but time had buried the memory. So she turned, sensing the strength of it until she faced it beyond the western mountain ranges.

That… was impossible. That anchor was located in one of the most remote and hostile places in the world. It was more of a safe house than any place she regularly visited. She couldn't think of anyone that would know where it was, much less capable of getting there. More importantly, some of her more potent weapons were stored there.

Another alarm sounded, and then another.

Suddenly she was caught in a tide, a subtle pull that she would have sworn shifted gravity itself. It grew slowly, peaked, then reversed into a push. She thrust a hand out to steady herself, wavered on her feet, and then the pull receded.

After a few more seconds, every single one of her anchors, almost two dozen in all, were sounding out a cacophony of clear notes in her head.

She began to tremble; only the gods held that much power.

She looked back at the soldiers. Two of them had stopped to look around, their faces quizzical, but after a moment they shook off the feeling and went back to their business.

The first tone ceased at about the time panic had set in, and so she calmed herself and waited. Another went silent and then another. After a few more seconds, all she could hear was the crackle of flame behind her.

Only the gods... but that was no god. They had removed themselves from the world a long time ago and no god would be stupid enough to risk their own council with a display of power like that.

That left only one option: a godling.

No, she smiled, not just a godling, an opportunity. A god in a bottle in her pocket, provided she got to it first.

She turned around to look at the remains of the bank and the soldiers at work. She had plans here but a godling under thumb could collapse an empire if used right. Her plans here could wait, and many of them needed years to ripen anyway.

She turned back to the first anchor that sounded. It had gone off long before the others. With a little work she could triangulate the source.

She reached out to the anchor and pulled on it in her mind. Shapes visible only to her formed in front of her. They began as simple planes that folded in on themselves to form a rough oval. More followed, hundreds at first, then thousands, then far more than she could perceive as the oval resolved into perfection. The shapes compressed until the space inside stretched toward the edges to create a lensing affect. It punched outward into a horizon composed of a single point. That point expanded until it filled the oval with what appeared to be the very absence of space and light, a perfectly formed tear in reality, a portal.

The process took only three seconds, and once completed, Rose stepped through it.
