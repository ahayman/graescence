# 4 | Liars and Fools [Dia]

Delving into the mountain for treasure was a stupid thing to do.

Dia felt that truth in the damp cold, in the dust that coated everything, and in the suffocating darkness. Most of all, she felt it in the trap hidden beneath the stone barely three paces from her.

She knelt, examining the floor of an empty hallway carved from stone into delicate arches that converged into fluted half-columns. Her breath drew shallow; her motions stilled. She was a single wrong move away from an excruciating death whose only grace was its brevity.

The mountain suffered no fools.

_And I'm no fool._ But the words felt like a lie worn too thin.

She closed her eyes, shutting out the only source of light in the hallway. She pressed a hand into the cold stone floor. The other held a lamp carved into spiraled filaments from an elderin core. It fed on her graescence greedily. In exchange for her essence, the lamp offered only a weak glow deep within it, casting corrugated patterns on the wall.

The poorly-crafted lamp was only one of two pieces her team could afford.

She hated it almost as much as she hated delving. Inefficient and crude, the tech wasted most of the energy she fed it. Its flaws chafed her mind like an itch she couldn't reach. Replacing it wouldn't help—she'd still _know_ it existed, its imperfect craftsmanship polluting the world. No, she didn't want another one; she wanted to fix the one she had.

Except she couldn't. Whoever made the lamp had done the best they could with the primitive tools they had. Even if she could do better, she'd always be limited by the tools. Always, she'd suffer from the unscratchable itch, unable to satisfy her deepest longing.

Unless she could find something better. And thus she found herself here.

_I'm only a fool if I die,_ which, of course, is what every deluded fool tells themself when delving.

Delving was a fool's game. There was simply no way around it. Only the rich could afford the tools needed to detect and bypass the traps; only the poor were dumb enough to try. It made for a wonderful partnership, outfitting the desperate with just enough tools to maybe survive long enough to enrich their patrons. The only thing more idiotic than accepting such a tainted deal was to attempt a delve without those tools.

Exactly the kind of stupid Dia and her team had been attempting for months.

She waited, allowing herself to remember facts she'd never known. It started with the simple certainty that tech was three paces in front of her. It presented as something she'd always known, like remembering the light panel in her room. It was a thing known, a thing unquestioned anymore than the algid stone pressed beneath her fingers.

As the seconds passed, more knowledge filtered in.

She opened her eyes, locking them to a spot on the featureless granite floor.

_A single line embedded into the floor, trailing from a..._ She glanced over at the wall. _...a trigger tied to a graescent sensor. Hmm, standard stuff._

Standard stuff except the craftsmanship was flawless, wasting not even a grain of graescence.

She returned her attention to the floor, waiting. It wasn't a process she could hurry, nor one she could stop. She'd tried both, repeatedly. Distance, use, and time were the only factors. The closer the tech and the more graescence it was using, the faster she knew.

An image began to resolve itself in her mind.

_An arc? Yes, curved fields emanate from a point, then cascade in on themselves, collapsing into intense fields of gravity. Ah, a crush then._

She stood up, feeling relief. Some traps could be avoided, and while a crush was not one of them, it was presently the only trap her team could disable.

_Now maybe we can end this farce—_

She felt the air first, that breeze of compression from someone passing close. A short man with bushy, expressive eyebrows strutted by her. _Strutted_—he wasn't even looking, his head twisted around, ogling Kalina, a girl five years his junior. Again.

Dia's mind short-circuited for half a second at the sight of such breathtaking idiocy. She blinked and, yes, he really was going to blithely step into a horrifying death.

"Dammit, Tait," Dia shouted while yanking him back.

"What!? The door's right there!" he bellowed, thrusting his finger down the hall of carved stone.

Dia trailed her eyes down the corridor, where it ended abruptly in a flat surface of pocked stone. On the right glimmered the faint outline of an empty door frame.

"Three times now," she growled, shoving him away from the trap until his back hit the wall.

He snarled at her something incomprehensible.

"Three. Times," she repeated, "I've saved your sorry ass—"

"There's _nothing there,_" he shouted, slowly, as though talking to an idiot. He leaned up at her. "It's just an empty—"

A meaty hand appeared on his shoulder, causing him to freeze. The dimwit turned and looked up at Moore. His expression rearranged from outrage to suppressed nervousness.

"What's the first rule?" the oversized teenager said. Tait grew still, his eyes dilated. Moore might be younger than Tait, but nature had given him heft beneath an intimidating layer of fat.

He was also soft-spoken and kind, but nobody felt inclined to tell Tait that.

"Always listen to..." Tait's mouth twisted into a sneer, "Dia."

"Man, you've got a death wish," Malek piped in. The lanky boy stood well back from them, safely observing the drama with disbelieving amusement.

Dia pushed off him, shoving him against the wall. She practically growled her frustration, and not all of it directed at him.

Delving was a fool's game, and Dia was no fool. But she had followed a fool into a delve on an empty promise and... she didn't know what that made her.

It wasn't her fault. She couldn't have known he was a blundering idiot. It's not like they announce themselves. He'd come to them with sweet words, spinning a tale of honest betrayal and secret revenge. His delving team had cruelly cut him out of his hard-earned loot—not his fault, the rat-bastards all of them—but he had a secret only he knew that would usher them to untold treasure.

All he needed was a team, a team who'd defied the odds. A team like Dia's. An... unofficial team filled with desperate teens who'd never been recognized, who'd never even managed to scrounge up the bare necessities for delving.

Okay, so maybe it _was_ obvious in retrospect.

_I'm no fool. I'm only following the fool..._

"Kali," she said, turning to her best friend, "you have the cap, right?"

Kalina raised an eyebrow. "A crush?"

"Mm-hmm."

"Yeah, hold on."

Kali pulled out a half-sphere of carved Elderin from her pack and handed the device to Dia., the wood grain reflecting a ruddy-tinted deep brown. A carved channel circumscribed the top where a handle would normally be attached.

Dia took the cap and unraveled a short length of loosely wrapped rope. One end wrapped around the channel to replace the broken handle.

She spared another glance at Tait and the selfishly guarded, brand-new pack strapped to his back. It looked like a delver's pack, unused and stuffed with so much graetech she couldn't discern any individual piece.

_It makes no gods forsaken sense. Did he steal the pack?_

She concentrated on the mass of information, trying to tease out a single strand, but the cacophony of overlapping tech made the attempt impossible, like reading a hundred overlapping books at once.

Noticing her attention, Tait sneered back at her, then lazily averted his eyes down the hall while assuming a bored expression.

Dia placed the half-sphere device on the floor, flat side down and slid it across the granite while holding the end of the rope in the same hand as her lamp. The cap missed, then jerked to the side when the rope ran out.

She pulled on the rope, ignoring the cynical scoff coming from behind her. She forced herself to unclench her jaw... again.

Dia shoved the cap down the hall, cursing under her breath when it caught some unseen ridge in the floor and skittered off aim. A sigh of disdain sounded from behind her, scarcely loud enough for her to hear.

She breathed out slowly. _Don't commit murder, don't commit murder, don't commit murder..._

Dia jerked as Kalina knelt beside her and placed a hand on her shoulder.

"You want me to try?" Dia's friend gave her a knowing smile.

"No, I..." Dia huffed out her frustration.

"Hey, we're close right? Just one more trap and..." Kalina glanced over at Tait, who watched them with narrowed eyes.

"He's a child, Kali," Dia hissed low enough only she could hear, "a child pretending to be a delver."

Kalina pressed her lips into an amused smile.

"Yeah, yeah, I know—" Dia relented, "—we are too, but at least we take delving seriously. There's no way he's delved before."

"...no, probably not. But we did lie to him—"

"By what, telling him we'd delved the floor before? So what? I _know_ the traps, Kali. As far as he should be concerned, I'm working off memory. But he's treating it all like a joke!"

Kalina bit her lower lip. She took a deep breath. "He's a man-child, Dia. They're... I know you don't think highly of our boys—"

"Moore's a soft-hearted brute."

"Of course he is, but you think he's simple _and_," she held up a finger, "you think Malek's dim."

Dia's face pinched. "I'm reconsidering my definitions."

"Well, Tait may be older than us, but he's... inexperienced. He's a boy trying to prove himself a man and—"

"I've saved his life three times now," Dia said through her teeth.

"—you're kind of showing him up."

"You know," Tait's smug voice broke in, "if you're in over your head, all you have to do is ask."

Dia might have lunged for him right then were Kali's hand not restraining her. Instead, she glared daggers until her best friend squeezed her arm, reminding her now wasn't the time.

Kali leaned in. "It was a mistake. I'm sorry; you were right. We never should have taken him on, I don't care what kind of tip he claimed to have."

"You don't believe that."

"It..." A flash of frustration darted across Kali's face, gone so quickly that Dia barely noticed. "No, I—"

"It's fine, Kali. We all agreed; it was worth a shot. He just gets under my skin."

Kali squeezed Dia's shoulder. "One more trap," she glanced down the hall, "right?"

"Yeah, just the one....alright, let's finish this before our resident fool decides to off himself again."

Kalina smiled. "Do your thing," she said, scooting back.

It took Dia three more tries before she got the anti-crush tech over the mine. She stood, loosely holding the end of the rope, reasonably certain the crush wouldn't turn them into a ball of flesh.

"Alright," Kalina clapped her hands, "Tait goes first—"

"Hell no!"

"I'll go first," Dia said in a weary voice, "as usual."

She walked over the cap carefully. The trap activated as she passed over, generating a sudden clarity of knowledge in her mind. She almost visualized the way the greatech interacted with graescent fields produced by the crush, resonating to produce counter fields to contain them.

A mine that even now would be crushing her into a condensed ball of human flesh.

She faltered a moment, shuddering at the contained violence beneath her.

_I hate this so much._ It wasn't a new revelation.

She shook off the dread and continued along, rope kept loose in hand until her fingers met the frayed end. She knelt, watching the others.

Sensing her mood, Kalina turned to the others, face serious.

"Fine, Malek, Moore, and I will go next. And Tait can—dammit."

Tait had edged the wall while Kalina spoke, staying conveniently out of Dia's reach. He shot her a dismissive look followed by a sniff while shaking his head and rolling his eyes at the same time.

She suppressed an irrational urge to throw him in the crush. She didn't, of course—that would be murder, and she didn't do murder. It was rude if nothing else.

He moved to the edge of her light, leaned against the wall, and began tapping his foot impatiently. The other three followed in sequence, careful to stay as close to the wall as possible, far from the death device hidden centered in the hallway. Dia pulled the cap back to herself and handed it to Kalina, who replaced the tech in her pack. Without drama or murder, she walked toward their destination.

She stepped through a cracked door frame, her feet billowing a small cloud of dust into a room occupied solely with detritus. Tables, chairs, and cabinets had long ago devolved into piles of rust and wood rot, while dust conspired to merge them into a lumpy floor. A skirt of shiplap paneling clothed the lower quarter of the wall, leaving mottled stone naked above it.

_Two panels, two leads, five conduits, four leading to empty light sockets, the fifth to... a pair of rails?_ She waited for the knowledge to settle. Too much knowledge. These rooms were always stripped bare by prior teams. _Did someone miss tech in here?_

Dia raised the lamp above her head and fed the graetech more of her energy, pushing the light deeper into the room even as the tech babbled into her mind its many flaws.

_Poor filament design, inefficient, conflicting resonances, misaligned woodgrain, leaking energy like a sieve... I could fix it._

But only if she had an Inscriber, one of the few devices that could create graetech. She felt the lack like a missing limb, forever denying her a scratch to her itch, that visceral need to _create_. Her desire for one was the only thing that kept her delving into dark places.

_There's no Inscriber here, and I'm a half-wit to think there ever would be._ She knew the lie from the start, yet still, disappointment curdled her abdomen.

Dia rubbed her forehead while lowering the lamp. "Tait, your source is shit."

Tait pushed past her, snatching the light from her hand as he passed her. She glared at him as the light flickered before he restored the flow of graescence.

"No, no," he said as he walked to the wall and bent over to examine it, "this is exactly right."

"Is it here?" Kalina said as she stepped up beside Dia. "It better be here Tait, cause if we wasted two hours—"

"Yes, yes, I swear. Somewhere..." He began tapping on the wall.

Kalina and Dia shared a look of disbelief as Tait began to edge his way around the room, tapping and listening to the wall, looking for secrets.

"Is that what we've been doing wrong all this time?" Kalina asked, dripping with sarcasm. "We should have been tapping on the walls... how did we miss it?"

Dia's head tilted as she observed the man-child meticulously tap on each panel.

"Move," Malek said as he pushed through them. "You're blocking the—what is he doing?"

"Looking for something?" Moore said as he followed Malek.

"Not gonna find it that way," Dia muttered.

Malek cocked his head. "...why?"

"That paneling is made from structural Elderin. Stuff's indestructible. They literally use it for soundproofing."

Malek leaned against the wall, chuckling while he eyed Tait with the look of someone expecting to be entertained. Kalina picked out several clips from her pack, using them to pin back silky black hair that remained suspiciously clean. Moore's brow had drawn down as he scrutinized the man-child's actions, trying to understand them in the hope of finding some redeeming quality hidden beneath.

They were a mismatched group of unlikely friends straddled the wrong parts of society. Malek's thin face bore mongrel features, mixing dark brown skin with round eyes and a narrow face. While Moore hid mixed parentage beneath a layer of muscle and fat, his threadbare clothes betrayed his station well enough. Orphan boys, both of them, forced to choose only by what fit the dredges of society condescended to give them.

They contrasted sharply with Kalina, the epitome of island beauty, where dark hair cascaded to frame a heart-shaped face decorated with deep brown, almond-shaped eyes, an elegant if small nose, and ample lips. She complimented herself with clothes self-tailored fit well in an island style only a generation out of style and softened by too many washes.

Trade island beauty for pale-nut plainness, and silky hair for a matted-wavy mess, and the result would be Dia. Yet where Kali strove upward, Dia worked hard to appear less, choosing the least interesting clothes to accentuate her plainness.

"Tait," Dia said after she'd had enough, "room's been picked clean. Whatever source you think you—"

"It's here!" Tait exclaimed, fondling the wall, "just give me a second."

"I call crush," Malek declared. "He's been cagey from the—"

"It's not crush," Tait turned, eyes flashing. "I told you, I just couldn't talk about it cause..."

Malek waved his hand. "Yeah, you don't want word getting out. But really, I think you got had, and you don't want us to find out."

Tait huffed. "We're looking for a panel."

Dia's face flattened. "A panel."

She looked around the room, very deliberately eyeing the elderin panels lining the room.

"No, not a wood panel. A panel... panel, you know?"

Dia closed her eyes, her face melting to an expression of long-suffering.

"Maybe you should tell us about your source," Kalina offered.

Tait hesitated.

"That's it," Malek said, rolling his eyes, "I'm calling crush."

"No, no! Okay." He abandoned his search, frustration showing as he walked back to them. "This has to stay between us, alright?"

Dia shrugged, "Yeah sure, fine. Just level with us, alright?"

"Ah fine," Malek gave in, waving his hand, "whatever."

"Okay, you heard about those scores the Shet gang's been dragging up?"

Dia's brow creased, "Yeah, they've been hitting cleared sectors and finding tech everyone missed, somehow."

"Right, so they were drinkin' in my pa's pub, and I was cleaning up, and I overheard 'em talking about—"

"Wait," Malek pushed off the wall and threw up a hand, "so your _source_ is Shet's drunken rambling?"

"...no? Well yes, but listen—"

"I'm callin' crush."

"It's _not cru—_!"

"Alright!" Dia spoke over the others before the argument devolved into a shouting match. "Let's hear him out. We've already gone this far."

"Right." Tait drew the word out while staring at Dia in suspicion. "So they were using one of the dead sectors to umm, have fun..."

"We know what they do, Tait," Kalina interrupted, folding her arms. "Please get on with it."

"Right, so," he took a deep breath, "they accidentally found an access panel that led to the lower levels."

Dia blinked. "Oh, an _access_ panel."

_That's what that is._

"Oh Tait," Kalina said, leveling a look of extreme pity, "please don't tell me you led us down here because you think they might have _accidentally_ fed a..."

Dia tuned her out and walked across the room.

"Here," she said, kneeling before the wall opposite the door.

"Dia?"

The light bounced sharp shadows as Tait rushed over, the others trailing him.

"It looks rather like a wall," Kalina said.

"I don't understand," Tait stared at Dia in confusion. "I checked there already. There's nothing."

Dia placed her forefinger on the wall and pressed graescence into the hidden panel. Nothing happened, tempting her to doubt herself. She pressed harder, and a moment later her energy overcame the resistance.

_Okay, no one accidentally fed one of these._

The outline of a square drew itself from the shadows as a section of wood paneling shifted into the wall, then slid into a narrow alcove. They stared at a hole barely broad enough to swallow two of them.

"Well damn," Moore said after a few seconds.

"...what?" Tait breathed out as bafflement shattered his posturing facade.

"Tait," Kalina intoned, "did Shet's drunken rambling happen to mention where the dark foreboding tunnel leads to."

Tait blinked a couple of times. "I... ah, down?"

Kalina's smile shifted into a scowl. "I don't like it."

Moore raised an eyebrow. "You want to leave?"

"What? No, I just think it's a trap."

"Everything here is a trap."

Malek stared at him for a second, then turned to Dia. "Sense anything?"

Dia shook her head and raised her hand. "Light."

She took over the feed as Tait pressed the light into her hand, and lowered it to reveal more of the passage. Smooth granite pitched straight into the dark, then veered to the left at the edge of her light. Dia knelt and ran her finger along the bottom, rubbing off a thin layer of undisturbed dust.

_Too thin. The tunnel's been sealed for a very long time._

She peered down the dark tunnel as hope and dark foreboding warred in her. She'd never heard of tunnels like this. That couldn't be a good thing, and yet...

_If ever there's a chance to find an Inscriber, it would be down the dark creepy tunnel..._
