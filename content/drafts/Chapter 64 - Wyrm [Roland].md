# 64 | Wyrm [Roland]

Despite his best efforts, pushing through the undergrowth was a noisy affair, and after several minutes, he was drenched in sweat, with new scratches all over, and his arm throbbed despite Ellie’s cycle.

He glanced down at his arm and increased the energy flow in his cycle in the hope it might alleviate the pain. It seemed to help, maybe, but he wouldn't be able to keep this up for long.

After a few seconds more thought, he removed his sword from his back and looked around at the growth surrounding him. It wasn't exactly made for hacking, and he was sure Rose wouldn't approve, but she sure as hell wasn't the one pushing through a thicket of thorns.

He braced himself against the pain, fed energy into the blade and... nothing. No pain. He let out a delighted laugh. The cycle directed the energy around the wound instead of through it. If that was the only thing this cycle-thing could do, it was damn well worth it.

While the blade sliced through the brush as easily as the air itself, it did not help as much as he’d have liked. He still had to clear it all away and the thorns had no issue grabbing his arm. Swinging his arm around wasn’t helping the pain. Eventually he switched the sword to his off hand and discovered the wrap provided decent defense against the thorns. Had he been smarter, he’d have done this from the beginning.

He desperately wanted to be quieter, but he had no idea how to make the plants bend away from him as they did Ellie and hacking them up was even noisier than pushing through them. It was a bit easier and quicker, and that alone made it worth it, but it was nosier. He also left a very obvious trail.

"You sound like an oversized bear chasing its fleeing lover,” Ellie said from behind him.

He just about jumped out of his skin, then stopped as he considered her words. Was that even a thing?

He shook his head in an attempt to clear the troubling image from his mind. He'd been too focused and forgot himself. Not that it would have helped. The girl was just walked through the thicket like it was an open field.

He rounded on her in irritation. "Just how do you bend things like that?"

She looked back at him with wide and innocent eyes. "Well, I don't know... I just _bend_ and space bends."

He stared, blinked, then growled. When she wasn't an angry goddess, everything was just a game, but he knew well enough that she'd rejected his question. So instead, he glared at her. It might do nothing but make him feel better, but that was enough.

Glaring, it turns out, is only useful for so long, and after a few uncomfortable seconds, he turned to hack at the bushes.

"I've never tried this before, so it might feel weird..."

He jumped again and almost cut off his arm. She'd spoken into his ear from directly behind, close enough to give him a hug, which seemed stupid until she did exactly that.

Then the world twisted, and he gagged.

The world stretched and contorted unnaturally until vertigo overcame his senses. It wasn't just the light that bent. The weight of the world also twisted and pulled him in all the wrong ways, as though down had ceased to care from what direction it hailed from. He leaned back against the only solid thing left, which was still holding him tight. If not for Ellie behind him as a reference, he'd have fallen over, or up, or even sideways. He had no idea which way he'd fall.

The twisting stopped and left the entire world distorted. The brush was curved and stretched so that a clear path appeared before him, yet it was like no path he could ever conceive. Thick, thin, line, curve, long, and short had smeared their meanings. His world clashed with impossible contradictions of stretched thickness and thin shortness, impossible angles, straight curves, and curved straightness.

His mind railed against a reality that could not possibly exist.

He tried taking a step forward and fell into a twist. Ellie grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him out, but in that single step, he realized he could never adapt to this. His foot should have gone forward, and it did, but he felt it pull and twist in a hundred directions. Every sense screamed at him the wrongness of the world.

"Stay close to me. I'm not sure I can keep this up if you move away, and I don't know what'll happen to you if you cross the barrier." Her voice sounded with a weird echo that reminded him of her 'goddess' tone. The sound must travel through all this twisted reality, causing it to splinter down different paths so that it arrived at slightly different times.

"How can you stand this?" His own voice sounded alien and weird to him.

He felt her shrug. "It's not that bad really."

It was possible the most disagreeable thing he'd ever heard spoken.

With some effort, he tried to walk, but each step felt like he was walking over a mountain — not off it, over it, including each and every dip, hill, valley, rivet, twisting stream and whatever else it might have. After a few steps, his stomach forced him to a stop. He replaced his sword in his harness slowly, mostly as an excuse to let his stomach settle.

He was forced again into motion by necessity. Standing still was only marginally better than walking, so the only thing that would ever work was simply to get it over with. Easier said than done, and after a few minutes, he found himself longing to return to the brutal hacking of thorns.

Despite his difficulty walking, they made much better time than he could have otherwise, no matter that it felt like hours. And then the world finally untwisted itself, except now his mind had no idea how to process it. He might have been even grateful that he wouldn't have to spend the next couple hours slashing bushes, but vertigo had taken over.

"Well, that certainly took longer than normal."

He moaned and leaned against a nearby tree. "Never mind, I don't ever want to learn how to do that."

"Well, that's rude. Certainly, a thank-you should be in order."

Roland responded with a wordless sound that twisted off his tongue as he slid off the tree and onto the ground. He distantly noticed his face was buried in the dirt, so he tried to roll over with only moderate success. He satisfied himself with only half his face planted and the rest of his body was — actually, he had no idea what configuration the rest of his body was in.

"I didn't think it was that bad."

He knew the world was right, but he couldn't perceive it correctly. It was as though his very mind had been twisted. It was not a comforting thought, that she could so warp a mind's spatial orientation and render is useless.

He wasn't sure how long it took for him to recover, too long for certain. The world, or his mind, slowly untwisted until he could stand, though things still looked wrong to him.

He rolled over onto his hands and knees and looked up at Ellie, who had an amused smirk on her face.

"I don't understand how you're standing."

"I never considered it would be so difficult for others. You always move so oddly."

"We move oddly." He tasted the words as he pushed himself back on his knees and looked up at her. "What do you mean?"

She gave him a strange look, thoughtful and hesitant, then shrugged. "You think you move in straight lines, but you don't. Your path twists between the weights and masses of the world. Your mind lies to you. It tells you the world and your path is straight, but it has twisted everything until straight is little more than a meandering path through masses you don't understand. It’s like your mind has contorted itself, twisted itself into a hundred little lies. Today was the first day you have ever walked in a straight line."

"I..." was sorry he asked. “Wait, so the world _I_ perceive is twisted, but I don't know it because my mind twisted with it?"

She shrugged. "It's more like your mind tricks you."

"Then how do you walk normally?"

"You mean, how do I twist through the paths like you?"

He nodded, though he wasn't sure he was actually following the conversation.

"I just change my perception. Like putting on glasses or taking them off."

"Oh, okay... uh, what are glasses?"

Her mouth dropped. "How do you not... okay, you know what, nevermind. Are you ready?"

"No."

It took him another minute, but he finally got to his feet. By now, he felt only a little disoriented, well enough to at least start moving again. Ellie watched him with pursed lips and a thoughtful expression. Seeing him steady, she snapped out of it and flashed him a smile.

"Now, the hard part is avoiding the Wyrm."

"You've seen it?"

"Yep, and oh is it looking for you. Good news, it should be a fair distance from us. Bad news, it's still in the direction we need to go, and ah, well, we have a ways to go."

Of course it is.

He nodded to her, and they headed out at a good pace without so much undergrowth in their way.

Ellie impressed him. While it was obvious she lived here, he hadn't given much thought to what that meant, yet at times he would forget she was even there. She moved with a silent ease that put his own efforts to shame. And she moved quicker than he thought she should, somehow eating up the ground without any visible effort.

He struggled to keep up with her. No one moved through the forest like that without living in it for a long time. He wasn't _pulling_ yet, but he had longer legs and excellent stamina.

His arm tingled and burned, but on the whole felt a lot better, which surprised him — the whole cycling thing really was useful. He _pulled_ on a pair of Whitewoods, launched himself forward, and smiled as the wind whipped his hair. He _pulled_ again as he descended, and then again immediately on another to correct his angle. He'd eaten a large swath of the forest when he landed at a run.

He still maintained his pace but looked back at Ellie, only to find her next to him with a grin plastered on her face. He couldn't keep the shock off his own.

There was no way she ran that fast. She wasn't even breathing hard even though she was running.

He looked again. No, she wasn't even running.

What the hell? It was more like a light jog. The longer he watched, the more unnatural her movement appeared. Each step she took seemed to eat up vast swaths of distance. He looked at the ground and felt vertigo slam against his mind.

Woah. He stumbled a little and returned his attention to the path ahead.

He _pulled_ ahead, but of course, she stayed right with him. He refused to look back at the ground. She was obviously doing her bendy thing to eat up the distance, which at first felt unfair until he realized his _pull_ could be considered just as inequitable.

They moved much quicker without his fear of leaving her behind. He _pulled_, she jogged, and they ate the distance. They passed over another mountain ridge into a valley he didn't recognize. Only then did dawn on him just how far they were from home. While he’d known it from the ranges, the distance hadn’t registered. He'd only traveled into the next valley over before meeting her, and they'd not run long when she told him it wasn't far. Yet now they travelled over ranges of mountains to get back.

What else could this girl do? She could practically bend herself out of existence. She ate up leagues in small steps. She twisted paths into reality where there should be none. She—

Something slammed into him and sent him flying through the air to strike a nearby tree.

He got up slowly, checked himself, and then growled in frustration. He'd been distracted yet again, but despite the surprise attack, it hadn't been powerful enough to cause harm.

Ellie was nowhere to be seen, but that was expected. The problem was, nothing else was there either.

The forest was silent. Even the wind seemed to have stopped to hold its breath for what came next. He never really considered just how eerie a silent forest could actually be. It felt like an in-held breath of a predator, and a growing certainty took hold that this predator was the Wyrm.

He suddenly wished Ellie had been lying to him.

He scanned the forest for anything that might be the dragon or even dragon-like, but nothing stood out. He should have asked more questions. What did it look like? Could it turn itself invisible like Ellie? He didn't think it likely, but then how could something that large hide? Or was it large at all? Every instinct told him it should be large. It was a _dragon_, so of course it would be, but assumptions could kill here.

Not knowing created its own kind of terror that ate panic into his gut as he failed again and again to find his attacker.

A movement drew his attention, and his eyes snapped forward to a Whitewood set back in the shadows. He almost dismissed it until he saw it move.

It was a slight thing, almost unnoticeable. But Whitewoods didn't move. They were more like granite statues of a tree, and seeing granite move, even if just slightly, was an unnerving sight that screamed at him.

He looked closely at the Whitewood. It was too smooth, too regular. It didn't taper in the way a tree should, and there was that ever so subtle sway. With growing horror, he realized that the magnitude of scale for his definition of large would have to shift dramatically. His eyes tracked up the 'tree' longer than he would have liked to end in a head that was almost the size of a small house.

That head stared at him patiently, waiting, judging.

Breath became difficult as he took in the whole of the beast. Only about half its body was raised with the rest curled up around it except for the end of its tail, which remained free and unnaturally still. Along its back, he saw what could have been wings folded up tight against its body, but it was hard to make them out in the shadows. The worst part was its eyes, which had a cold, alien intelligence in them that made him shudder. There was no bluster here, no anger or outrage. Just a calculating, predatory intelligence, singularly focused on Roland alone.

The hunter had found its prey.

He had no illusions. He could not fight this thing. His sword would barely scratch the beast, whereas it could no doubt swallow him whole. His only hope was to outrun it, and he wasn't sure he could do even that. His only hope, distant as it was, would be for the forest trees to slow it. It was not a bright hope.

He stood as still as possible and kept his eyes locked to it. Any movement could trigger the fight he desperately wanted to avoid. He mentally cast about for a tree he could anchor to. He found one and attached his anchor.

The beast's eyes narrowed, and its body tensed.

That was ominous. Had it actually sensed what he just did? Ever so slowly, almost as if it hoped not to disturb its prey, the Wyrm lowered its head into a crouch. He decided not to wait to see what it would do.

He _pulled_ hard and yanked his body to the side into an uncontrolled spin. With a loud crack, he lost his anchor as the sapling pulled up from the ground, and yet it was that mistake which saved him.

The Wyrm struck where he would have been had his pull succeeded. It missed him by a few inches, but he did not miss it. He struck its side hard as it flew past. His spin reversed and sent him flying at an odd angle until he struck the ground.

He jumped back up, anchored to a nearby tree, and _pulled_.

He heard a sound like wind come from behind, but he ignored it. He _pulled_ in rapid succession, grabbing the next tree just before releasing the prior in a desperate attempt to move quicker than he ever had before.

He never let his feet touch the ground. His flight became erratic as he _pulled_ whatever he could grasp in a frantic attempt to flee the beast.

A few times he found a pair of trees and _pulled_ hard on them both. His flight became even more uncontrolled and volatile, but he zig-zagged, and maybe that would be hard to follow. The trees flew by him in a blur, and a small part of him realized that he was actually flying.

His mouth tasted bitter. His first real flight and he couldn't even enjoy it because he was fleeing a monster bigger than a house.

He tried to sense the creature behind him but heard only the wind in his ears. After several minutes his curiosity overcame his need for caution. He turned his head to glance back and squawked out a gasp of despair.

The Wyrm was only a few feet behind him.

It glided silently through the trees like a snake might through water, yet its wings were still folded tight against his body, apparently useless in actual flight.

He redoubled his efforts and _pulled_ harder than he ever had before at a speed that would see him instantly dead were he to hit a tree, a branch, or really, anything at all. He couldn't keep this up long before he made a mistake, but he had no other ideas. He risked a glance back and saw the Wyrm still only a few feet behind him.

It was toying with him.

He doubted it would allow him to slow down, but he refused to be driven into making a mistake like this. Already he felt on the very edge of what he could handle, or beyond it. He was barely missing branches that could spear him through. He was one mistake from death. He needed to stop, but preferably not inside the thing's mouth.

Instinct. He let out a breath and anchored before he could think about what he was doing.

It was a large Whitewood, and he left the anchor loose as he flew by the tree. He next chose to bind a tree on the same side as the prior one, just a little further back from his path. He finally bound a third anchor to another tree deeper off his path.

He _pulled_ hard when he got close to the upcoming tree and veered off so quickly that spots formed in his eyes. He let go of the second anchor, now attached to the tree behind him, and _pulled_ on the other two to swing around the larger tree with the angular momentum he had generated. After he made it almost entirely around the larger tree, he anchored to another behind him and slowed himself down to land back on the path behind where the Wyrm should have passed.

It was an incredible maneuver, and he would have been grinning from ear to ear had he not found himself once again staring at the Wyrm, eye to eye.

It had calculated where Roland would end up, maneuvered, stopped, coiled, and then stilled completely before he even had a chance to land. It was an absurd demonstration of its ability with a very clear message. It could have him at any moment it chose.

He choked on despair.

It was as though it wanted to study him and understand him. That alone called forth a special kind of terror in his soul. A patient enemy who sought to understand its prey spoke of a level of intelligence that he suspected not many possessed, even among his own kind.

He needed to move, but the Wyrm blocked the way. Not that it mattered. He was confident he could never escape it. He'd try, of course, and then he'd die. He was no amateur at facing opponents far beyond his skill, but where Rose showed a semblance of mercy, this beast offered only death.

He anchored himself to a tree off to the left and readied himself to pull. Before he could, the Wyrm whipped its tail and sent a spear of gravic energy that shattered the tree. His jaw dropped. Whitewoods were all but indestructible. They did not shatter.

Cautiously, Roland tried another tree, and again the Wyrm whipped its tail and shattered it. It never moved its head, and its eyes never left him.

He felt a cold certainty descend on him. Here before him was death and its mercy, and before this, he was utterly powerless.

Suddenly, the space around the Wyrm's head warped and twisted.

It reared back and thrashed its head about as it tried to dislodge the distorted reality around it. Its head twisted, stretched, and shrunk. His eyes went wide as the beast toppled over and smacked its head against a tree before it thrashed on the ground as it let out a horrible wailing moan.

"Are you really going to just stare at it with that stupid grin on your face?"

He was grinning and decided it was entirely appropriate. "Yep."

"Okay, I don't know how long it'll remain disoriented. How about we leave before it recovers... unless you want to be dinner tonight?"

Tonight. He cast around for the sun and found it descending on the ridge. Already evening. He glanced back at the beast.

As much fun as it was to watch the beast thrash, she was right. And yet he couldn't resist watching for a few more moments.

He found a suitable tree quickly and _pulled_ without a word. As he left, he heard an irritated growl. He chuckled, though he couldn't tell if he was laughing at her or in relief. He decided it was both.

She caught up a few moments later. At this speed, her spacial manipulation was obvious. Easy strides ate up large portions of the forest floor while he flew through the trees. The casual way in which she ate distance made him wonder just how far a single step could take her.

He felt good, really good, far better than he should. He kept giggling, and he was shaking. He wanted to keep flying like this forever, free and unconcerned of death or monster. He marveled at how quickly things had turned.
