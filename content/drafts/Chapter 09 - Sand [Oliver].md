# 9 | Sand [Oliver]

_The Slave Plantations of Ionia. Outer districts._

Sand had a way of getting in everywhere. Every crack, every nook, every crevice. If it existed, sand was there, irritating what should be nothing more than a simple walk.

Or run. Running was important too.

And Oliver ran at a pace that surprised even him. No matter the sand chafing in places sand should never be, he ran. Because anything less than a full sprint would result in...undesirable consequences.

Turns out, the need to run doesn't diminish the irritation of sand.

It was a thing Oliver filed into the back of his mind, far back, deep beyond any hope of retrieval. Because right now, the thing Oliver needed most was to run.

No, no, not run. Running was stupid, except for a means to an end. Oliver needed to _get away_. Away from the homicidal idiots pursuing him. Running wasn't important. Escape, though, was.

But where? He didn't know. That was a problem for future him. Never mind that said future approached at the speed of sand viper.

Sand kicked up in plumes as he ran.

"Slow down you son of a whore."

"Rude!" Oliver yelled over his shoulder.

Because it was. Seriously. Who called someone's mother a whore? Only bullies, or idiots. Mothers are mothers, not whores. Any fool knew that.

Not that he knew who his mother was. She died a long time ago, along with his father, probably, maybe. May they rest in peace, whoever the hells they were. Still, it was the principle of the thing.

"Just give it back...you...fool!"

Ha, that one was cooked. Not even able to give a proper riposte. The idiot was huffing and puffing, and barely a moment away from planting his head into the sand.

If only he were the only one.

A thud confirmed Oliver's suspicion. He glanced back to see the fat boy's feet flailing over a head that had firmly entrenched itself into the sand.

"Ha ha ha! Endurance matters you fools! You'll never catch Oliver the—ooof"

Blessed blackness blotted out the sun for only a second before he forced his eyelids open with reluctance. His head pounded something fierce like he'd been hit with a bat.

"What the...ugh. Wha...where's the bat?"

"I'm sorry, Oliver the what?"

"Huh?" Oliver blinked a few times before three ugly mugs resolved into view. Behind them was a rocky outcropping he was sure he wasn't aimed for before he turned and gloated. While running. Perhaps that wasn't the smartest idea. "Ugh."

"No, really. I want to hear this," said a girl with stringy hair bleached too long in the sun. "You were just saying, uh, what was it? Hey, Jimmy help me out. What'd he say?"

A thin, lanky, nervous-looking boy with dark hair glanced between Oliver and the girl, looking...nervous. As well he should be. Between Oliver and the no-named girl, well, Oliver may be on the ground but no-name girl had no name. Oliver, however, had a reputation.

Or so he assumed.

"He said, ah, something like, 'You'll never catch me?'"

Both Oliver and the no-named girl shot him an incredulous look.

"You're an idiot."

It was the first thing the girl said that Oliver agreed to wholeheartedly, not that he would admit it, or that he'd heard the girl say much of anything before now. Or even knew who she was.

"Well, that was fun, but I'm afraid—"

"Give it back."

Oliver let out a long sigh and pushed himself up on one hand. "I'm sorry, give what back?"

Because he was pretty damn sure the girl had no idea what he'd stolen.

The girl's already flat face somehow flattened more. "You know what. Our boss wants it back, so hand it over before I take your balls and string them up like lights for the eclipse festival."

Oliver frowned in mock confusion. "I'm sorry, did you say wanted my balls?"

The lanky boy and the other...lanky boy snorted. Honestly, Oliver wondered if they were brothers. Even the fat boy with his face in the sand snorted, probably. Hard to tell with a mouthful of sand.

The flat-faced girl, now forever known as Flatface, began to turn red. It was not a good look on her.

"That's not what I—no, you're trying to distract me. You know who our boss is, yeah? He'll do you in for sure if you don't give it back," she said as fat boy ominously appeared behind her.

Well, perhaps not ominously. The sand covering his face kind of turned his mean expression into a joke.

Oliver did not know who her boss was. It was, in retrospect, an oversight, though not one he was inclined to correct. It wasn't that he didn't know any bosses, it was that he knew too many. Off the top of his head, he could think of at least a dozen local bosses that might take offense at...well, anything really. But certainly, they'd take umbrage to someone stealing such a priceless artifact as he'd stuffed down his trousers.

Or so Oliver assumed.

Add to that mess that their boundaries were constantly changing, and his safely stowed cargo could have been absconded from any of them.

Who kept track of that sort of thing anyway?

Oliver slowly reached down and intentionally scratched his balls with exaggerated motions.

Flatface somehow managed to turn even redder. Given how her nostrils flared, Oliver was pretty sure she was going to lung at him. That or her head was going to pop. He gave either option a fifty-fifty chance.

"Fine, you had your chance." Flatface gestured at the brothers. "Take him."

Or, well, that. She could have her goons do it.

Suddenly, Oliver wanted goons.

"I need goons."

Wait, did he just say that out loud? Judging by their confusion, yes, he had. That, however, provide just the moment he needed to fling sand if all their faces.

See, the thing about being on your back, is that you're on the ground. Well, okay, sometimes it's in a bed, but that's a completely different scenario. On the ground, most people label a situation like this as 'disadvantageous'. And sure, on the surface, it does look like the person on the ground is at the mercy of those looming above.

But no one considers just how many weapons there are down there. Rocks, stones, sticks, dirt, mud, and of course, sand, among other things. Hells below, there could be bona fide weapons down there. So many weapons. And, for some unknown reason, no one expects you to _use_ said weapons.

It was a conundrum that Oliver had never fully resolved.

Never, ever, _ever_ consider someone on the ground defenseless. Oliver was of the opinion that a person on the ground was, in fact, the most dangerous kind of person there was.

He had no clue why nobody seemed to understand this. But he sure as the hells below had no compunction against using it to his advantage.

Flatface screamed; the twins screamed; even fat-boy screamed a high-pitched sound that suggested puberty was still a long-suffering battle for the boy. Oliver had managed to fling sand in all their eyes. He was mildly curious, though, as to how and why fat-boy didn't already have sand in his eyes. The boy had face-planted rather spectacularly, after all.

"_Get him!_" Flatface screamed.

Oliver pushed himself to his feet and brushed off the sand. He wasted a full second watching the others with sadistic satisfaction as they cast about for him like blind men.

Then he ran, but not before cackling out, "later losers," because it was important to make a dramatic exit. And cackling. Nothing drove home the despair of failure than your opponent cackling at you while you flailed about blindly in the sand.

The outer sands, or the outer districts as some called it, consisted of a labyrinth-like maze of sandstone protruding hundreds of paces above leagues of endless sand. Most of the locals just called it the labyrinth even though it was hardly true to the name. Pick a direction and no one would have trouble making it out.

The true maze was below. Countless cracks and crevices led down to a warren of endless tunnels crisscrossing into double backs and dead ends. Many were manmade but far more were simply a product of natural phenomena.

No one had ever mapped them all. There was no point. Ionia's restlessness too often shifted, collapsed, or created new paths. Only the reinforced, manmade tunnels had any chance of surviving their cruel mistress's whims, and those never lasted as long as they should.

The labyrinth was both the bane of the Empire and the very reason the slave plantations could exist at all. All of those towering pillars of sandstone created a natural caldera that worked as a kind of sea breaker, calming currents of sand that could strip flesh from bone within seconds.

Without them, all those rows and rows of endless maize, corn, and wheat, all reaching into a hostile, red-tinted sky would have been long stripped to their roots.

Yet where the sand breakers allowed endless rows of grain to grow, they also allowed countless failed rebellions over thousands of years to hide within the warrens deep below.

And now, they were Oliver's only hope.

A fool's hope, but a fool's hope was pretty much a normal day for him.

Oliver ducked between two large boulders, then careened around another. He continued, taking turns seemingly at random. He slowed into a quick walk for a few minutes until he finally relaxed.

"Lost 'em, idiots."

He reached into his pants and—

"There he is! Get 'em!"

Oliver froze as a band of six rounded the corner and spotted him. Worse, none were the fools he'd just left behind. This was a new group.

"Flamin' gods, how many are you?"

They didn't answer, of course, but instead ran at him like a sand viper after its meal.

"Gotta find a better metaphor," he mumbled to himself as he turned tail and ran.

They, of course, didn't have the decency to let him gain some pace, so after only a few moments they'd already caught up to within a few paces of him.

Several times he reached down, scrambling to grab some sand and fling it behind him, but it never did any good. For whatever reason, they'd become wise to his methods.

Or perhaps this group wasn't comprised of the same kind of fools that plagued him earlier.

Turn and after turn Oliver took, heedless of the direction, only caring that he gain a pace or two beyond his pursuers.

And then they stopped.

Oliver slowed, feeling confused as he stopped, huffing from a lack of breath. He turned to find all six of them lined up at the edge of pillars.

The edge.

_Oh._

He turned away slowly from them to look upon the horizon, a dark horizon filled with violence.

"Shit." Death approached at the speed of a sand viper.

Again, with the sand vipers.

"I really need a new metaphor," he mumbled as he turned and ran parallel to the walls of the labyrinth rising hundred of paces and braced by sand piled there from the latest storm.

Hesitation marked his pursuers. They wasted seconds, torn between pursuing Oliver and not dying in the flesh-devouring sandstorm.

"Back," the leader snatched an over-eager minion by the shoulder who'd made as though to pursue. "Into the labyrinth. Keep pace! He's gotta come back in."

Which was true. But where Oliver had a straight shot, they had to dodge through the pillars and ravines and paths. It didn't take long before he'd outpaced them.

What he had not outpaced was the storm, which had grown into a thunderous roar loud enough he feared going deaf. Several seconds too late, he turned back to the pillars.

A wall of sand and pebbles slammed into Oliver's back, lifted him off his feet, and threw him deep into the labyrinth. He hit the ground hard and then flipped legs over head before sliding a dozen paces on his stomach.

He wasted precious seconds pushing himself to his feet. Or tried to. Not only did sand and pebbles rip at him, but the wind kept trying to lift him off the ground.

"What the..." The wind tore his words away before they could leave his throat.

He'd heard the storms were brutal, but nothing could have prepared him for this level of violence.

He gave up and crawled as fast as he could, scrabbling toward the wall, eyes squeezed shut. Palms out, he followed the wall for what felt like an eternity while the sandstorm scoured his back through the shredded remains of his shirt.

Cracks of thunder echoed through the ravine, drowning out the incredible roar of the storm for short moments before the wind tore them away.

Oliver hugged the wall, uncertain and terrified. The sandstorms produced incredible displays of lightning, but the sheer volume he heard now beggared belief.

Something exploded next to him, tearing into his side and throwing him from the wall, where the wind picked up him and dragged him dozens of feet. By the time he crawled back to the wall, he'd realized his mistake.

It wasn't lightning. It was rocks flung by the storm into the walls with such force they outright exploded.

Oliver hugged the wall again and began to frantically search for any reprieve. He nearly gasped in relief when his finger curled around the edge of a crevasse. It was small, barely more than a crack and not nearly large enough for him. But it widened as he followed it to the ground, just large enough, maybe.

He squeezed himself into it, worming his way as the stone scraped against raw skin until he was certain his feet were in far enough to avoid being obliterated by the rock bombs.

Though muted, the storm still thundered in a roar he could feel through the stone. It felt quiet, but only relative to the fury outside. Or he'd just gone deaf. That was depressingly probable.

His chest pressed against the stone with each breath, preventing him from filling his lungs. Aside from the encroaching terror of not being able to breathe properly, it was a stark reminder of his precarious position.

Never spelunk in Ionia. Every child knew this for one simple reason: those who didn't know were likely dead. Ionia was a cruel mistress who constantly shifted, like a fevered patient tossing in an endless nightmare.

She groaned before she raged. Tossing the ground, shifting passages, collapsing others. The quakes inevitably rearranged the labyrinth, sometimes even the reinforced passages made to withstand her temper. Any fool dumb enough to squeeze into...well, anything, would be turned into paste.

Oliver was a fool, not that he could do anything about it except pray that Ionia wouldn't wake up before the storm ended.

Ionia's storms could last for hours.

He tried to relax and slow his breathing. He wasn't claustrophobic by any means, but this was still pushing it. A jagged piece of rock dug into his stomach. His chest ached. His back felt as though he'd been whipped. He had one arm above, the other pinned to his side. His...

"Okay okay, calm calm calm."

Hours. He _had_ to relax.

He opened his eyes. Closed them. It made no difference.

"Fuuuuck."

He could not stay here for hours. Everything he'd been knew told him it was suicide. He wasn't courting death, he was embracing it.

"Nope. No no no, can't do it."

He began to push himself back out of the hole when a whiff of air brushed his face.

He paused. Waited.

More air. A fool's hope, but maybe, just maybe that air came from a bigger space. Probably not. Probably, it was just a crack. Yet the idea wouldn't leave his head.

It took him several seconds before he began pushing himself back into the hole. Twice he had to exhale completely to squeeze through spaces too tight for him without knowing where they'd end. On the second time, he almost passed out before he could squeeze himself through.

The cave opened up almost allowing him to crawl. Then there was nothing above him at all.

He reached up and, on feeling nothing but air, slowly stood.

"Huh."

He reached up on his toes and winced in pain as he stretched his arms above him. Nothing.

Also, his back was shredded. All he felt was a dull ache, but the sharp sense of tearing when he moved his shoulders spoke of a lot more pain in his future.

He pushed it from his mind. That was a problem for future him.

Satisfied he'd arrived in some cavern, he took four steps and...

...ran into a wall.

"Owww..."

He stumbled back, holding his nose, until he stumbled into the wall behind him.

"Gah, _Owww_!"

Sharp threads of fire burned through his back from the impact. He stumbled forward, hands out until he leaned against the wall. He moaned.

Future him was an asshole. Or, maybe it was past him.

It took what felt like an eternity for the fire in his back to die out, leaving a dull ache that lodged into his mind like a sand tick.

"Okay, maybe not a cavern."

More like a crevasse. He stood still until the flow of air became apparent. It came from above. He tilted his head up, staring into the black, while he felt the air on his face as it drifted downward.

There was no way he could climb it. The walls were too far apart, too sheer, too...wall-like. Also, he couldn't climb. Or, at least, he never really tried.

The idea of trying now seemed stupid. He couldn't see and had no idea of what lay above.

He'd have to squeeze himself back through the worm hole. That was not a thing he wanted to do ever again, especially not with his back all torn up.

He groaned and sat down.

"Owww..."

He reached into his pants and pulled out the small ball he'd sat on, only a little larger than a marble.

"All that for this."

He rolled it between his thumb and finger, then flicked it into the air. With practiced precision, he caught it on the back of his hand, allowing it to roll along the back of his hand right up to the edge until he flipped his hand over to palm it.

"Heavy."

It was. Surprisingly heavy. Oliver tossed it into the air, feeling its heft as he palmed it. It weighed on his palm like an iron ball twice its size.

"Ooookay, but...uh, what?"

It was heavy, sure, but heavy wasn't valuable, at least not as far as he knew. He ran his thumb along the surface, noting how polished it felt.

On a whim, he reached forward and scraped it against the stone. It came back unblemished, without even a hint of a scratch.

Oliver twisted his lips, uncertain, then shoved the thing into a pocket. Whatever it was, he wasn't going to figure it out in the dark.

"Better be worth it."

He had doubts. His true goal had been thwarted by an unexpected visit of the gang leader to his treasury. Treasury being a very generous term. More like a heavily guarded storage closet.

Oliver had memorized the guard's movements and slipped in effortlessly, only to be thwarted by the man's sheer lack of organization. A quick 'in and out' turned into a lot of rummaging through a lot of junk.

That was the moment everything went wrong. He should have left. He should have stalked right back out, found the little weasel who sold him lies, and beaten the little shit to within a finger of the kid's life.

But no, even the possibility of a priceless relic had Oliver rummaging through another man's trash.

He'd been dumping a drawer of junk onto the floor when the gang leader walked in. And no, Oliver still couldn't recall his name. But the look on his face? That he would cherish for a lifetime.

The ball he snatched as a consolation prize, mostly for the sake of his pride. A thief should steal _something_ after all, even if it is junk. Besides, the ball was pretty, a deep purple that seemed to drink in the light.

He leaned back, only forestalling his motion a hair before his back touched the wall.

Nope.

He leaned forward instead and placed his head in his hands. The ache in his back had reached a crescendo that was hard to ignore. It itched like drops of water crawling down his back and broke into flame with every small movement. The ramifications of that were not something he wanted to think about.

He tried to listen for the storm, but this deep it had been muffled into silence.

Time seemed to slow to a crawl. How long had he been sitting here? Felt like hours, but he was certain only a few minutes passed.

He wanted to pace, but the thought of agitating his back kept him from moving. He pulled the ball out again and started running it along the back of his fingers.

The motion felt oddly reassuring.

Back and forth, along the edge of his palm, flip the hand over, palm it, then flick the ball in the air and catch it on the back of his hand. And then again, and again.

After some time he snatched the ball out of the air and slowly put it back into his pocket. He _could_ hear the storm now, he was certain. A rumble so deep he could only feel it through the stone.

And then came the moan, that sound every child learns to fear.

"Oh no no no no NO!"

Oliver jumped up and placed his hands against the wall, as though that would do anything.

Ionia's moan turned into a growl and the ground began to tremble. Pebbles and dust rained down on his head.

The earth shook the stone around him, causing it to shift with a horrible grinding sound. Before Oliver had a chance to react, the floor collapsed from under him.

He reflexively grabbed at the wall, his finger nails scrapping stone but finding no purchase.

His shoulder hit something hard, sending him into a spin. He tried reaching out again only for his arm to smack against the stone. He defensively pulled his arms in, increasing the spin's velocity.

Before he could attempt anything else, his head bashed into the wall. Light burst before his eyes for only a moment before his conscious slid into silence.
