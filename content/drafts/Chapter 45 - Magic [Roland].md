# 45 | Magic [Roland]

Roland walked out into the courtyard and stopped to look for Master Yeng. Normally, the man would be sitting on a bench in front of what Roland had begun to think of as the barracks, though he suspected it was designed as servant quarters. Either way, it was a building he hadn't been in yet no matter how he tried and it was only going to get harder with the tutor coming in two days.

So many eyes to watch him. It was suffocating.

Roland slowly walked forward. Master Yeng wasn't there. He would normally stand almost the moment Roland walked out, a small hesitation the only thing betraying the man's age. They would meet in the center, and once again work on endless forms, stretches, and balance until every muscle quivered under the strain.

The door behind him opened and he turned to see Rose walk out. She continued over to a familiar chest, the one he'd rummaged through his first day here. She pulled out three wooden balls along with a wooden child's toy.

Roland frowned as he studied it. It had a handle that flared out toward the top into a quarter bowl. From the bottom of the bowl was attached a string about a hand in length. Attached to it was a ball that hung loosely. It looked like one of those toys a child might play with as they swing the ball around and try to catch it in the bowl without touching the ball.

She palmed the balls and handed him the toy.

"This is not a toy." He gave her a doubtful look. "Yes, it does look like one, but instead of flinging the ball, you must feed the handle to move the ball."

"It's gravtech?" He'd never heard of a gravtech toy.

"It's a training tool."

He looked down at the toy; the ball swung lightly. "For what?"

She hesitated, then spoke with a tired voice. "It's the first step toward using gravics."

_Magic._ A broad grin split his face.

"Do _not_ use that word."

But magic.

"I swear," her jaw clenched, "if I ever hear you utter that word out loud, we will spend the next six months on physical training alone."

His mouth clacked shut, but he couldn't hide the joy in his eyes. _Magic._

"Magic is nothing but superstitious nonsense uttered by simpletons; you are not a simpleton. Gravics is a discipline; it's science; it's math; it's _hard_. Do you understand? Treating it like magic will get you nowhere."

He schooled his face into as serious an expression as he could manage, and nodded solemnly. Yes, it was magic, but he sure as hell wasn't going to ruin it by _calling_ it that in front of her.

Instead, he said, "Like the runes?"

"The gravitica is strongly related, yes, and it'll help you in your training, especially as you continue to learn the underlying theory. "

She pointed to a random spot on the ground. "Now sit."

He sat, stared at the toy, and waved the ball around.

"Do not wave the ball. If I see you do that even once, I'll terminate this training and you can start again when you're ready... next year.

He arm froze, leaving the ball to sway. He snapped out his other hand to still the ball, then blinked at her.

Her lips pinched, then her face shifted into her teaching expression. Yay.

"Good. Control is paramount. Without it, you are subject to the whims of a power that can kill thousands. Without it, you are nothing but a walking disaster waiting to happen. Without it, you are nothing but a—"

"Okay, yeah, I get it. Control is important."

"It is _the_ most important thing. Your emotions, your expectations, your fear, your very hope: they all conspires to take away your control. Until you learn to control yourself, your body, your mind, the very energy coursing through your veins, you cannot be trusted."

"That toy you now hold," she continued, "represents the least amount of control you need to master. Until you do, you will not attempt even the basics of gravic manipulation. Should I discover you doing so, we will return to physical training for a year. If you persist, I will put you down myself."

And with that lovely admonition, she walked a few paces, rolled out a thin mat on the ground, and sat cross legged. She placed the three wooden balls in front and closed her eyes.

Roland watched her as the implication of what she'd just done — not said, but done — cascaded through his head. For the first time he could ever recall, she'd _lied_ to him. Oh, he had no doubt she meant every word of her little tirade on control. But there was one thing he knew she would not do: she would not kill him.

He was simply too important to her. She had spent months wasting almost every moment of every day training him. Then she hired a weapons master, a tutor was coming, and she fully intending to hire far more people. All for him. And, if he was correct, she intended to do this for _years_. How long, he didn't know, but he did know that she needed him for... something? Something important. Probably something with the Empire, given how much she hated it. Whatever it was, she sure as hell wasn't training him out of the goodness of her heart.

So no, she would not kill him, not so long as he was important to her. The moment that ceased to be true, though, was the moment she would strike.

Yet the lie she told bore on it an important truth: the control wasn't for him; it was for her. She needed him to control his power so that she could control it. Learning on his own would give him an advantage; it would thwart her control over him. It was the only possible reason for the lie. She tried to use fear to keep him from discovering his power on his own and, in the process, gave away her own fear. And _that_ told him exactly what he needed to do.

He would have to be very careful — he had no doubt her other threats were real – but for the firs time since he'd arrived here, he had his own path to forge.

But first, he had a puzzle to solve.

He picked up the handle and examined it. It was a plain handle with the center bowed outward a little. It felt ordinary, normal, nothing special, and certainly nothing magical. He pushed energy into the handle. The ball shot up at an angle and then bounced back at the string’s end. It settled into a small oscillation that traced a figure-eight pattern.

He cut off the energy. The ball remained taut for half a second before it slowly descended. He pushed energy in again, and the ball snapped back to the same place. He released the energy and the ball descended in the same way as before. He kept trying, snapping the ball out, letting it fall, looking for a pattern. There was none, or at least, nothing useful. It did the same thing every time.

Problem is, the ball did not seem to like the basket.

He sighed. It just couldn't be easy, could it? Maybe if he waved it around? He started to, then stopped when he realized he was dangerously close to the "waving" he'd been forbidden.

He looked up to see if she was watching and gasped.

Rose sat in the exact same position as before, but her wooden balls traced intricate patterns around her. It was beautiful in its complexity, mesmerizing, and far beyond anything he could have imagined. His eyes could barely track the balls as they traced what he was sure must be a pattern, though it refused to resolve in his mind.

He looked down at the child’s toy and tried to imagine how to get from that toy to her intricate patterns. He had a ball, she had balls, the connection seemed obvious. Master his toy, and he would one day do as she did.

He guffawed out a laugh at the thought, then flinched at the sound. He watched her face for a long moment but it face never twitched.

He snatched up the toy. He _would_ do that some day, no matter how she tried to control him.

He fed energy into the handle, and again the ball snapped out to that same position as before. He tried to will the ball to move, but that led to nothing, and he felt stupid, staring at it with such concentration.

This should be easy. It was a child’s toy, after all.

He fed energy, watched it snap out and oscillate in that irritating motion it was prone to, then released the energy and tried to move the handle under the ball, clearly aware he was pushing the limit of her restriction.

Still, the ball ran away.

He tried again with more force, mostly out of irritation, and the ball almost snapped back to the basket as it rebounded off the string. But just as before, it veered off its trajectory as it approached the basket.

He tried with only enough energy to bring the ball to the level of the basket, and trick it into falling in. That didn't work; there was always just enough repulsion to keep it out of the basket.

He tried several times to use the repulsion to balance the ball above the basket by angling the handle while the energy bled out. A few times, he came close enough to lure him into a new attempt, but the ball would never just go in the damn basket.

He yelled at it and threw his frustration into the handle.

The ball snapped out in its normal direction, but instead of rebounding, the string snapped. A loud crack echoed as the ball embedded deeply into a nearby tree. He stared wide-eyed at the now tree-embedded ball.

With a sigh, Rose opened her eyes. Roland felt dread, fearing he'd just cost himself his gravic training. He watched as each of her balls slowed and landed softly in her outstretched hand. She stood up as her hands closed around them.

Her voice came calm and quiet, but each word stabbed into his thoughts. "Those aren't cheap, or easy to find, _or_ easy to repair." She walked to the chest and pulled out another of the familiar toys. "This is my last one; do not break it."

He blinked in confusion at his luck, then spoke without thinking, "What about the ball?"

Her eyes alighted on the ball, then narrowed. "Do you know why we are here?"

Training? No, that wasn't the right answer. He shook his head.

"We're here so that your... irritation doesn't kill people."

She walked over to the ball and looked at it in apparent examination. It had embedded itself fully into the tree.

"We'll leave this as a reminder."

She turned, walked over to him, handed him a replica of the previous toy, walked back to her place, sat down, and within moments her balls were once again carving intricate patterns into the air.

A second lie; whatever her reason, it was not because she feared he would kill people. Yet that mystery was for another time.

He shook it off and stared at his new project. The toy looked almost exactly like the old one. He sighed softly, pushed energy into it, and once again, the ball moved in the same stupid direction.

There had to be a reason, and it had to be him. He was doing something wrong; he was wasting energy. She always claimed he wasted energy. It was one of the mantras she repeated endlessly during training. He always moved too much, wasted too much effort, lacked control, used too much force.

He took a deep breath and thought it through.

Gravtech was common enough: heaters, lights, and sleds were used frequently around town. But gravtech was also something nobody really thought about. Pushing energy was just something you do, not something you think about. He'd never heard of anyone struggle to figure out how to use one. Push energy and you get a light; push energy and you get heat; push energy and the sled lifts off the ground — no thought required. Like walking, it took effort, yes; thought, no.

So the toy required something different. If pushing energy wasn't enough, it must be _how_ he pushed the energy that matters.

He closed his eyes and tried to focus on the stream of energy as it left his body. He started with his hand and it felt... warm, maybe? His brow furrowed as he concentrated. He could imagine that the warmth was threads of energy, but he wasn't sure if it was only his imagination. It was something, though. He traced back the feel of the energy as it travelled down his arm.

It was more than that. It didn't just travel, it also picked up energy from his arm as it went. The further back he traced the energy, the weaker it felt and more spread out. By the time he traced it into his upper arm, he’d lost the trace.

On a whim, he switched hands, pushed energy into the toy, and watched the ball snap out in a different direction. He switched back, tried again, and the ball moved to its original position. He passed the toy back and forth a few times, but always it moved to a position dictated by his hand.

It really was him. He was the problem. If he had enough hands, maybe he could find one that would get the ball in the basket. Given he had no way to grow new hands, he needed to find a way to control the energy.

He closed his eyes, started again at his hand, and traced the energy back. This time he lost the trace before he reached his elbow. The edge of sensation and imagination blurred, but it was clear the flow of energy wasn't coming from a single source. It pulled from a thousand threads within his arm.

His conviction firmed. Those threads determined where the ball would go.

Again, he refocused on the energy flowing from his body and began to trace it back, but how many times had he done that already? He switched tactics. Instead, he lingered on the flow itself. He allowed the feel of it to fill his mind until he lost track of how long he’d sat there. Then, eventually, he came to perceive a small, almost imperceptible oscillation in the flow of energy, an oscillation that synchronized suspiciously with the ball’s movement. If he could alter the oscillation, perhaps he could alter the ball as well.

That turned out to be more difficult in practice than theory. Attempting to manipulate the threads of energy was very much akin to analyzing how he walked, and then altering individual muscles to change how he walked. In other words, it was virtually impossible.

He huffed out an exasperated noise and opened his eyes.

The sun had set, allowing the first of the stars to begin their nightly parade. An autumn chill has settled into both the air and his bones. He hadn't even noticed. Rose had left and filled the night with the smell of her cooking, which drove a spike of pain through his stomach.

He wouldn't have called the last several hours meditating, it was more like solving a problem, but he couldn't help but notice that he'd basically sat unmoving for several hours, completely unaware of his surroundings or even his own ever-present hunger. It was probably the longest he'd ever sat still his entire life.

He stood up through stiff muscles and aching bruises, then took a moment to move through some of Master Yeng's warmup stretches. He threw the toy back in its box and walked to the door.

He paused with his hand on the handle.

Power and control. If Rose ever had a motto, that would be it. But her idea of power and control was to wield it over him and force him into her mold. He would not— _could not_ —allow that, but the only way out was to master it first for himself.

He glanced back at the box and his eyes narrowed. He'd tried running away once; it didn't work; the only way was through. He fingers slipped from handle as he drew back to the box. He slipped the gravtech toy into his pocket, considered a moment, and then grabbed another puzzle and put it in the other pocket.
