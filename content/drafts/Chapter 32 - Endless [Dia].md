# 32 | Endless [Dia]

Dia and group walked into a tall, thin foyer soaring upward and arced away, narrowing into a edge. A hostess dressed in a tastefully revealing suite stood behind a crystal —podium. Her eyes took in first the others, then latched on Dia in wary panic.

Dia's attire suggested upper-middle class, _but_ she was accompanied by a group that should have been turned away. Placement was... complicated. The girl could loose her job for placing someone in the wrong place. Offending patrons could equally see her jobless.

The pleading look in her eyes told Dia that the girl would place them almost wherever they wanted so long as the Rocs were good. Dia walked up confidently, channeling her mother.

"Tenth floor on the rails," she said with authority.

She handed the girl about a quarter of the stack her mother gave her. The girls eye's widened as she counted the Rocs.

"Oh and..." Dia flipped over a few more Rocs and handed them to the girl, "for your discretion."

Yes, the idea of tweaking her mother was appealing, but it would also raise too many questions that Dia did not want to answer. Plus, that was more money than the girl would likely see in a full night. It felt nice to be generous... with other people's money, at least.

"Yes, of course," the girl flipped through a bound book and marked a page. She gestured to a server waiting in the shadows, who walked quickly to meet the group.

"10a, table 4," she said to him.

He nodded to her, then bowed to Dia and the group. If he noticed the other's attire, he gave no indication of it.

"If you would follow me."

They followed the man to a small lift lined with handrails. Dia walked to the rail and lightly placed her hand on it, knowing exactly how the lift worked. The others didn't, and the man turned to address them once he saw it.

"I take your companion has not seen fit to explain the peculiarities of our establishment?"

Kalina's eyes narrowed suspiciously at Dia, who patently ignored her with an overtly innocent expression.

_Oops._

"No."

Dia rolled her eyes. "You ruin my pleasure," she said, softening her words with a playful smile.

His lips twitched upward in response. "Ah yes, but if you'll forgive me, we've had unfortunate injuries and such would reflect poorly upon my person, I'm afraid."

_You'd have to be seriously sloshed to get hurt from a lift._ But she tilted her head anyway.

He turned back to the trio. "Echoes is shaped as an ellipsoid elongated along the vertical axis, the outside of which this lift follows. I recommend the handrails for safety."

Kalina moved next to Dia, copying her. The boys took a another second before they too moved to the rail.

Dia leaned over and whispered in Kalina's ear. "It's shaped like an egg, and the lift spirals around the outside of it."

Kalina gripped the rail and shot Dia a startled look, who just shrugged. It was hard to explain echoes— you just had to see experience it for yourself.

At this point the guide had shut the doors and was standing by a panel with two leads.

_Twin sets parrallel rails guiding four cores, allowing the lift to— gah! enough!_

Dia shoved the knowledge down, pressing it into a background murmur. She could never get rid of it but she could tune it out, rather like she could her mother, actually, something she had a lot of practice with.

Everyone swayed lightly as their guide fed the lead, causing the lift to accelerate gently along the spiral. After a minute, it slowed into an indiscernible stop. The guide opened the door.

They walked out into a twenty story, egg-shaped amphitheatre cradling a platform of brightly lit solid crystal. A thin strip of Elderin core circumscribed the platform, almost invisible. The stage rotated slowly, floating on an invisible flow of graescence.

Stairs cut down through wide isles layered deep to provide everyone with a perfect view of the platform. Tables arced along the each layer's curve, placed distantly so that even loud conversations would interrupt no one. Above, recessed lights shed domes of warmth down upon each table, lending intimate atmospheres isolated from the others.

The host deposited them at a table along the bottom of the balcony with a perfect view of the performers below. The table itself continued the theme, with etched glass framed by polished wood, stained with just a touch of red, hinting at the color of Elderin without pretending to be it.

Dia seated herself on the inside, away from the balcony, ceding the best seats to Kalina and... Moore? Malek punched him in the arm, then whispered fiercely. Moore's face soured, but he switched seats, if a bit reluctantly, leaning over Malek to take in the view.

Kalina had absently sat on the edge of her seat, child-like eyes wide in wonder as she stared out over the balcony. The crystal platform emanated a diffuse light, cast from within the circumscribed Elderin ring and distributed evenly throughout the crystal. Dozens of soft spotlights evened out the light, matching the crystal below so that every object on the platform could be seen clearly without shadows.

The platform was large enough to host truly massive productions, and frequently did. Tonight though, a more intimate affair had been arranged. Dwarfed by the platform around her, a woman sat in the center playing an instrument that was worth more than Dia's parents had made their entire lives.

_A Hashri..._

Dia leaned over and peered at the instrument, an open sided stringless harp. The tilted instrument pressed into the woman's shoulder while her fingers danced across the fingerboard leads. Instead of strings, rainbow strands of Glass flickered in and out of existence, generating harmonic tones that danced.

A complex melody filled the air, surrounded by sustained harmonies that would occasionally bend into a new key, dragging the music into a new form. Dia closed her eyes, sensing on the edges of perception a complex interaction of graescent resonances as they played around themselves, twirling and flowing throughout everything.

The suppressed chatter of endless knowledge fell silent within her mind.

The music didn't come from the harp. It came from the graescence the harp produced, teasing vibrations from the air as it moved. Sustained lows could felt from behind, supporting a melody that seemed to dance around her head before retreating to the fore.

"Unbelievable," Kalina whispered.

Dia settled back into her seat, a small smile on her face as Kalina slowly shook her head. There was something satisfying about showing off a new world to someone who's never seen it before, especially when it was as beautiful as this.

Dia's smile faltered when Kalina turned to look at her, the wonder in her Kalina's replaced by a dawning horror.

"How much... how much graescence?"

"Hmm?" Dia frowned in confusion. "It takes more skill than raw graescence," she said absently. "Besides, the acoustics are incredible here. It kinda gives this place its name."

Malek leaned his chair, tipping it back on two feet. "A whole gods forsaken warren, I'd bet."

"Pretty though," Moore said, still staring out over the balcony.

Dia's brow shot up. "Oh, you mean the platform?"

_Dozens, maybe hundreds of people pouring out their graescence every day. I shouldn't mention that..._

"Probably not as much as you think," Dia said cautiously. "That Elderin ring is expertly crafted."

Kalina bit her lip, then nodded slowly. Before she could speak, the waiter reappeared with a carafe of water and a stack of small plates, which he placed center table. Next he produced glass of crystal for each of them. Finally, he placed a basket of steaming hot-buns basted with herb butter.

Dia's eyes latched onto the bread, her stomach clenching painfully as the scents of yeast and herbs invaded her nose.

Kalina placed her hand on Dia's. "Dear, you're moaning."

"Sorry!" Dia blinked herself out her hunger-induced fugue, "Sorry, I haven't eaten since this morning."

"It is always a pleasure serving those who will appreciate our refreshments with such enthusiasm," the waiter said tactfully with a warm smile. He leaned over and winked at Dia. "I'll be sure to have another basket out shortly."

The waiter stood straight and dipped his head to the group, clasping his hands behind his back. "My name is Auren, and it will be my pleasure to serve you this evening. Before we begin, may I offer a cocktail or beverage of your choice? We have a stocked bar with a complete selection of local and imported craft beer, ale, and mead, along with a full compliment of wines. Our special this evening is a mango-infused gin martini."

Moore spoke first. "I'll take a bitter stout, as dark as you can find, barrel-aged if you've got it."

All three of them stared at Moore, their mouths ajar.

He shrugged. "What? I like beer."

"A man of distinguished taste," Auren said, sounding utterly delighted. "I think I know _just_ the stout for you."

Auren turned to Malek, raising a brow.

"Uh... ale?"

_Ah, and there he is, my eloquent muse._

Auren nodded politely, then shifted to Kalina.

"So the gin, is it sweet?"

"It is, but fair warning: it's quite strong."

"Perfect," Kalina purred.

Auren turned to Dia. "And for the lady?"

Dia hesitated, twisting her lips. Alcohol on an empty stomach would hit hard, yet it was almost rude not to drink in a place like this.

"A dry white, if you wouldn't mind. Something that would pair well with the fish I'm quite certain you'll offer soon."

Auren chuckled lightly. "Quite prudent, my lady. Before we move to the course, may I offer a selection of appetizers? As I'm sure you're aware, every meal is wild caught and cooked, prepared to order. A light repast may help take the edge off your fast."

"Please do."

"For this evening I make three offers: Rings of squid, fried in spiced cornmeal, topped with chives and paired with a light butter sauce. Toasted bread, topped with a scallop mango chutney and drizzled in a sweet wine reduction. Honeyed pears stuffed with a pecan cheese redolent and paired with a sharp mustard."

Dia glanced over at the others to gauge their interest, but their glazed and somewhat incredulous expressions told her most of what he said didn't stick.

She turned back to him. "The squid for certain— I've heard there's nothing quite like it, and I'm afraid I missed it on my last victual here."

_Mostly because mother was shoving me at some rich brat._

"Ah yes, it is certainly a popular option."

"And perhaps the pear?"

Auren nodded. "The pear is unique, and may be somewhat exotic for some. However, if I may be so bold to offer advice?"

He paused, giving Dia a chance to nod.

"The mustard cuts the cheese and pairs nicely with the honey. Without it the flavors don't quite resolve the way they should. If you do not care for mustard, then I'd recommend forgoing the pear."

Dia cast another glance toward the others and, at seeing their continued blank expressions, she lifted a shoulder.

"I do like mustard."

"Excellent!" Auren clapped once. "Then shall we move on to the main course?"

At Dia's consent, he detailed out a dizzying array of meals so that even Dia struggled to keep up. She began to pepper him with occasional questions, breaking up the flow and asking for clarification or occasionally where they sourced the ingredients. She didn't really need to know. It was a tactic she'd seen her mother use, interrupting purely for the sake of slowing down the onslaught.

How well it worked was debatable. Moore appeared to be politely listening— although he _always_ appeared to be listening —but Malek's eyes had glazed over. Kalina looked on the verge of panic, and Dia belatedly realized she thought she was supposed to memorize what he was saying.

_Oh, I really should have warned them._

Dia covertly reach over and squeezed her friend's hand.

As Auren wound down, he pulled out four tent cards with their choices handwritten in a neat, tight script. It didn't include all the verbal details, intended more as a reminder of what he'd said... assuming you'd been able to keep up.

"And unless there is anything else?" He took a second to meet each one's eyes. "I'll get your order started. Drinks will be out shortly, and the appetizers will follow."

He gave them a short bow, turned on heel, and walked out.

Kalina stared at the card in front of her, frowning.

"I've never heard you talk like this." Kalina said, her eyes still glued to the card.

"Like wha— oh," _like I belong here,_ "that's... just how you have to talk. It's... ummm—"

"Like a different world," Kalina whispered.

Dia shrugged, unsure of what to say.

"Wait wait, what did he mean 'wild caught and cooked'?" Malek asked.

"Oh, that's just their conceit, or one of them anyways."

Kalina looked up. "Conceit?"

"Like their special or their feature? Hmm, something they're known for. All of their seafood is wild caught moments before they cook it— supposed to be the freshest you can get."

Malek's eyes narrowed. "How?" he said slowly, asking the obvious question. They were in the middle of a mountain, after all.

"Oh, they have like some contract with the fishers to catch the seafood and keep it alive. They transport them in these big tubs, I guess, which get dumped into a bunch of pools— or that's what I was told, anyway. I've never seen it. It lets them grab 'wild seafood' without having to actually go fishing."

"That..." Kalina huffed, "just sounds like a lot of work."

Dia's brow climbed as she nodded sagely. "The seafood is really good here."

_Speaking of food..._ Dia reached out and grabbed one— nope, _two_ of the buns and put them on her plate.

"Oh they have a roast," Moore said suddenly, tapping the card in front of him.

Kalina screwed up her face at him. "Didn't she just say the seafood is best?"

"What? I like roast. And it says it's smoked."

"Everything here is good," Dia said as she brought a bun toward her. She breathed in deep, savoring the aroma, and took a bite.

She didn't even try to hide her groan of pleasure.

Kalina ignored Dia, her eyes locked intently on to Moore. "You can read."

Malek snorted. "Well, he tries anyway. Gonna fill our room with all those books."

"It's not _that_ many."

Dia froze mid chew. _She can't read. That's why she was staring at the card like that._

She began chewing slower as she processed the implications. Most people in the lower levels couldn't read, but it was easy to forget when it never really mattered. Or, not there at least. Here, though? Here it mattered. It was impossible to navigate life here without reading, and when they first moved here, Dia's parents had paid a tutor to catch her up but Kalina...

Kalina was looking increasingly uncomfortable, picking at her clothes in dissatisfaction, as though they'd betrayed her. Dia couldn't help but think of those dreams where you show up to a party only to realize you're naked. Kalina had found her dream, only to realize she didn't belong, couldn't belong, couldn't even try.

_I need to change that._

"Where did you get all those books any— no," Malek continued, ignorant of Kalina's growing trauma, "where did you _store_ them? It's not like the barracks have room."

Moore suddenly looked sheepish. "Oh... right. Well, under the stairs."

Malek blinked. "There's nothing under the stairs. I've cleaned there a hundred times."

"Well..."

Malek turned his full body toward Moore. "Spill it."

Moore sighed. "I guess it's fine now. There's two planks you can pry up where they meet the bottom of the stairs."

"That's it?"

"Yeah, you can store some stuff down— oh, I should tell Mia. She started collecting those creepy figurines."

"What about ME!?"

"Guys! Quiet!" Kalina hissed, "Do not embarrass me."

"What about me!?" Malek repeated, barely quieter than before as he leaned toward Moore, "You know, your _best friend?_"

Dia tuned out their argument and turned to Kalina.

"Do you..." Dia winced, "want me to read it to you?" _Gods, that sounded so patronizing._

Kalina tore her eyes from the arguing duo. Fury faded into horror, tears building at edges of her eyes, her breath shallow and quick.

_Oh no, that was the wrong thing to say. She's panicking— no no no. Not good— ah..._

"Here," Dia scooted her chair closer, "I was thinking about the sea bass," she tapped her card on the appropriate line, "but well, the salmon looks good too, although maybe it's too fishy?" Again she tapped on the card. "And the sea bass does have that garlic butter, which I've heard is divine. What do you think?"

"I..." Kalina paused, collecting herself, "do like the taste of salmon, though."

"Or there's the lobster!" Again, she tapped the card. "Although, did I ever tell you about that one time mom made me come here to meet a boy?"

Kalina scoffed, suddenly distracted, "No, really?"

_Of course boys would distract her._

"Yeah, it was horrible. I'm pretty sure the kid got the lobster only so he could break it in half in front of me, like he was some big bad man or something. No no! Really! Just snapped it in two, sending shell and butter and juice over... basically, everyone. His mother was mortified. His dad kept trying to give the kid hints or something, but gods his head was screwed on wrong cause _he kept doing it._ Over and over, shards of food flying everywhere. I'm half surprised he didn't get the crab too," tap tap, "just so he could have more food to break. Even the server was giving him looks."

Kalina broke into a smile and laughed, shaking her head. "Seriously?"

"Mmm hmm. And you wonder why I run away from my mom's parties. I ended up having a scallop pasta," tap tap, "but I just couldn't finish it, not after having to pick out pieces of lobster shell. The kid's father did have the roast," she gave Moore a look. Tap tap, "and he really seemed to enjoy it. Let's see... mom, of course, had to pick something socially acceptable, which means avoiding anything that would cause her embarrassment— she had popcorn shrimp," tap tap, "boring."

By the time Dia had finished, Kalina had shed her burgeoning panic and begun to relax. She wasn't naked at a party, and while her clothes weren't quite right, she hadn't made a fool of herself.

Besides, she had a friend, and perhaps that's all she really needed.

Auren arrived then, passing out their drinks and, blessedly, another basket of rolls. He straightened and again folded his arms behind him.

"Have we reached a consensus on our main course?"

To Dia's surprise, it was Kalina who spoke first.

"I've heard the lobster, while good, might be a bit ill-advised."

_You go, girl!_

Auren chuckled lightly. "Ah yes, the lobster. And perhaps the crab as well. If I may be so bold to boast a little, they are second to none. _However,_ many a social standing has suffered a notch or two at the attempt. I daresay it would be tragedy to mar such beauty as yours."

Kalina's face flushed at the compliment.

"I'll take the lobster," Malek said with an insufferably smug look on his face.

Everyone turned to look at him, which did nothing to abase his smug.

"Well," Auren said after a moment, "brave men do abound."

_Not sure 'men' is what he meant._

"The salmon for me," Kalina said.

"An excellent choice."

"And roast for me," Moore chimed in.

"A perfect compliment to the stout. May I ask your opinion of it? It is a somewhat new addition and you strike me as a man of taste."

A shy but small smile crept on Moore's face. _Huh, so not immune to flattery._ He picked up a glass filled with a black frothed liquid that looked thick enough to be its own meal.

_So gross._

He took a sip and eyes his flashed.

"That is... wow."

"Hard to describe?" The server leaned over conspiratorially as Moore nodded. "You did not hear this from me, but the brewer is actually based out of one of the warrens."

"Really?"

"It is, and though I cannot recall which one at present, I do know it's nearby."

Moore leaned back, a thoughtful look on his face while sipping his stout. Auren turned to Dia.

"And for you, my lady?"

"I'll take the sea bass."

"Another excellent choice."

_They're all excellent, and I almost wish I could say that with sarcasm._

"Now if— ah." He glanced at the wine Dia hadn't touched yet. He winced. "I'm afraid I've made an error. That wine will not pair with the bass in quite the way I'd hoped.""

"Oh? Oh no, that's fine."

"However, it should be quite the compliment to the pear. So how about we call it on the house, and I'll bring out a wine much more suited to your entree."

"You really don't have to do that."

"You would be doing me a favor if you would allow it. Call it a matter of personal pride."

Dia pressed her lips into a smile and nodded.

"Excellent! If that will be all?" The server once again scanned the group, briefly touching each of their eyes. "I will get started on the entree, and your appetizers will be out shortly."

And with that he was gone.

"Oh he's good," Kalina said, watching the man walk away.

"They only hire the best." Dia looked at Moore and Malek. "I thought you two were getting separate flats."

"Well," Malek dithered, "we looked at them and... just... didn't—."

"Too big."

Kalina scrunched her face a Moore. "What do you mean 'too big'?"

"Pretty sure that's impossible." Dia nodded. "Besides, I thought the flats were small?"

Moore shrugged. "Gotta fill all that space. Takes money. It's too empty and..."

"Empty?" Dia said, struggling to comprehend the issue.

"And?" Kalina raised her brow.

Malek and Moore looked at each other for a few moments before Moore shrugged.

Malek rolled his eyes and threw up his hands. "We've never slept alone, okay. It feels... weird.""

"Wait..." Kalina flashed a predatory grin. "Are you afraid of the dark?"

"Oh come on, it's not like that!"

Her eyes went wide in delight. "You ARE!"

Malek got a stubborn look on his face, but Moore broke in before he could think of a retort.

"It's too quiet."

"Too quiet?" Dia said. _How is that a thing?_

Malek turned back to Dia, wagging his head. "We've been sleeping on a cot in a room with thirty people for our whole lives. So yeah, it's too quiet."

Moore nodded his agreement. "Hard to sleep without his snoring."

"I do not snore," Malek protested, shaking his head.

"It's a very consistent sound."

"I don't snore!" He glared at Moore. "That's just a rumor Toren spread because he's an asshole."

"Malek, we know it's you. It's not even a question."

"I. don't. snore. You'll see."

"Hope not, cause it helps me sleep."

Malek shook his head and leaned back in his chair, clearly disgruntled. Then, realizing he'd left his ale untouched, he leaned over, grabbed it, leaned back, and took a huge gulp. His eyes widened, looking at the glass with appreciation.

Kalina, nursing her gin, turned to Dia with a sly smile.

"I give it less than a year before they're married."

"Hey!"

"Married?" Dia exaggerated confusion. "I thought they were already married; I was betting on their divorce."

Kalina chortled and raised her glass. "To our favorite married couple!"

"Come on!"

Dia grabbed her wine and clinked it against hers, only to be surprised when a third glass joined.

They all looked over at Moore, though Malek was scowling at the betrayer.

"What?" he chuckled, "I like a good roast."

"Well then," Dia said, "may your days be long and merry, and your nights filled with endless snoring."

"And may your divorce be filled with fireworks and drama!" Kalina flashed her eyes, concluding the toast.

They all took a drink. Even Malek, however reluctantly, and muttering something about needing new friends.

Auren returned again, delivering their appetizer and another round of drinks for everyone but Dia, who'd only taken a sip of her wine. He collected the empty bread baskets and left.

Dia took a few piece of the squid along with a full half-pear. She cut off a piece of the pear, dipped it in the mustard, and took a bite.

_Oh, that's good._

Kalina plated her own portions. When she was done, Malek pulled the entire plate of fried squid over to his side of the table. Kalina levelled a glare at him, which he studiously ignored as he began to chew on the squid with exaggerated motions.

Their silence gave way to the music as they ate. After some time, Malek turned to Moore, speaking in low tones that Dia couldn't hear. Kalina turned to Dia.

"So what made you come?"

"Hmm?" Dia hummed through her mouth as she chewed.

"Well, you were all like," she dropped her voice into a low whine, "'I'm sooo tired' and 'I've gotta play with my new toy' and 'This thing is soooooo heavy' and—"

Dia swallowed quickly. "Okay okay! I get it."

She took a sip of wine, then grabbed a bite of the fried squid. Then she grabbed another— they were really good.

"Well?"

Dia finished chewing, then sighed dramatically. "Honestly? You were looking so sad, so _pathetic_ that I realized," Dia shook her head slowly, "you were lost without me. And what kind of person would leave their friend to wander around Ocuras with only a brute and fool to guide her and—"

"Your mom threw another party, didn't she?"

"Oh gods Kali, you should have heard her. It was so... so... well, I don't have the words. She'd arranged for me to meet yet another boy— I mean, why does she think I'd ever pander to being sold like chattel?""

"I dunno. It could be fun."

Dia's face flattened. "Lobster." She mimed breaking one in half.

"Obviously, there's gonna be a few duds." Kalina glanced over at Malek, who was dropping fried squid into his mouth from above, the butter drooling down his cheek. "Or... gods, okay, so maybe more than a few." She tore her eyes from the scene to look back at Dia. "But you never know, one of them could end up being a perfect soul mate."

"You mean a _rich_ soul mate."

"Isn't that what I said? Nothing wrong with rich."

Dia snorted. "I told her I'd made friends with the snobs at school and that my 'condition' was from some stupid hazing ritual."

"She bought that?"

"Buy it? She _embraced_ it. Starting telling me how to create my own click by bribing the 'out girls'. She wanted me to manipulate them to rise to the top and gain power from other... people? I don't know, I'd tuned her out at that point."

"Yeah, that's a little messed up."

"She even left me a stack of Rocs to buy gifts so the other girls would like me. I mean, _who does that!?_"

Kalina blinked slowly. "Well?"

"Well what?"

"Where's my bribe?"

Dia had to resist the urge to stick her tongue out. She settled for a glare, which Kalina blithely ignored.

"You know, Dia, I'm not sure we're really friends. How could we be when you've never bribed— oh gods below," she suddenly snapped, turning on the boys, "would you stop that!?"

Dia looked over and saw Moore holding a piece of fried squid between two fingers, poised to throw it in Malek's wide open mouth. Malek looked like a baby bird with his head tipped back.

Moore flinched, looking guilty while he slowly lowered the squid and placed it in the middle of his small plate. Having not heard Kalina's exclamation, Malek kept his head tilted back for several more seconds.

"Hey! Where's my— ohhhkay. We may have taken that too far."

"You _think?_ I swear, if you ruin this for me I will—"

"Kalina," Dia tried to interrupt.

"—personally fillet that shrivelled little twig you call a—"

"Kalina!"

"_What?_" she almost shouted.

"Food's here."

Kalina's eyes went wide. She jerked her head toward the server, who'd sat the tray of food on a foldable stand and was patiently waiting with his arms folded behind him. His face maintained a carefully controlled neutral expression. Very, very carefully controlled. His lip was twitching and Dia was pretty sure he'd bitten his cheek.

At the group's attention he began to hand out entrees as Kalina tried to shrink into her seat, her face red.

Auren detailed a summary of each meal as he placed it down. When he got to Malek, though, he hesitated. He'd placed both a warm cloth and additional tools alongside the lobster, and Dia could see just how much he wanted to explain how to use them. Yet to do so would be a social breach, perhaps even an insult to some, and so the man continued on, displaying a truly prodigious degree of self control.

Just as he was reaching for Dia's entree, a woman dressed in a hostess's garb rushed up to Auren and whispered in his ear. His eyes flashed concern, then immediately smoothed out.

"Is everything okay," Dia asked as the woman rushed off.

"Oh, nothing of concern. Just a small incident in the kitchen."

Dia nodded, a small frown on her face.

_A kitchen incident? Yeah, no. I'm sure they're running around cause someone spilled the soup._

A small paranoid part of Dia's mind insisted the kitchen incident would somehow, someway completely ruin their dinner. She had no idea how, but it fit too perfectly with her day.

_Not that I can do anything about it,_ so she dismissed it from her mind.

The server finished by handing out another round of drinks, including a new white for Dia, and collecting used glassware. Dia began to immediately start sipping hers.

"Before I leave you to your victual, may I just say that it truly is one of life's greatest pleasures to see one's food consumed with such... passion."

Kalina buried her head into her hands and groaned.

Dia saw a grin spread across Auren's face as he turned away, carrying with impossible grace a tray stacked with empty dishes.

_Oh, he's getting a good tip._

A loud crack drew Dia's attention to Malek, who had taken the lobster and... properly used pliers to crack open a claw. She stared at him in disbelief as he carefully set down the pliers, picked up a spreader, and used them to leverage open the chitin. With the meat exposed, he then grabbed a wickedly forked spoon to spear the meat and extract it in a smooth motion. He dipped it into butter, then tapped the edge twice to dislodge the excess. He popped the buttered piece into his mouth, chewing slowly, relishing the flavor.

_What in the frozen hells is going on?_

"_Where_ did you learn to do that?" Kalina said with suspicion and accusation in her voice.

Malek looked up and, practically radiating conceit, he graced Kalina with a polite smile before returning to his food. Moore began chuckling as he cut into his roast. Kalina and Dia turned their gaze at him, expectantly waiting. He paused mid-cut and frowned at his knife. He set it down and pulled at the meat with his fork, watching it flake off with admiration.

"Good," he said, "real good."

"Right," Dia rolled her eyes and turned to Kalina. "Did they find your dad yet?"

Kalina jerked, her face falling into sorrow.

_Oh no. No no no, please no. He can't be dead— it's never that quick. And yet..._ sometimes it was.

Dia took Kalina's hand in her own. "I am _so_ sorry, Kali. I'll— you can come stay with me. Okay? Mom'll make a fuss but honestly, I think she'll like you more than me anyway. And you cannot stay in your flat, not after... after. Just no. I won't let you, not alone like—"

"Dia, what are you talking about?" Kalina interrupted, utterly baffled.

"You're dad, he's..." She couldn't bring herself to say it. Tears edged in on her vision, blurring everything.

"He's not dead, Dia!" Kalina's eyes flashed. "Just... gods!"

Kalina jerked her hand back and pressed her fingers into her forehead.

"Whaaa...?"

"They won't let her see him," Moore said between bites.

Dia felt the adrenaline swirl out through a hole in her stomach, again. She deflated as a wave of exhaustion assaulted her, again. She pulled her elbows to the table and slowly dropped her head into the palms of her hands.

_This day needs... to... end._

"I'm sorry, Kalina," she said through her fingers. "It's just, with way you reacted? I thought..."

"They locked him in a room," Kalina replied quietly, "all padded to keep him from hurting himself."

Dia peeked over her fingers. "He'll live, right? I mean, it hasn't been that long."

"Yeah. Yeah, of... course," Kalina replied, her voice shaking. "Can we not talk about it?"

"No! I mean, yeah, that's fine."

Dia speared her fish, pulled off a piece, and chewed it mechanically. They ate in silence a perfectly cooked meal made with some of the best ingredients and spices in the world, a meal that tasted of ash.

Or, well, the girls did at least. The other side of the table hadn't even paused in their hedonistic consumption.

Dia had finished almost half her meal and was giving serious thought to how much stomach pain was worth another bite, when a commotion drew her attention to the floor's exit.

Her eyes widened at the sight of a man rushing down the stairs two to three at time, coming dangerously close to tripping and falling down the stairs. Behind him were a pair of guards struggling to keep up at a pace less prone to bodily harm.

The man was wearing disheveled clothes that belonged to the warrens. He stood out like dirt smeared on crystal, gasps of horror and outrage following in his wake.

Yet that wasn't what caught Dia's attention. The man was familiar, and not just because he was the one stalking them from before. No, it was his eyes that sent a shiver of dread curdling in her stomach.

She knew those eyes; they stared at her in hate every time she closed her own.

The man ran straight toward them, using the table to stop himself as he stumbled. Kalina squawked out her surprise, drawn from her funk by the loud noise. Moore stood and put a hand on his shoulder.

"Hey, you alright?"

"No!" He slapped Moore's hand away, panting, "where... is... he?"

"Woah, calm down there."

"I can't! They won't le—"

Two pairs of hands grabbed the man, spinning him around.

"You're coming wi— bah!"

Dia's brow shot up as the man decked one of the guards, sending him sprawled out on the floor.

Three whole seconds passed while everyone, including the man, stared at the unconscious guard in shock.

"Did he just—" Kalina began.

"No!" the man spun toward Kalina, "_where is he?_"

"Who!? What are you talking about you crazed psycho!"

"My son, you gods damned bitch!"

"_Bitch!?_" Kalina sputtered, rising to her feet.

"You're Dia, right? He said he was going with you. I remember; I heard your name."

Dia shrunk into her seat even more.

"Dia?" Kalina said, completely nonplussed. "No, I'm not..."

Her eyes flickered toward Dia, and the motion was not missed. The man, Tait's father, turned to Dia, desperation in his eyes.

"Please," he pleaded, "Blackwater won't tell me, and I know you were there. Just... just where is he. Where's my son? He hasn't come home, and he always comes home. _Please,_ I just wanna see my son."

Dia stared at the man's eyes and saw desperation clinging to a frayed rope. His eyes merged with his son's, intermingling hate and desperation as the blood drained from Dia's face, leaving it pasty. Her tongue absently tried to push out blood that wasn't there. Her breath slowed imperceptible, while her heart stopped altogether.

Tait's father disappeared suddenly, obscured behind two trunk-like arms that sought to tackle him into the floor. Yet even as the man was sent plummeting he twisted, and it was the guard who found his head bouncing against a thin carpet backed by stone.

"Fuckin' cunt!" the man screamed, kicking the guard's head so that it bounced up from the floor. "I own a fucking bar! Do you think I can't _fight!?_"

Moore took a step back, then another, then meekly lowered himself into his seat. Dia couldn't blame him in the least. If anything, she was beginning to wish she could disappear into the floor, if such a thing were possible.

Tait's father turned from the guard to Dia, his eyes intense, set on hers, boring into her head. He walked slowly, a stalking predator affixed. Placing his hands firmly on the table, he lowered himself until his eyes levelled with her.

And she couldn't look away. They drew her in, desperation, hate, accusation, judgment, condemnation, all merged into eyes that would never let her rest, never let her sleep.

"Where. is. my. so— urghfl!"

Fingers wrapped around the man's throat, each finger places precisely, digging into trachea and carotid. Another hand snake around his arm, first pulling then pinning it in place behind his back. Tait's father jerked, and his free arm reflexively grabbed at the hand. Yet no matter how he pried, the fingers remained firmly entrenched. He tried to reach back and punch, then tried to smack, and finally just waved about randomly as oblivion slowly consumed him.

Auren stood straight, folding arms behind him as Tait's father fell unconscious from his grasp.

"How deeply unfortunate," he said in an even voice, eyes looking on the man with disappointment.

Half a dozen guards suddenly appeared, as though waiting for the moment to conclude. Dia knew they'd been rushing down the stairs, barely a minute behind the first two. Yet it'd felt like an eternity, their appearance conveniently too late.

Auren eyed the guard as they surrounded the fallen man, his brow raised with a look of mild distaste.

He turned to Dia and in less than a moment his expression had shifted from distaste to genuine concern. The expression was so authentic, so real, and yet so sudden that the unnaturalness sent a shock of terror through Dia.

If Tait's father was the stalking predator, this man was its claws wrapped around your throat the moment death claimed you.

"I cannot apologize enough for allowing this..." he glanced the unconscious man now being dragged away, lip curled, "...refuse from disturbing you. As recompense, you will pay nothing for your time here."

"No you don't need to—"

"Moreover, I have placed all four of you on Echoes' _permanent_ guest list."

Dia went still in shock. Echoes guest list was famous, guaranteeing anyone on it a table no matter what, even if they had to kick out another group to accommodate you. It was an honor not even many Royal's had attained, and their _server_ just put them on it? And for something that was arguably their fault, even if only partially?

_They should be kicking us out._

"Thank... you?"

"Of course," the predator spoke genteel, "it's the least I could do."

And Dia believed him.
