# 82 | Scout

Roland knelt in the snow and looked closely at a series of tracks that had pushed and spread the white powder out until it looked remarkably like a dried river bank. The morning light cast sharp shadows on the ground that made it easy to discern the patterns. The day was cold, clear, and sharp without even a hint of a breeze. It was, in all, a nice day to scout.

“See something?” Jonah said.

He was a quiet leader, one that never raised his voice, yet somehow always managed to be heard. He had a patient air to him that somehow both gave Roland motivation to succeed while yet providing room to fail. Roland had never met such a man before, but he thought he could lead thousands without any effort by merely yielding that powerful, quiet voice. Not for the first time did he wonder just what had driven such a man into the Whitewood forest.

“Tracks.” He was still working through them, teasing out their individual stories until he had a full picture of what these tracks conveyed.

Jonah grunted affably but said nothing further. It was yet another attribute of his Roland had come to appreciate. He seemed to innately understand when you needed more time, and he felt no need to press you, instead choosing to trust you about your own business. It seemed a truly rare trait for a leader, or for anyone.

Roland continued to tease apart the story. He leaned over and sniffed but wrinkled his nose at the wet dog smell that permeated the tracks. Jackrets, of course, and their smell covered up the scent he’d aimed to discern. He leaned back and reexamined the tracks. The pacing told Roland they’d been in full flight, but it was careless and haphazard. Not stalking then. They were running from something and cared not at all for the noise they’d made by the way each foot had kicked up the snow.

Another, larger pair of cat-like tracks overlaid on top of the jackrets. The animal had moved quickly, pressing deep into the snow for its size but not kicking it up in the least. It was a predator’s gate, sure-footed of a certain kill. The Jackrets didn’t concern him much, not anymore, but these larger tracks worried him. He’d seen them before, even hunted their kind once.

He sat back on his haunches and worked his memory. He was reasonably certain he knew what animal it was, but it had been a long time since he’d hunted it. If he was right, it answered quite a few questions about the camp’s survival. But arriving at a convenient answer from a guess was worse than not having an answer at all.

There was one sure way to know, so he followed the trail, making sure to stay far enough away that he wouldn’t disturb it. He had to resist the urge to pull him up on the trees to gain a better vantage, one he was more familiar with. Trudging and pushing through the snow was mostly a foreign experience to him now, and he felt a growing frustration as the sheer slowness of it all.

He stopped abruptly at a fresh trail that crossed the large one he’d been following. He frowned as he worked to tease out its story. It was incongruous with everything he knew. Whatever it was, it was neither fleeing, stalking, hiding, or giving chase. The trail seemed haphazardly made, as though the creature didn’t care whether it made noise, nor possessed of fear for other predators. Yet it didn’t seem large enough to warrant such arrogance.

Roland continued to analyze the new tracks until the obvious came to focus. He groaned, looked up, and followed the new tracks to where Fin leaned back against a tree as he looked out into the forest. He had one foot propped up against it, while he’d fished out some kind of wooden implement, gravtech by the looks of it, and seemed to be applying it to the front of a rolled-up piece of paper he held gently between two fingers.

“What?” he said as he noticed both Roland and Fin looking at him in annoyance.

Neither of them replied, so he returned his attention to his rolled-up paper and applied the wooden implement to it until smoke rose from the tip. He brought the paper to his lips, drew in a deep breath from it, and held it in. Finally, he released it slowly with a small smile.

Roland’s expression flattened. How was that man still alive?

Fin stiffened and looked back at them defensively. “What?”

Jonah shook his head. “Perhaps if you’d pay attention, you might learn something to keep us all alive out here.”

Fin snorted and relaxed into the tree behind him. Jonah continued to stare until Fin rolled his eyes and pushed off. He took another deep drag and sauntered back.

Roland turned to Jonah. “Why didn’t you bring a tracker?”

The question had been bothering him the whole morning. A tracker that knew how to decipher tracks would have been invaluable to any expedition. Maybe they’d brought one, and he’d been killed, but Roland doubted it. Someone that valuable would have been protected.

Doubt registered briefly on Jonah’s face before he turned the question about. “Is that what you were to your last expedition?”

Roland realized his mistake too late. If he’d been on an expedition, he’d have known the answer. He stared back at Jonah for a moment while unease wormed its way into his stomach. He was lying to these people, and Jonah knew it. But the only alternative to lying was to leave, and he wouldn’t do that.

Again, he figured the less he said, the better, so he shrugged instead. Jonah looked at him a moment more but didn’t pry.

“It’s been tried, but even should we find a tracker willing to come here, they’d be worse than useless. Trackers need to know their environment, or all their conclusions may be wrong. Without knowing the animals, they can’t know which ones are dangerous, and so they make bad decisions. Expeditions that rely on them never come back. No one even tries anymore.”

Roland looked back at the tracks and realized Jonah was right. One could easily mistake the tracks for a pack of dogs being chased by an enormous cat. Dangerous for sure but not to a group of people. If Roland was correct, this predator was beyond dangerous. Figuring it for anything less would be the last mistake anyone would make.

Fin wandered in and leaned over. “So, what is it?”

Roland ignored him and began following the tracks again while trying his best to ignore the sound of the man crashing behind him, at least until the sound of the crashing changed after a few paces. Roland turned back and realized Fin was following _in_ the original tracks Roland had so carefully kept undisturbed.

He gave the man a nasty glare.

“What?” Fin whined.

Jonah motioned with his head for Fin to get behind him. Fin looked disgruntled but did it anyway.

It was almost a hundred paces before Roland found what he’d been looking for. While the Jackret tracks continued on, the tracks of the animal chasing them stopped suddenly. Roland carefully walked over to the last imprint, knelt down, and felt the depression left by the animal. It was much deeper than the others, compressing the snow so that it felt like glassed ice. Almost a full double-pace from the imprint was another, mirrored track pressed just as hard into the snow.

Jonah knelt down to examine it with a confused expression on his face. “Where’d it go?”

Roland looked up into the tree branches until he saw what he was looking for. High above was a tree limb missing some snow from a branch. It wasn’t much, barely more than a couple scuff marks, and it would have been impossible to notice without snow to mark its passing, but it was there. He had no doubt that further down the path, he would find more disturbed branches. He pointed.

Fin released a slow whistle. “Now that is one hell of a jump.”

“Gravics.”

They both turned to look at him, and seeing the question on their faces, Roland replied, “All creatures in this forest use gravics in some fashion or another.”

Fin’s eyes widened in surprise, but Jonah just nodded as though he’d expected something like this.

“All of them?” Fin looked horrified.

Roland nodded. “The ones that don’t become food. Nothing without gravics wouldn’t last long here.”

“So, what is it?”

“Sabre.”

Fin opened up his hands, trailing a line of smoke that slowly drifted into the air, while he screwed up his face in question. Roland caught a whiff of the smoke for the first time and was surprised to find it cloyingly sweet with hints of some kind of strong spice. He winced at how many animals must be able to smell something like that, then turned to stare at the tracks.

“A Sabre is mostly a night hunter. It might be better to say it’s an opportunistic hunter, but since it excels at night, that’s when it usually chooses to hunt. It will normally stalk its prey on the ground but moves into the trees for the kill, choosing to come at its prey from an angle they don’t expect. Its offensive capabilities are limited to sharp claws and teeth with no real gravic offense. Instead, it uses gravics to enhance its motion, allowing it to move in great bursts of speed or else take large leaps. It may also use gravics to silence its approach, making it one of the most deadly stalkers in the forest. Its agility and mobility are its greatest assets and...”

Roland trailed off as he realized almost every word he’d spoken had been Rose’s, given to him when he’d first hunted the thing years ago. It had never occurred to him just how easily he’d memorized each hunt.

“And?”

He turned back to them and blinked away his thoughts. “And it’s most likely what has been hunting your expedition.”

Jonah looked at Roland sharply. “Are you sure?”

“It fits the pattern of your losses, probably views your expedition as a food source. You keep sending out small scouting parties, just large enough for a meal.”

“You mean a person,” Fin said.

“What?”

“A person. A person is a meal. A scouting _party_ is not a meal.”

“No, it would take a couple people to fill its stomach, and the rest to save for later.”

Fin stared at him. “That a big fucking cat.”

Jonah looked at Fin curiously. “How do you know its a cat?”

Fin shrugged but pointed at the tracks. Roland was a little impressed the man could recognize the tracks at all. The sabre was very cat-like, though, and so as far as that went, Fin was right.

He paused at the irony. He should never utter those words where Ellie could hear them.

“Why not us?” Fin looked around nervously and scanned the shadows. He looked jumpy, then took another long drag.

Roland considered the question a moment. “Luck maybe and you last scouted into the center of a linrix’s territory. It would avoid that for easier prey, or perhaps prey smarter than to trounce around such a dangerous area.”

Fin did not look like he appreciated the analysis.

“Oh, and probably Stan. Most creatures here seem to be able to sense those with strong gravic affinities. The sabre would have also avoided Stan for easier prey, at least until it had no other choice.”

Fin looked like he appreciated that even less.

“Let’s get back to the others,” Jonah said, “I don’t like being separated with that kind of predator about.”

Roland doubted the sabre would attack now, but he had the motivation to turn around. Sabre’s often took to the trees when they were ready to attack. Following the trail, only a few dozen paces more would likely lead to a large blood bath that he doubted would do the others any good to see. They’d suffered enough than to have that particular visual assault their dreams.

The three of them began to head back to where they’d left Stan and Anna. Fin jumped over to the packed ridge into the trail left by the Jackrets, and Roland had to hold himself back from scolding the man. It annoyed him to see Fin destroying the trail. It was like he’d carelessly tracked dirt into a clean home.

Roland turned his attention to the sabre as they walked. Clearly, it had been using the expedition as a food source, which, in a fit of irony, would explain how they survived so long. It had defended them if only so it could eat them later. With only one scouting party left containing two shapers now, it was likely the sabre would start picking people off the main camp, taking one or two whenever it got hungry.

Stan might be able to defeat it. He didn’t know the man’s abilities, but he suspected they were significant. Of course, he’d be the sabre’s first target when the time came, and he doubted Stan would ever see it coming.

A sloshing sound drew him out of thoughts. He turned to see Fin draw up beside him, but where he was carefully lifting each foot out of the snow, Fin was dragging his feet.

“Hey, let’s not mention that to Stan, eh?”

“Mention what?”

“Oh, you know, the whole beast avoiding him because he’s powerful thing. You know that man has a head too big for himself.”

Roland snorted and felt the corners of his mouth rise. Fin’s head surely dwarfed Stan’s by a fair margin.

“I’m serious, man. Hey, hey, consider this. We don’t want him to go _after_ the sabre and get killed, right? And just because he thought he could take it. No, that’d be horrible. We’ll just say it was luck that we survived so long.”

Roland snorted at the twisted logic that somehow managed to make sense. The two of them had some kind of rivalry going that mostly broke down into bickering, but he wouldn't put it past them to do something stupid just to prove the other one wrong. It was amusing as long as they didn’t try to drag him into it.

“No seriously—”

Roland threw up placating hands. “Ok, ok, fine. I won’t mention it.”

Fin nodded thoughtfully. “Thanks, yeah... it’s for the best.”

Roland returned to his thoughts as Fin fell back. In some ways, he was lucky. Bait for his prey had already been set. All he needed now was to find it. Perhaps he could slip out at night, hunt and kill it, then return without notice. He snorted. Unlikely. Last time he hunted a Sabre, it took days to find it even after he found the trail.

“There you are,” Anna said as they broke into the clearing they'd left a couple hours earlier.

Stan sat on a large stone on the ground, eyes closed, and he appeared to be meditating. As if that were not weird enough, all the snow had been pushed out into a perfect circle with a radius of several paces with Stan seated dead center. Also, Roland was pretty sure that stone hadn’t been naturally in the center like that or that dry.

Anna was seated by a tree, her back leaning against it as she used one of her knives to clean her fingers. Similar to Stan, the snow had been pushed out in a semi-circle from where she rested.

“Show off,” Fin muttered to Stan as they walk by. Stan opened his eyes and flashed Fin a smile before looking to Roland and Jonah.

“Find anything?”

Jonah nodded. “Our killer.”

“Kill it?”

“Perhaps I should say we found out what kind of beast our killer is.”

Anna had walked and placed herself right next to Roland. She’d lightly brushed his shoulder as she walked up, but he couldn’t be certain she’d done it on purpose. He glanced over and thought he caught the slightest smile on her lips. He lost himself in those lips for just a moment.

“It hunts at night and eats scouting parties as a meal,” Fin said in a wry tone.

“We already knew that,” Stan said as he got up. “Question is, what do we do about it?”

Fin gave Stan a sour look and turned to Jonah for answers. Roland was glad they didn’t turn to him.

“We need to head back,” Jonah said firmly. “According to our resident expert, the sabre hunts at night, so we make sure we’re back well before dusk. We know it ate last night, so we have some time to prepare.” He turned to Roland. “Do you know of any traps that might work for something like the Sabre?”

Roland raised his eyebrows and nodded, impressed Jonah had thought of using traps at all. As he did, he caught Jonah narrowing his eyes slightly at the response. It was gone so quickly that Roland wasn’t sure he’d noticed anything at all.

“Good. Until we catch this thing, I’m suspending our scouting activities. We’ll head back to camp and work on a way to catch the sabre.”

Fin started sputtering and made to speak while Jonah forestalled him with uplifted hands, but it was Stan who made the reply.

“Fin, surely even you must appreciate how much easier it will be to scout without a _party eating monster_ hunting us?”

Fin opened his mouth, but nothing came out, and he slowly closed it, scrunching up his face as though he swallowed something sour. He shot Stan an acid look that only seemed to brighten Stan’s disposition. Clearly, Stan won the round.

Jonah turned to Roland. “I would like you and me to work on creating the necessary traps. We’ll work on them a few hours each day. The rest of the time, I’d like you to teach Fin and Anna what you can about tracking and surviving out here.”

Jonah motioned for them to begin walking but held Roland back. Anna brushed by Roland and caused his heart to lurch. She had to be doing it on purpose.

After the others had opened the distance by a dozen paces, Jonah and Roland began walking. As usual, Jonah didn’t speak immediately. Roland might have felt nervous and even thought maybe that he should, yet the way Jonah wore the silence set him at ease.

He’d never considered the different types of silence that might exist. But where Rose so often used it as a weapon, a way to drive in some point or lapse of judgment on Roland’s part, Jonah used it as a way to build rapport. It was yet another aspect he was beginning to love about the man.

“When we first saw you, I didn’t know what to think,” Jonah spoke into the silence between them, his eyes ahead on the path. “We offered succor to what appeared a most unlikely survival by a scared and emaciated boy.”

He trailed off for a minute, looking thoughtful.

“Then you displayed unprecedented skill with a blade, skill of the like I’ve never seen. And don’t let him fool you. Fin may be a blowhard, but he’s one of the best out there, taught by a true master. And you weren’t even breathing hard at his defeat.”

He spoke each statement separately as though tasting each one. Roland got the sense he was trying to put them together as clues to make a picture whole.

“Today, you displayed an intimate knowledge of the beasts in this forest, their capabilities, weaknesses, how to track, and how to trap them. These are not the skills of a boy merely surviving.”

They continued on in silence for a few minutes as Roland felt torn between telling Jonah everything and simply running away. He feared what he might have divined already from the shreds of clues he’d gathered.

Would Rose kill them because they knew too much? Did it matter when the other option was to leave them to the sabre?

“Look at them.” Jonah motioned toward Stan, Anna, and Fin ahead. “They put on a brave face, but it’s death’s humor. The forest _terrifies_ them, and they believe they’re going to die.”

Fin jumped to the forefront of his mind. The man wanted to scout more, go further, find the larger trees. He’d assumed it was for greed alone, and yet what good was greed when one was a moment from death? Why search them out then? Perhaps the man was greedy, but Roland doubted it was so much for the money as it was for life. He wanted to see and experience as much of the forest as he could.

“But you stride through the forest as though it were your own, as though _you_ are the most dangerous thing here. At first, I thought it bravado, but now I’m not so sure. You wear the mantle as though you’ve earned it. The only time I’ve seen you show true fear was when you first came upon our camp.”

He went quiet for a time as they walked. For once, Roland felt the silence as a heavy thing that carried dread of what came next. He liked Jonah and respected him, but he was trying to pry open forbidden truths. He felt trapped between a desire to share everything with his new friends and a deep terror at that same idea.

“How long have you been here?”

Roland clenched his jaw. “I don’t know.”

“You don’t know or won’t say?”

“I don’t know.” His fist clenched unconsciously. “All the years have blurred together.”

“But years?”

Roland nodded.

“That must mean you’ve trained here as well, as impossible as that sounds.”

Jonah looked over for confirmation for the first time. There seemed no point to deny it, but Roland would offer nothing more than what he could deduce. And no matter how intelligent he was, Roland doubted the man would ever figure that some immortal woman was training him, or that he was a godling. He gave a small, almost imperceptible nod, but it was enough, and Jonah returned his attention to the path ahead, a frown on his face.

They continued in silence, each to their own thoughts for several minutes until Jonah finally spoke. “And still, you would help us?”

Roland stopped suddenly and turned to Jonah in confusion. “Why wouldn’t I?”

“Because you’re a stranger, and you don’t know us or owe us anything.”

Roland stared at him a moment, thoughts spinning. He turned and without a word, began to walk. Jonah watched him for a moment before catching up. They continued for a time, silent, as Roland tried to understand his own thoughts. Jonah was right. He owed these people nothing. And yet, for all that they needed him, he couldn’t help but feel as though he needed them far, far more. There was no way for him to say this, though, even should he come upon the words to express it.

“The sabre was protecting you.”

Jonah looked over, his face screwed up with a startled, disbelieving look.

“You were an excellent source of food, so it protected you, fought for you.”

Jonah stopped suddenly and closed his eyes. He looked sick.

“I’ve never seen an expedition this deep.” He’d never seen one at all.

“So death’s grip is tight then, tighter than we imagined. I’d had thought... hoped.” He took a deep breath. “But if what you’re saying is true, even should we kill it, we’d only find a quicker road to death.”

“Not necessarily.”

“No?” A tentative hope laced his voice.

“The forest can be navigated safely if you know how.”

“Like you do?”

Roland nodded and turned to continue, but Jonah reached out and grabbed his shoulder. It took every effort of willpower he had to keep himself from flinching.

“You will always be welcome here, with me, and with these people.” He gestured down the path where the rest of them had pulled far ahead. “I can offer you little else but friendship and gratitude, but for what it’s worth, it’s yours.”

He squeezed Roland’s shoulder with an intense look. He then turned and left Roland staring at the snow as he desperately struggled to contain his tears.
