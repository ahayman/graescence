# 76 | Flight

The wind howled and pressed a kind of cold into his bones he hadn't thought possible. His body refused to stop shivering, and when he touched his face, he felt ice.

He must have sweat during the night. The nightmares, probably, but he couldn't recall them. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to clear his mind.

His shield had collapsed, but he was still alive for now. The sun was probably well up, but he wouldn't see it for hours, hidden as he was in the mountain's shadow.

He threw up a shield against the wind, reseated himself into a meditative position, and spent the next hour working on his cycle. It was time lost, but he couldn't give it up. He needed the calm and clarity it brought as well as the strength of body it lent.

He needed to stop shivering. He needed to climb. He wasn't sure which one would come first.

He stuffed more jerky down his throat, swallowed a bit of water, re-stuffed his pack, and redied his climbing picks.

He would need to find the Linrix today, or else give up the hunt. He didn't think he could survive another night on the mountain. Already, he began to wonder if perhaps he'd already climbed too high for the Linrix. Maybe he should have spent more time looking at the base of the mountain, but finding a single prey on an entire mountain suddenly seemed like an impossible undertaking for a single hunt.

He sighed and readied his pick.

Push energy, pull the pick, strike, release energy, pull himself up, and repeat. Over and over, again and again, he passed the hours in a rhythmic cadence that invited the mind to distraction.

How was it he could be so far up, one slip from death, and he was still somehow mind-numbingly bored?

He forced himself to stop frequently to scan for likely locations of a nest, often on ledges that barely could be called such, but he needed the break from monotony.

After every stop, his doubts intensified.

This wasn't like tracking in the forest, where he could cover ground, collect clues, and follow trails. There were no clues here, no trails to follow, and he'd hardly covered the mountain at all. He'd need another several months to go over a single mountain.

His only consolation was that he did find an occasional cave or at least a crack that led into one. Most of them harbored nothing, but their presence gave him hope. At the very least, he could use one of them for shelter at night should the search take too long, which seemed increasingly likely.

Eventually, the sun peeked over the top of the mountain and cast the cliffs into sharp contrasts of light and shadow. Ironically, this made the climb even more perilous as the shadows became indiscernible inkblots. Half the time, he didn't know if his pick would strike rock or air, so he tended to keep himself on the warmed stone instead.

A flicker of shadow pulled his attention.

The sky was a solid clear blue, so it was no cloud that had shadowed him. He scanned the skies and kept his eyes from the sun, which beat pleasantly on his back. He'd almost given up when movement near the mountain caught his eye. He squinted to see what might have been something land and settle.

Distances were deceptive this high up. It could have been a bird, even a large one, but that didn't sit right. That ledge looked too far away, which mean whatever had landed was big.

A surge of adrenaline filled his veins at the thought of finding a Linrix. It meant both a fight, which sounded delightful after the monotony, and maybe enough time to get off the mountain before night.

He angled his climb toward the outcropping. It would take him at least another hour to get there, and before long, the adrenaline faded back into the monotony of the climb.

The outcropping turned out to be an uneven plateau that slopped down under an overhang. Anything beyond that was obscured by shadow. He secured his picks with a sense of relief and moved around the edge of the plateau toward the shadows. Even as he couldn't see in, whatever was in the shadows would easily be able to see him. He tried to move quickly without any sudden movements to draw the eye. If his luck held, whatever was in there would not be looking out.

He didn't even know if it was a Linrix. Were there other flying beasts that ruled the mountain? Probably. Were there other beasts that might kill him with little but a look? Probably. He knew none of these things because he wasn't even supposed to be here. Rose had given him no information on the mountains.

He tried not to dwell on how stupid this whole hunt really was.

It took his eyes precious moments to adjust in the shadows at the edge of the cave. It was cavernous, and the shadows gradated into the black until nothing further could be seen.

He removed his sword, careful not to make any sound, and scanned the area. He was crouched near the edge of the ledge and to the side of the cave mouth. The shelf was fairly clean and, more importantly, had some gouges in it that could have matched up with a Linrix. Also, they were not small gouges. If it was a Linrix, it was a big one.

It took him a good twenty minutes to make it through the cave entrance. Not only did he move slow and silent, but he frequently stopped to allow his eyes to adjust. Occasionally, he would catch a whiff of something strong, further confirming that something was here.

A glint of light caught his attention. He stared at it for a while until the shape of it resolved in his mind.

He stared at something staring at him. His heart skipped.

On instinct fed the sword to form an edge, and the eyes shifted, and then they rose. He stumbled back as they kept rising, further and further up until he was forced to look up at it at an uncomfortable angle.

A sound of the displaced wind was his only warning.

He slammed himself against the wall as a concussive sound shattered the silence. He could feel his chest compress before he was pelted with an explosion of rock. His head swam, and his ears rang from the compressive force.

The ground rumbled, then the cave followed. Dust drifted down from the ceiling as the sound grew.

He bolted for the exit in a desperate attempt to get out before the cave collapsed. The scrapped sound of claws followed him, so he threw himself against the wall again and stuck his sword out in a vain attempt to damage the thing as it went by.

It smashed against his arm painfully, but he managed a glancing blow against its front leg. It bellowed out a cry as it stumbled and regained its footing in turn. He had a moment to do more damage, but his mind was consumed with the realization that he had stuck his arm out at chest level and only managed to slice its leg.

Habit brought him back from dangerous thoughts to watch it limp its way out to the ledge. He expected it to turn around and fight, yet it kept going. He didn't quite realize what was happening until he saw it perch on the edge of the cliff.

"Oh no no no no no!"

He sprinted toward it even as it tipped slowly and then fell out of view.

An endless stream of cold, windy nights in search of yet another elusive Linrix assaulted his mind. So he did possibly the dumbest thing he'd ever done. He anchored to it.

He heard an indignant squawk from below as he was yanked forward and down into the dirt and stone. There were an excruciating few moments where the weight of the Linrix ground his body into the mountain until he was finally pulled over the ledge, spitting out the dirt he was just force-fed from a face that felt thoroughly flayed.

He flew, and not at all in a good way.

As soon as he'd cleared the edge, the release of an upward tether caused the linrix to plummet in an uncontrolled dive. This yanked Roland down hard enough that he lost grip of his sword. He _pulled_ it back to himself almost immediately, but the distraction had cost him. The linrix had straightened out its flight and left him diving down behind it. He had wanted to land on its back, but if he _pulled_ now, he would probably kill both of them from the impact alone.

So he dove behind it and used the anchor to pivot underneath and then forward. The Linrix snapped its wings out full-span in an attempt to keep itself in the air until he swung out in front of it. It flapped hard to rear back, but he was having none of that. He _pulled_ hard to bring them together and almost ripped both of them right out of the sky.

It was too much, and he backed off.

His head swam from the sudden shift in acceleration. The Linrix recovered quicker, but then it was larger and hadn't moved nearly as much as he. It regained its lift and tried to propel itself forward as he dropped.

He was much closer but had already dropped again to swing under the beast. He used the opportunity to reel in some of the slack, which in hindsight, would have been the smarter course of action from the beginning.

The next minutes were spent rocking back and forth under the beast while he systematically reeled in himself in an almost gentle manner. He had become somewhat concerned about his companion and its ability to maintain both of them in the air.

He was only a dozen paces trailing below the Linrix. Most of the pendulatory energy had been bled out to give both him and the beast a brief respite.

The problem was, they were still falling.

It was not so bad as an uncontrolled plummet, but the loss of elevation was noticeable. Birds, or stupid-large-flying creatures in this case, maintain a tenuous balance between lift, weight, speed, and sheer muscle power. Roland was heavy, but he doubted he was heavier than this thing's usual prey. This meant it used speed to help create lift, and here he was dragging through the air like an anchor.

They would need to become intimate if either of them were to survive the flight.

He really wanted on its back. Aside from the awesome factor of riding the beast, it should place him out of reach of its claws, which seemed absurdly important. He didn't bother figuring out which one was his primary motivating factor. It didn't matter anyway. He couldn't see a way to get up there without tearing them both out of the sky.

He _pulled_ himself closer, slowly so as not to disrupt its flight. If he were lucky, perhaps it wouldn't notice his approach.

It noticed just as he came in reach of its hind legs.

It kicked back with its hind legs and ripped his shoulder with such force that he spun around several times before he could stabilize himself.

He let himself back just out of its reach to evaluate his next approach.

He glanced at his shoulder and tested it. He was fertilizing the forest again, but the wound was mostly superficial, with only two deeper punctures. It hurt, but it wouldn't restrict his movement.

He _pulled_ again but chose to yank himself hard at the Linrix this time, trusting in its self-preservation to keep it in the air. Gods, but he hoped it could.

It let out an irritated growl while it flapped furiously to regain its lift. By the time it thought to kick, he'd already nuzzled up to its belly.

It immediately tried to scratch him off its belly, but he'd been prepared for that. As soon as it lifted its legs, he slashed them, paying careful attention to avoid cutting too deep. It wouldn't do to have it die mid-air from blood loss.

It screamed a deep sound that thundered in his chest and raised its legs to attack again, to which he responded swiftly. It tried only two more times before accepting its passenger as a permanent addition.

Convinced it would not attack again, he settled down on his knees and looked up at the ground below.

Yesterday he had touched an iced sky. Today the ground itself had turned into the sky, the beast below him his ground. This has turned into a bizarre hunt.

The flight turned peaceful as he watched the ground quickly pass above him. He spotted the ice forest behind him wrapped in a camouflage of snow that from above made it almost indistinguishable from the surrounding area as an illusion of an endless white field.

They continued for a time and passed over several valleys. Ever so slowly, he could feel its breath labor more as it struggled to keep its altitude. This continued until they came dangerously close to a ridge as the Linrix struggled to keep them above the tree line. It'd been so close Roland could have reached out and touched the treetops.

Only then did it occur to him to wonder why it hadn't landed yet. Every minute of flight drained it of the energy it would need to kill him.

A flash of alarm surged through him at the suspicion he'd missed something important. The linrix had stopped struggling hard and seemed content to keep itself only a few dozen paces above the trees.

It would land, and soon.

He looked closely at the ground above him as he tried to discern the destination. They were coming into the vale, and it seemed to have no intention of climbing back out.

After a few moments, he spotted a likely clearing at about the same time he linrix bellowed out a sound that made his blood run cold.

That was not the sound of pain or frustration, it was not a beast warning off another. That sound was a call.

It didn't take long for him to spot movement in the clearing. His ride had taken him to meet its mate.

He immediately plunged his sword into its ribcage, removed the sword just as quickly, released his anchor, and allowed himself to drop.

He was still a few dozen feet above treetops with densely interwoven branches. Interspersed within them were the Whitewoods, their blooded leaves contrasting against the snow underneath. He began to set anchors and _pull_ just enough to keep him away from the Whitewoods. He could mostly survive crashing through regular trees, maybe, but one didn't crash through a Whitewood. It would, instead, crash through him and leave him in far more pieces than he started out with.

He fed his sword as he plummeted into the dense canopy, severing them enough that he wouldn't be using his head to break the branches, or them to break his head. That didn't prevent them from tearing at him, and within moments the sword became useless as he spun and crashed through the branches.

He still had his anchors, and as soon as he was low enough, he _pulled_ hard to arrest his momentum. His head spun from so much deceleration at an odd angle, but within a few seconds, he'd almost stopped himself, still far above the forest floor.

The linrix crashed into him.

The impact stunned him for a second as the ground rapidly approached. The weight of the linrix pressed his back. If he didn't do something soon, he'd be crushed.

There was no way for him to slow both their momentum, so he tried to _pull_ himself out from under the thing. He only succeeded in wedging himself against its leg, but the effort was enough to rotate them both.

He briefly entertained the idea of _pulling_ himself back as they rotated with him on top, but by then, they'd reached the ground.

They hit the ground with a crash that filled his mind and emptied his lungs.

He heard bones crack as he bounced off the Linrix and then continue on to bounce off the forest floor twice before finally rolling to a stop. At some point, his coat had been torn off and gave him a good look at the bloody mess that was his body. He would have declared the whole mess a success and limped his way home, but he knew what he had seen.

Habit had him return his sword to his back. Something inside him sarcastically commented on just how much of bitch habit was.

He tried his best to ignore the pain, but he barely made it to his knees before the world swam. His condition was dire, his bones broken, his flesh rent, his mind consumed with pain, and his blood spilled freely onto the ground. Yet for all that, he still hesitated to do what was required. He wanted nothing more than to lay down to stare at the beautiful, endless sky, but he was out of time.

Deep breath, hold, don't think about it.

He forced his cycle into his wounds, all of them, and screamed.

His bones cracked and crackled in sharp moments of delirium with an underlying ache that consumed him, and he screamed.

His flesh knitted itself back together with pain far worse than the original trauma, and he screamed.

His nerves pushed themselves through both bone and flesh with a fire that seemed to sear his very soul, and he screamed.

When it was done, he gasped and struggled to control his breathing. Echoes of the pain bounced around in his head, but for his body, he was now whole, with only a deep fatigue that pressed down into his very bones. He forgot the sky altogether in want of nothing more than to close his eyes.

He was out of time, not that he ever had any.

He pushed himself up to see a linrix staring at him over the body of its dead mate. Its eyes were filled with a wild rage, and its wings folded over its head, aimed at him.
