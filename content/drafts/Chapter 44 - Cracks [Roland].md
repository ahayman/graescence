# 44 | Cracks [Roland]

Light streamed from narrow windows onto shelves filled with titles spanning cracked and creased spines. Light streamed through glass panes in the ceiling, a full three stories above, filtered down in ribbons that caught stray dust and scattered. And when Roland fed the panel nearest the door, light blossomed in lamps placed evenly between the towering cases.

It was very obviously a library. He'd guessed it before after peeking through the windows, but from outside it had always seemed dark and foreboding, reflecting more of himself than revealing what was inside. What he'd seen was enough to discern books on shelves and that was about it.

He would never have guessed the whole building was devoted to it or that there would be so much light. He'd thought maybe a room or two had books. But there were no rooms, just three stories with one extensive balcony, almost a floor itself, that allowed in the light from above to illumine desks and chairs arranged neatly in sections.

Sal would have loved it. Roland wasn't so sure. He'd never taken to school the way Sal had, and this room was absolutely filled with school.

"Come."

Rose walked by him and straight into a wide central isle without looking back. Roland shook off his stupor and followed her. He didn't bother to keep her pace, but trailed his finger over the spines as he walked. They felt of leather, paper, and occasionally something soft he couldn't identify. He didn't bother reading the title, but he caught the word "History" enough to realize what section this was. He felt antsy just thinking about it.

Rose had stopped at a long table in the first open area. On it were stacked half a dozen books, and beside those were blank paper and writing utensils. He slowed as he saw them, then stopped well short of the table.

He groaned to himself, suddenly wishing he were back in training. Pain and bruises and endless exhaustion he could deal with. This... not so much.

"Sit."

He looked at her, twisted his lips, walked past the seat she was pointing at, and sat as far from the stack of books as he could get. His leg began bouncing almost immediately.

Her eyes narrowed but she simply walked over and sat across from him.

"For a few hours each day you will learn—"

"What about training?" _Hours?_

"—_after_ which you will continue training with Master Yeng. Once you've learned the basics, we'll start a new training regimen."

"Learn what?" And why? His brow pinched. He already had a new master of arms.

"There's a variety of—"

"Wait, what new training?"

"—_of subjects_ you need to learn. You will have lacked any basic education, so I will help you master these rudiments."

"Right sure, but what new training?"

She took a deep breath, pressed her lips, and let it out through her nose. "You have developed... adequate physical discipline, but you must strengthen your mind. Once that is done, you will be ready — _barely ready_ — to begin training your gravics."

Roland's eyes widened as a grin grew on his lips. "Magic."

"Do not use that word," she scowled. "Magic is superstitious nonsense dreamt up by uneducated peasants. Gravics is a discipline, not some chant devised by idiots."

"Right..." magic. His grin never faltered.

"And _that_ is a long ways off." She pulled over the stack of books and tapped on them, jaw tense. "Once you can read and understand these books, only then will we begin your gravic training."

Roland perused the titles facing him with a look of disgust; they were not thin books. Two of them dealt with the history of the Empire, one of them was simple math he was he already knew, and the last, the only one with a soft cover, was on runes. That one, at least, would be interesting. Still, it wasn't actually too bad, all things considered.

"Promise?"

Her head twitched to the side. "When I have lied to you?"

He shrugged; it's not like he would know.

"Of course, you'll first need to learn how to read and write before you can tackle these." She tapped the books again.

Huh?

She pulled off a blank piece of paper and began to write on it. His face grew quizzical when he realized she was only writing a single, oversized letter.

"This is an—"

"A."

"Yes." She looked at him with suspicion, turned the page around, and handed him the charcoal. "Now draw it, just like I have. Don't try to be perfect; a rough approximation will be fine at first. It'll take time for your hand to—"

He drew an A.

She blinked slowly, then cocked her head.

He made more marks. "And this is a B." He tried to keep the sarcasm out of his tone, really he did.

Another mark. "C," he said.

Okay, maybe he wasn't trying _that_ hard.

And another two marks. "And here we have a D."

"Would you like to see an E?" Oh... huh yeah, that was sarcastic.

Her face flattened. "You already know how to read and write."

"Well, I'm not five, so yes... and doesn't everyone?"

She shook her head slowly. "Perhaps if you were born in a city of merchants."

His uncertainty mirrored her own. "No, everyone does. That's what the Empire is supposed to do."

She raised an eyebrow. "Do what?"

"Educate."

The shock on her face turned his gut. "_Everyone?_"

"Yes," he said firmly, "that's... that's part of what keeps everything together."

"Together..." she leaned back, "so the Empire educates everyone," she spoke slowly, as thought tasting the incredulity of the word, "so that... what, the peasants don't revolt?"

"Revolt?" His mouth tasted bitter. He'd actually gotten a rise out of her, but it wasn't going the way he though it would.

"And why would peasants want education anyway? What would they even do with it?" She shook her head. "I don't think there's ever been a single revolt because some idiots in a backwater village wanted to sit more in a classroom, or at all for that matter."

Roland's mouth had cracked open, blown away be her complete ignorance. Compounding this was bafflement on her face: it mirrored is own.

That and her frequent use of the word 'peasant' was getting under his skin.

He spoke slowly, not unconsciously mirroring her condescension. "Education enables the _citizens_ of the Empires to be more productive, which yields them more money, which keeps them happy."

"I hardly see how that benefits—"

"That _money_ can be taxed."

Never mind that this was taught— _should_ have been taught to any child over six, it was also just common sense. How could a woman who owned such countless books not know it? It was as though they had lived in two different worlds, and he had an uncomfortable dread in his belly that his was the anomaly.

"Next you'll tell me the Empire gives everyone free homes?"

He worked his mouth, unable to keep the shock from his face. Hers turned incredulous, almost mocking, and for the first time he could remember, he truly wanted to hurt her. All of the bruises, welts, and pain of her idea sick idea of training hadn't inspired such anger as did the scorn on her face now.

But then it was gone, and it was replaced with the calm exterior of a teacher, inviting him to forget her scorn. He did not.

"Perhaps we should discuss the Empire."

He suddenly couldn't think of anything less he would rather discuss. It's possible his face reflected this.

She waited a few seconds, then her voice turned firm. "Tell me about the Empire."

He spent some time watching her face. There was curiosity there, and beneath that he detected that scorn he hated, but also present was a rigid determination he'd come to know intimately. She would dig, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.

"It's the contract between the people." There, succinct and sufficient.

"The Empire is a... contract?" That mocking tone has crept into her tone again.

"No. Well, sort of. It's the uh... people's contract, I think?"

Rose leaned forward, brushed the books aside, rested her elbows on the desk, steepled her fingers, lightly rested her chin on them, and narrowed her eyes.

"So, tell me about this contract."

Roland huffed out his exasperation while he racked his brain. How do you explain something so simple as the direction down? It just was. He'd spent countless hours in school enduring endless details on the contract between the empire and the people, but it wasn't like he paid attention. That would be absurd.

"It's like I said: we work as part of the Empire, and they provide so that we can keep working, I guess... and everyone is happy."

Rose pressed her fingers into the bridge of her nose. "And this contract requires the Empire to give people homes?" she said from behind her hand.

"Yeah. Well, I mean, not like a full house."

"Okay...?" She waved him on with the hand not rubbing her head.

"Houses are given to those with a family, flats to those that don't."

She lifted her head, leaving her hand dangling with half pinched fingers. "So it's based on need, then?"

"Huh?"

"Need. To those who have greater need, go the greater goods?"

"I ah... yes?" Or no, not really.

"Your village must have had large families."

"It's not a _village_." He worked his mouth a moment before finally spitting out, "Why?"

"Well, if to have more children yields one goods," she spoke slowly, patronizing, "it stands to reason one would have as many children as possible."

His mouth dropped. Did she really believe 'peasants' thought like that? "It doesn't work like that."

"No? Please, then, enlighten me."

"You don't get more stuff for kids. That's just stupid. And why would you want to, anyway? Kids are work, like, a lot of work." Him more than most.

"And yet you claim they give out houses to families."

He shook his head. "You still have to pay it back."

"With money?"

"Errr... no." He frowned. "Time, I think." He was twelve; why did she think he would know this stuff?

"The same amount of time for everyone?"

"Yes? I don't know. Does it matter?"

"There's gotta be equity."

Roland stared at her and waited for something he could understand. She stared back, seeming to wait for a response. Finally, she huffed.

"Fair, Roland. It's has to be fair."

"How is getting a house not fair?"

"How is getting a free house fair? They cost materials and labor... who _pays_ for that? Why should anyone get it for free?"

"Because..." he blew out his frustration through his nose, trying to get it under control. She was challenging the very bedrock of his whole life and that, for some odd reason, was making him very angry. "a citizen who must worry about shelter isn't productive."

"It's all about being productive with you."

He jerked his head down, jaw bunched. After staring at the table for a few seconds, he spoke quietly.

"It's the same with food."

"_That_ is just a way for the Empire to control the provinces."

He jerked his eyes up. "But they do? Food is free?"

She waved it off. "Not all food, but the basics. No province would dare challenge the Empire when it means they would starve."

"But it's the _same thing_," he said, suddenly excited, "it frees the people to be pro—"

"No, Roland. Who do you think makes that food? Slaves. The Empire uses law to feed the slave industry. Slaves are then used to make the food that keeps the provinces in line. Neat little cycle." The bitterness of her tone was hard to miss.

"But the food helps the people be productive."

She wagged her head. "I suppose, but it's hardly the point."

"The people don't have to worry about food, and the Empire collects more tax money."

"If that's true, I doubt anyone knows it."

"But—"

"Roland, it's all about power; it's _always_ about power. Think. Food is produced by slaves that are taken 'lawfully', that same food given for free back to the provinces, and now to fight the Empire is to starve. Worse, it gives people a reason to support slavery— it benefits them and the slaves broke the law, so why not? Who cares if the laws are fair so long as it's not you. Moreover, it is the Royals who are given broad powers to enforce the law, which they use liberally to keep their positions secure, and so they send to the Empire the very slaves that keep them dependent."

"That doesn't mean it's not true," he said quietly, his eyes back down at the table. It didn't make sense that this was so important; he'd mostly ignored his teachers, and yet even suggesting they could be wrong brought on a startling sense of anger.

"Do you know who always end up as slaves?"

He blinked, suspecting a trap. "The people who break the law?" This was obvious.

"Do you know who always somehow ends up breaking the law?"

It was definitely a trap, except he had no idea how. "Errr... umm, the poor?" It was as safe an answer as he could come up with; she hated peasants after all.

"No Roland... well, yes, but that's not my point. It's you."

"What? I didn't break the law." At least, not that he knew of. Or, well, not if they didn't count all those times he ignored his parents. But that wasn't actually breaking the law, he was sure. Mostly sure. He'd never actually read the law. Was that a thing?

"It doesn't matter. You're just a barbie."

Roland stiffened, then rolled his eyes. It's not like she wasn't as white-skinned as he was. "That's just a slur."

"It is," she nodded, "but it is also a fundamental truth of our society."

"That makes no sense." Also, he was certain he'd just walked into her trap.

"Think about it. Why is that slur, out of all of them, such an important part of society."

"It's not." Was it? He'd barely heard it uttered. Why would they?

Simple, except for the look of utter bafflement from the woman who'd spend months training him.

"No," she said, an absolute statement. "Almost all of those taken as slaves are us, Roland, the barbies of the world."

Roland frowned, then shook his head. "I don't understand."

"No, I suppose you don't. Your village was isolated—"

"—it _wasn't_ a village—"

"—but I find it incredible you don't realize the systemic injustice of our society."

"_What_ are you talking about?"

"That we use to _rule_, Roland. We were the rightful rulers of society. That the very word 'Rotakan' was a barbie name. Our empire was named after us. It has and always will belong to _us_."

He stared at her, so vehement in her certainty, while he struggled to come to grips not with what she said, but why it mattered at all.

The empire just was. Who care who ruled, so long as they did a good job?

"It doesn't mean it's not true. Food given to the people makes them productive."

She stared at him for several moments, then sighed, deflated. "Perhaps it is true at that but, as I have said, it doesn't matter. The purpose is control. So no, the Empire does not give out homes; there would be no purpose. Education... that would be even worse; knowledge is its own kind of power, and that is not something you give to a peasant."

He did not point out that he was one of those peasants.

"Enough. We have more to cover. Next, we’ll discuss math. I take it that, by some miracle, you somehow know something of math?"

He nodded.

"One plus one?"

He stared at her. "Really?"

"Answer the question."

He sighed. "Two."

"Six minus four."

His head hit the table. He spoke at it, barely containing his exasperation. "Two."

"Six times four."

"Can't we just—"

"Six times four."

Another sigh. "Twenty four."

And on she went, slowly ramping up the difficulty through algebra, and ending it almost an hour later when she'd gotten into some principles on triangles he didn't know.

"Unbelievable," she said long after he'd given up hope.

He raised his head from a table wet from the humidity of his breath and stared at her.

"That peasants would be taught so much," she shook her head, not bothering to look at him but instead to the side, "it borders on obscene."

He rolled his eyes and dropped his head back to the table and behind arms wrapped a around in a futile attempt to protect him from her questions.

"What's even the point?" she continued, "It serves no purpose."

He peered at her over his arms. "You're teaching me."

Her eyes flashed. "You think _I_ would teach a peasant."

He screwed up his face, and though most of it was hidden, his tone carried his sarcasm perfectly well. "Pretty sure that's what I am."

She bristled, back stiffened, eyes constricted.

"Sit up," she snapped out, "you are _not_ a peasant."

Well, at least he'd gotten under her skin. He pushed himself up into a slump, noticed the humid table top, then smeared it across the table with his sleeve. He frowned at the table, then looked up at her.

"I came from a backwater mountain village, and you think I'm not a peasant?"

"Whatever you were you stopped being the moment you wiped that backwater village off the map."

The world stopped. He released a single breath. "What?"

She cocked her head. "You have enough power in you to rival the gods themselves, Roland. So no, you are most certainly _not_ a peasant, and I will not have you think like one."

"My... village?"

"I suppose I should be grateful you were taught; saves me a lot of trouble no matter what idiocy drove someone to do it."

"...was burned down by soldiers."

"This does mean you have a head start, though it seems you'll have much to unlearn as well."

"Not me... it... it was the soldiers, not me."

She cocked her head and blinked slowly at him. Suddenly, she threw her head back and laughed.

He flushed, though from embarrassment, horror, or rage he could not tell.

"There was no village, Roland. There were no soldiers, there was nothing when I got there, nothing but you."

"Because they burned it down!"

"There were no remains; there was no fire, no smoke; there were no trees."

"They... BURNED IT DOWN!"

A loud crash made Roland jump, and only then did he realize he was standing and had screamed the words. His knuckles ached under the strain of gripping the table.

"Not even a blade of grass survived," she whispered into the silence, "not for as far as the eye could see."

Finger by finger, he released his grip from the table. He turned, carefully picked up the chair, and righted it. He sat down, his expression blank. His soul suddenly felt devoid of anything at all.

Rose opened her mouth, but he spoke first with a quiet, fierce resolve.

"They burned it down," he snarled with such force the table cracked.

She blinked slowly and then stared at the crack. Her expression turned into that cool, composed, marble he'd beat himself against for so long.

"There's another branch of math dedicated to gravics," she said as though nothing happened, "though it is it's own field of study, practically its own language: the gravitica."

She pulled out a stack of paper, scratched a few symbols on a page, and flipped it around.

"This—"

"Runes."

Her eyes narrowed. "Sorry?"

"My dad uses these." Used. He used them. A flood of anguish surged through the void, but he pushed it down.

"Your father wrote symbols like this?"

His breath hitched, but otherwise, he showed no other emotion. He nodded and took a second more to keep his voice level. "He used them at work."

Her face had contorted in puzzlement. "And your father did what?"

"He was a logger." Short answers or his voice might break, and with it, him.

"A logger wrote symbols like this?" She tapped evenly on the paper.

"Well he um... he was more like... he told people what to do."

"A manager."

He nodded and kept his eyes lowered.

"And have you learned any of these runes?"

He nodded, but didn't look up. He didn't trust his voice, and her tone sounded dangerous.

"How many?"

"A hundred, maybe, but I don't know them all." Sal did, though; he'd already memorized them before Roland could recite the first twenty. Show off.

Gods, he missed Sal.

"What you call runes," she said slowly, "is the language of the gravitica. You should not know them."

"Why? Because we were _peasants_," he spat out.

"No, because it's illegal."

"It's... what?"

"Most _Royals_ don't know them. Only a select few, and only to perform very specific tasks for the Empire."

"That's not right." But his tone lacked conviction for, it seemed, everything he knew was wrong.

She spun the paper back to face her, scratched more symbols, and spun it back.

"Unlike all other writing, such as discrete math or just language, the gravitica is a relational language. The orientation and position of each character is essential." She tapped on a twisty character that Roland recognized as onsi. "For instance, if I placed the onsi symbol above the others, it would represent an entirely different form, even more so than if I had simply replaced it with the sampha."

She looked up and searched his eyes a moment, looking for recognition. He kept his face carefully blank, if only to see the frustration flash on her face. She snatched the paper and held it up.

"The characters can relate to each other in any number of dimensions, which makes a piece of paper an insufficient medium. It is, however, all we have and this," she waved the paper briefly, "is barely useful."

His eyes went wide as she let go of the paper and left it stuck firmly in the air while she scratched out more symbols on another. Well, that was one way to do it.

The second paper flew out and abutted the first at an angle.

"By adding a new dimension, we can describe much more powerful forms and interactions, but the shape is essential. This one, for example, is extremely basic and does little."

One of the sheets bent at an angle after which they reoriented themselves into a ‘k’ shape.

"This, however, is much more useful, though still quite basic. And all we had to do was change how the symbols relate to one another."

With a sudden clap, the papers assaulted the table and caused Roland to jump. He stared at them as though they might attack him next. Her eyes never left him as she continued her tirade.

"As entertaining as that parlor trick may be, it too is insufficient. Most useful gravic forms must be described in more dimensions than I've demonstrated, or even have available to us; some equations extend into as many dozen or even more. Furthermore, the relational distances involved are often ill-suited to paper, to say the least. So an indexing system was created to address the dimensional issue, and mostly just another set of symbols for distance, grouped into magnitudes. The indexing system is always tied to a central character, the origin, on the first page of an equation, and from that character we essentially ‘place’ each subsequent page in a specific dimension, at some angle, dimension, and distance from the origin. To that effect, you will see three sets of characters — or four if the author is manipulating the orientation of the plane — that position the page, and thus their characters, in relation to the central character. As you can imagine, this system would still waste an incredible amount of paper given the sheer amount of volume of space that must be described, and so the indexing system was condensed long ago into modifiers on the symbols themselves. This allows us to condense all the symbols into far fewer pages, but at the expense of readability; it can take decades to learn. It also exploded the potential number of symbols into practical infinity. It takes many years to learn how to read those symbols and mentally expand them into the multidimensional equations they describe. That, of course, will come later, much later. For now, we start with the primary characters in one or two... hmm."

Roland stared at her in a daze, mouth ajar. He tried to keep up at first but gave up when she threw out words like ‘dimensions’ and ‘indexing.’ It was all far beyond anything he'd ever learned and, he suspected, far beyond what anyone in his town knew.

She snatched out a blank page, drew on it, and flipped it around for him to see.

"What is this?"

"Sampha, you drew it earlier."

"No, I didn't; I only mentioned it."

She spun the paper, a few more scratches, then spun it back.

"And this?"

He stared at the strange symbol and shook his head.

Her frown deepened as she drew another character. "This?"

"Nafta."

More scratches. "This?'

"Onsi... that one you did draw before."

She grunted, then drew another. "This?"

"No, sorry."

She pinched her lips and drew another. Roland settled back as he realized it was going to be another long session of questions. Most of them he didn't know, but some he did, and as time went on, Rose grew increasingly agitated. She had taken to circling the ones he knew, creating sparse islands of knowledge amongst a sea of ignorance. That ignorance spanned several pages before she finally gave up and sat back.

"It makes no sense," she glared at the spread of pages on the table. "You don't know the gravitica, not really, just weirdly... specific... parts..."

She trailed off, staring at the pages. Her eyes darted to the circled runes over and over, her head twitching as it followed. After several minutes of this her eyes widened suddenly; she spoke.

"Logger." She looked up at Roland. "You father was a logger?"

"Yeah."

"Your whole village?"

"My _town_ exports wood, yeah."

"Oh... oh wow. And the Empire gives free homes to families?"

"Yeeaaassss?"

"And I bet those homes are much nicer than the flats."

Roland shrugged, now completely lost as to where this was going.

"How close was the nearest town?"

"What?"

"The nearest town, how close was it?"

"I don't know. A week or two, maybe? You know I'm only twelve, right? I never actually tried to run away."

"But people did, maybe older boys?"

"Sometimes, but no, not really."

"Sometimes?"

"Yeah, I mean, sometimes someone would try to see the world, but they usually came back."

"And they came back within a week?"

"Err..."

"And the ones who didn't come back?"

"Huh?"

She tapped the table. "The ones who made it to the other town, did any of _them_ come back, ever?"

"I ah... no?"

She smiled, but something about it felt predatory; it raised the hair on his neck. "And you never got visitors?"

"Well, a Royal would come every few years."

Her brow lifted. "A Royal? Oh yes, of course," she said mostly to herself, "they would have to."

"What?"

"One last question: Have you ever heard the term Elderin before?"

He shook his head, feeling very much lost and confused.

"Unbelievable."

"_What_ are you talking about?"

She stared at him and the wonder on her face evaporated into consideration. After a moment, that too vanished. "That’s enough questions for now."

"What! No but—"

"We'll start with these books." She slid a stack of them toward him.

"What about my town?"

"A lot you may already know but you still have catching up to do."

Roland opened his mouth but shut it when the look on her face turned dangerous.

His jaw clenched, he pulled the stack of books toward him, then noticed she'd included one on runes. He pulled it out from the middle.

She smiled. "Those will make more sense once you learn to use your power since many of the symbols are intricately linked to what you can do. For now, I want you to read the first chapter and answer all the questions at the end." She slid a small stack of paper over to him. "Use this paper to answer on."

He opened the front cover and his heart fell. Whoever wrote it seemed intent, maybe even obsessed, with putting as many words as possible on a single page. He turned to the first page to see the same dense writing covered most of it. Interspersed between the words was an occasional rune, and many of the words held no meaning to him. He looked up at Rose.

"When you encounter a word you don’t know, ask me," she said as she opened and began reading what looked to be a novel.

Roland looked back down at the text with a skeptical expression. There was a lot of asking on just this page alone.

"Go on," she said without looking up, "you have a lot to learn."

He stared at her for several minutes, watching her eyes dart through the words in her novel. Her face was a careful neutral; she knew he watched her. He didn't care. She knew something about his town; she had answers. He wanted— no, he _needed_ those answers, no matter how long it took.

But Rose was stubborn like marble. He couldn't pester her, or annoy her, or frustrate her into spilling. She would run circles around his arguments and always turn them back on him. No, she would continue on, inexorable in her pace and expectations, him her sole purpose for who knows how long.

But marble always had cracks. He just needed to find them. And he _would_ find them; he had the time.

He turned his attention to the page, read about ten words, and then asked Rose the first of what would be an endless stream of questions, always looking for the cracks.
