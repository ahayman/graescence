# 88 | Safe

Roland chewed his cheek as he sat nervously by the fire, his eyes glued to the slow but rhythmic breathing of the girl beside him. He’d dragged out his bedding after they’d cleaned and bound her wounds and carefully wrapped her up by the fire.

The cook, it turned out, had medical training, and he had plenty of supplies, so, for the most part, Anna was expected to recover quickly. He’d helped, of course, his own not-insignificant knowledge of first-aid impressing several, but that was a distant thought as he sat beside her.

He wouldn’t move until she did.

Seeing her lying there hurt and unconscious stabbed at him. His mind spun endlessly as it replayed the night over and over again.

This was his fault.

If he’d been quicker, more aware of the sabre’s deception, he could have headed it off before it reached Anna. She wouldn’t be lying here with such horrible wounds. He should have protected her, kept her from harm.

Would she even want him after such horrible failure? He feared not, his heart confident he’d damaged their relationship beyond repair. Just the idea drove a dagger through his heart, yet how could it be otherwise? He was the monster. By what absurd hubris did he assume he could be with such a beautiful creature?

“Dammit Stan, this thing is _heavy_.”

Roland turned to see the trio enter the camp. Fin was sweating as he carried the absurdly large head of the sabre with both hands.

“I’m practically lifting the whole thing as it is, Fin.” Stan’s voice was flat, betrayed only by a hit of amusement.

“Bull sh... ugh... gods man, what the hell?” Fin stumbled, clearly trying to keep the head from falling out of his hands. He gave Stan a nasty glare.

“And that’s how much it _actually_ weighs.”

“Ugh, _you_ take it.” Fin shoved it at Jonah, who readily took it in hand.

Jonah took it up easily and looked curiously at it a moment. He then tucked it awkwardly under his arm as Fin’s eyes went wide. Stan stood behind Fin and had pursed his lips in amusement, but his eyes betrayed a level of concentration.

“Huh... not too bad,” Jonah said cheerfully as he gave Fin a considering look.

Fin sputtered something that might have been foul had anyone understood him. He stalked over to Roland and sat down with a scowl. Both Stan and Jonah watched him with no small amount of amusement. Roland turned back when Jonah split off toward Alister while Stan walked over to the food tent. Jonah grunted as they split apart, though Fin hadn’t seen it.

Fin took a few minutes to calm down. “How’s she doing?” he asked quietly.

“Okay, I think. She lost some blood, but her wounds are clean and bound. She just needs rest.”

Fin nodded, and he turned unfocused eyes toward the fire. For the first time, Roland realized it was getting lighter. It was a pre-dawn light, pregnant with the expectations of a new day. He wondered just how long he’d sat there before he realized he didn’t care. He’d sit a thousand more mornings just to see her safe.

“So... inherent trait?”

Roland absently shifted his head toward Fin and stared. It took him a moment to register the words. He nodded and moved to speak, but Stan arrived with several bowls in his arms, which he passed out to Roland and Fin, setting one by the fire and another in his lap.

Fin looked at the bowl suspiciously. Likely it contained some herb or vegetable good for him, which was anathema to him, but he ate anyway. Hunger had no regard for the sacred.

Intense emotions, and guilt especially, can hide a multitude of needs. He didn’t realize just how hungry he was until that first bite, which ignited a deep hunger that drove him to quickly devour the bowl. He was scraping the bottom before the conversation started up again.

“So, just how long have you been able to fly?” Stan asked in a carefully crafted conversational tone.

“Damn good question.”

Both Fin and Stan stared at him expectantly. He shrugged and absently rubbed the back of his neck as he considered his reply.

“It’s just something I learned to do.”

“Oh no, boy, you’re not getting off that easy.” Fin’s tone was playful but insistent.

Stan nodded. “Pulling is a fairly common inherent trait, pushing a bit less so but not exactly rare. Those who have it invariably make excellent shielders. But I can’t recall hearing of _anyone_ capable of using that trait for locomotion, something you seem to do naturally.”

Roland snorted. “No, that... that took me a lot of years to learn.”

“Years... here?”

Roland blanched, but there was no point denying it. He gave a small nod.

“How long, how many years?” a small, earnest voice asked from below.

Roland looked down in surprise to see Anna awake. She hadn’t moved, but her eyes were open and had tracked their conversation. She looked pale and weak but far better than she’d been only hours ago.

A new wave of guilt tore at him.

He shrugged and tried to look away, but the ensuing silence was far too loud. His mind cast around for some way to distract the conversation, anything that might stop them from asking these questions. Nothing would come.

“How many years, Roland?” Her voice was stronger now, more insistent. He couldn’t avoid this, yet the urge to shrink and hide almost overcame him. His mind briefly flirted with the idea of running away, but even the thought of that stabbed him, and he quickly dismissed it.

“I don’t know.”

Anna shook her head, though it looked languid and painful. “Not good enough.”

“It’s... the years have... I _don’t_  know. Years but I can’t...”

Roland’s jaw clenched at the frustration, years of frustration, built up at not knowing. He’d tried countless times to tease apart the blur of his past, but he couldn’t. He honestly didn’t know how long he’d been here.

“How about an estimated guess?” Stan, always the pragmatist.

He looked hard at them, one part of him begging them to drop the question, the other part yearning to tell them everything. Yet either unaware or calloused uncaring, they simply stared back in return.

“Ten, twelve, eight, eighteen... _I don’t know_. I can’t...” He took a deep breath. “The memories, they don’t separate like that.”

Fin let out a long whistle, and Stan blanched. But it was Anna that broke Roland’s heart. She just stared at him with a look of... horror, like he wasn’t real, as though he couldn’t possibly exist. She looked confused and hurt in a way he couldn’t understand.

“How old were you?” she asked quietly.

Roland’s head dipped, and he felt shame he didn’t understand, shame he knew he should have buried long ago. He didn’t understand why he would feel this way, yet his body began to tremble slightly, and he found it hard to breathe. It was too much. He needed to run, to fight, to hunt, _anything_ other than this.

She looked at him, and her eyes pierced him, holding him in place until his whole world felt on the verge of collapse. This... this answer he knew. He knew this answer at the core of his soul.

“Nine,” he whispered. Some part of him, some innocent yet insistent part him shouted that no, he’d been almost ten. Almost.

“No, but that’s not right,” Fin said, shaking his head. Stan watched him with an expressionless face.

“She brought you _here_ when you were ten?” Anna insisted. She hadn’t looked away, not even to blink. She’d pinned him in place with those beautiful, cruel eyes.

He nodded. His breath came quick and shallow.

She moved to get up and gasped as the wounds on her back stretched, yet she waved off help while keeping her eyes glued to Roland. She rose to her knees and gently reached up to take his head in her hands. She pulled until their foreheads touched, each gently resting on the other, and still, her eyes never left his.

“I am so sorry,” she whispered.

He broke. After so many years of fighting and failing, the bearing of innumerable wounds and incalculable humiliation, the obsidian walls he’d built around his heart were thick, beastly things designed to protect and contain. Yet she broke them all down with only four words of tenderness.

His body twitched, and he sought to pull away from her, yet her hands held him there, crown to crown, in an intimate embrace he could not run from.

His body trembled as he fought desperately to keep the flood contained. He watched in horror as tears fled his eyes, rolling down his face, only to foul the earth with his shame. She pulled him down onto his knees, forcing his head into her neck as he began to weep.

“You’re safe now,” she whispered through his sobs, repeating over and over again, “You’re okay.”

Grief assaulted him in waves, overriding his every attempt at control while his fingers dug into her back. His stomach convulsed under the onslaught, as a tide of everything he’d pushed down over the years came flooding back. It was not one thing that drove the tide, but many, both small and large, blending together, each its own drop in a sea of pain.

And through all of this shot fear, it’s color scarlet against the black tide. Rose would know. She would know he’d let his walls down. She would know he’d allowed his emotions out, she’d know his control had lapsed. She would know, and she would punish him, beat him until he brought himself back under control.

He screamed at the tide, pleading with it to stop, threatening it with Rose’s wrath. Yet where fear had once given him the strength to suppress, in Anna’s arms, it only served to fuel a tide that threatened to drown him.

And then it would release, pulling back enough that his body would slump, supported only by Anna’s arms. In those moments, he felt bone-deep exhaustion that left him listless and empty. His eyes would stare vacantly at the dance of fire before him as he waited for the next wave.

This continued until the sun had traveled far into the sky, and the fire had burnt itself out. They sat alone on the bench with Stan and Fin no longer in sight. Anna had moved to sit beside him, holding his hand as they both watched the smoke drift aimlessly from the ash.

She’d eaten the fourth bowl at some point, though he couldn’t recall her doing so. In truth, he couldn’t remember much of the last few hours, blurred as it was already in his memory. Just like his life, blurred and indistinct, years merged as one.

“I’m sorry.” His voice was both strained and tired.

She shook her head. “For what? Being kidnapped?”

“No, I... I failed to find you in time. I let the sabre wound you...”

“No!” Her voice had hardened, and he drew back in surprise. “You don’t get to take responsibility for _my_ actions. They’re mine, mine alone. I chose to go out there alone. I knew the risks and I _chose_ to do it... these wounds are mine. You don’t get to take that away from me.”

She stared at him, her eyes angry and hard until he nodded. She softened immediately, smiled, then pulled him close to kiss him on his forehead. For a moment, he wondered just what he’d gotten himself into, but the thought evaporated under her kiss. Even her temper was a fresh relief against the emotionless stoicism of Rose.

“Sorry,” she said in a conciliary tone. “I’ve had people trying to shape my decisions since I was born. It’s a sensitive subject for me.”

He squeezed her hand, “It’s okay. I’m used to... to being...” he trailed off, the words escaping him.

“At fault?”

He frowned and thought for a moment, but “Yes. All these years, I’ve never been good enough. I’ve failed every task she’s ever assigned me.”

“And yet you defeat beasts that would tear apart any normal man.”

Only because I’m the monster.

He shook his head, “It’s not enough. It’s never enough...”

She shifted and turned, taking both his hands, “Enough for what? What more could you possibly need to accomplish?”

She didn’t understand. She didn’t know what that lurked beneath the tides, what he fought so hard to contain. She couldn’t comprehend just what power it held and how it could destroy everything.

No, Rose was right. His... outburst had proven it. He wasn’t ready, wasn’t in control. Anna simply didn’t understand. He _deserved_ those scars, no matter how his body healed. He needed them. He needed Rose to help him contain the terrible power inside him. Without her... without her, all was lost.

But which her?

He was standing, and his breath came quick and shallow. Anna had stood with him, hands firmly clasping his, which had grown hot and sweaty.

“It’s _okay_,” she said, her voice even and reassuring. “You’re safe now. You don’t need to stay here anymore.”

He pulled back and shook his head in denial, but she continued over the objection forming on his mouth.

“We’ll find your family, and you can be with them, and we’ll... what?”

“They’re dead,” he breathed, “they... the whole town...”

She let out a long breath, her brow furrowed as her head shook. “I’m sorry... I didn’t know.” A moment later, she stole herself, and her eyes became determined, “But you can still leave, leave with us.”

“No, no, I can’t. She won’t allow it.”

“*She* doesn’t have to,” she almost snarled, then softened just as quickly, “Just come with us.”

Her pleading tore at him. She couldn’t understand, but he wanted so desperately to go, to be with her. Just the idea sounded like a dream, and it was an impossible one.

“You don’t understand. She would never just _let_ me leave... and she’s... she’s more than you know.”

“I know she seems that way, Roland, but she’s just a person.”

He barked out a laugh, “She’s more than a person, she’s an _elder_, Anna. Even I don’t know what she’s capable of. But my _accomplishments_,” he spat out sarcastically, “pale to what she can do.”

Anna’s hands flew to her mouth. It took Roland a moment to realize she was giggling. “Roland,” she said after a moment, “elders are a myth...”

“No, they’re not.” But it was hard to sound convincing with her eyes so clearly amused. He reached back and yanked his sword before holding it between them. “This is the _least_ of her relics, barely a training tool compared to the weapons she owns. What you call a relic is nothing to her, nothing! And she’s far more capable than anyone could be in a single lifetime. And I’ve caught her speaking of the _last_ Empire in the first person.”

Anna froze, and he saw doubt flicker across her eyes. “There is only one Empire,” she said flatly with narrowed eyes, but it was painfully clear she didn’t believe it.

He frowned at her. “You don’t believe that.”

Her lips pursed before she began chewing on her bottom lip. “That’s... not known, and not safe to speak about, not really.” She conceded with a shook her head, but her refusal still rang in the air. “No, that just means she’s abnormally well informed, which makes sense in a way. But she’s _not_ immortal, Roland. That’s... it’s just insane to think so.”

It was clear she would not budge on this, and Roland felt a sense of doubt worm his way into him. Rose was an _elder_, he was sure of it. She _had_ to be, if only to make some kind of sense of his life. If Rose were just a regular person, then what was he?

Yet what if he _could_ just... leave. Just like that. Just walk out of the forest, hand in hand with Anna and live life.

The thought spun a yearning that cored into the deepest parts of his soul. He’d once longed to be a hero, his boyish self dreaming of adventure, yet now he’d trade everything just to be by her side in a life that quietly faded away into the background.

He shook his head and tried to clear the confusing contradictions that spun there. She took his free hand in both of hers and looked him in the eyes. He melted under her gaze.

“Hey, I’m sorry. It’s just... you’re the first person to ever feel real to me, and I don’t want to lose you to this _place_. I won’t leave here without you. I know this is hard for you, but I promise we can leave together. We _have_ to or... or neither of us will.”

It was too much. He wanted to leave with her more than anything in the world. And so he nodded his ascent, even as a knot of unease settled in the pit of his stomach. It was a lie, and he knew it. Oh, he would try, but he didn’t honestly believe he could.

Anna’s return smile melted his heart even as a serpent of guilt slowly wrapped itself around and squeezed joy. She squeezed his hand and pulled him in for a kiss that chased away his demons. He lingered there as long as he could.

“Come on!” she said excitedly and pulled his hand.

She might have been bouncing for all that her leg would allow her. She guided him to the food tent. Roland noticed an unusual level of activity around the camp as people went about busily tearing things down. Even the food tent was halfway deconstructed when they arrived, although his curiosity was soon overridden by hunger.

Most of the cooking utensils were already packed away, but there was still food laid out for lunch. They grabbed what was left of the hard cheese, dried meats, and nuts before filling their water.

“What’s going on?” Roland asked as they walked back to the bench.

“Packing day!” she said excitedly as she took a bite of cheese. Seeing his look, she explained, “With the sabre dead, it should be safe — or well _safer_ — to move camp. Tomorrow we’ll move in deeper toward the larger Whitewoods.”

“Deeper?” Roland was surprised that they’d want to risk it.

She shrugged, “Nobody wants to go back without a reward... that would be giving up.” She paused a moment, her face turning serious, “And I think a lot of people _can’t_ go back without a full share. Not unless they want to end up on Ionia.”

He recalled that Stan needed to pay off a slave bounty. He also recalled his warning to Jonah that going deeper into the forest would not serve them well.

As they approached the bench, he paused as he saw Alister walking toward them. He tore off a piece of meat, chewing on it as he waited for the man to approach.

“I hear we have you to thank for killing that... thing,” Alister said amicably.

“Anna too,” Roland said as he chewed.

He gave Anna an appreciating nod but turned back to Roland, “And yet without you, it would still be hunting us.”

Roland shrugged lightly, not sure how to respond.

“Well, I talked with several members of the camp, and they’ve agreed to give up a small portion of their share, enough that you’ll have a full share once we get out of here.”

Roland stopped chewing and stared at Alister, stunned. These people risked everything for their share. To give up even a small part of it was almost unthinkable. He looked over at Anna, who just beamed back at him a huge smile.

“You deserve it,” she said.

Alister nodded. “You most certainly do. For the first time in months, our people have hope again. They believe that we just might make it out of here alive.”

“Thank you,” Roland breathed.

He had a share now, something he could use to actually build a life with Anna. Just maybe they would make it out of this forest, and they could find a place to live where Rose would never find him.

He clung to that hope as a drowning man would a raft, swaying with invisible tides while hoping the horizon’s storm would pass him by. The idea of freedom and normalcy was intoxicating. Where would they live? Far from here for certain. Maybe Caldonia or one of its islands? As a boy, he’d often dreamed of sailing the islands and pirate adventures. And while those adventures didn’t appeal to him anymore, surely they could hide in one of them. There were so many—

“Roland,” Anna asked quietly to draw him out of visions of white beaches. “How are you... unhurt?”

He looked at her strangely, not understanding the question until he noticed her glancing down at his side. He looked down and immediately regretted not changing his shirt, or at least throwing his coat over it. His shirt was still torn with gashes, but the bloodstains were evident in the light. They’d spent so much time in front of the fire, he hadn’t noticed the draft.

He began to gauge what he should tell her when that serpent of guilt began to squeeze. No, he wouldn’t lie. He couldn’t, not to her. Not anymore.

“A girl named Ellie taught me.”

Her eyes narrowed dangerously. “And just who is Ellie?”

He faltered. “Just ah... well, she lives here too.”

“A _girl_, who’s name is Ellie, just happens to also live here in the forest?”

“Well, yes.”

“And you don’t think it might be getting a little crowded, what with all these women living around you?”

He frowned in confusion before he realized the problem. Then, suddenly, he began to laugh. He didn’t mean to, not really, but after everything, just the idea that Anna might be jealous of Ellie — possibly the most annoying girl in the world — was beyond comedic. It took him a minute to stop laughing, but when he looked over, Anna had daggers in her eyes. For some reason, that only made him laugh harder.

“Perhaps you’d like to enlighten me as to the nature of your amusement,” she said flatly after a few more minutes of watching him laugh.

He took some time to collect himself before replying. “It’s just that Ellie is... well, Ellie. I ah... I guess it would be like dating your sister. Your very annoying and unnaturally weird little sister. It’s just ridiculous to even think about.”

“Uh huh,” she said suspiciously, but her eyes softened all the same.

“And exactly how does _Ellie_ keep you unhurt from the claws of demons?”

“She ah... well, I guess she knows things.”

“So she knows things, huh?”

“Uh-huh, yeah, like how to cycle.”

“Cycle... Roland, are you just making up words?”

Roland stopped and looked at her curiously. She didn’t know what a cycle was.

He wasn’t sure why he was surprised, but he was. Ellie had made it sound so natural, normal even, that he’d just figured others would know what he was talking about. That Anna didn’t know felt significant, though he couldn’t figure out exactly why. Ellie was weird and annoying, but he’d come to trust her on some level. She didn’t lie, not to him, at least. So why did she think it was normal?

“Oh, hey Roland,” Stan said, interrupting their conversation. “You mind helping us break down the main tent? It should be good practice for you.”

Roland practically jumped up at the opportunity to avoid the uncomfortable conversation. He cast a regretful look at Anna, who simply narrowed her eyes but eventually shook her head and waved him off dismissively.

“Looked like you needed rescuing,” Stan chuckled as they walked away.

He nodded back enthusiastically but then had a thought. “Stan, have you ever heard of a cycle before?”

“A cycle? Hmmm... no. I mean, I know what the word means, but it holds no significance to me. Why?”

“Nothing, just something I heard once.”

Roland furrowed his brow in thought. If anyone would know, he figured Stan would. So what did it mean? Cycling had been possibly the most significant technique he’d ever learned, and Ellie had almost given to him as an afterthought.

He might have dwelled on this more, but Stan immediately set him to work once they arrived at the tent. He insisted Roland use surfaces whenever possible. It was a common theme Stan used to help him increase his skill using everyday tasks.

Once they were done with the main tent, they moved on to others. The sleeping tents were left up, of course, but almost everything else was packed up and placed on sleds.

By night, most of the camp had been packed up, and Roland collapsed into bed, careful not to disturb Anna, who had fallen asleep much earlier in the evening. He’d barely laid down before sleep consumed him.
