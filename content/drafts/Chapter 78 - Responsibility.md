# 78 | Responsibility

“I have to say, that was possibly the most impressive thing I’ve seen you do. I mean, you actually managed to _ride_ a Linrix down the mountain and then kill the parents of a poor defenseless baby.”

Roland stood, whole and wholly confused. He was feeding energy into his sword, but he didn’t even recall taking it off his back. The last thing he could remember was _pulling_ toward the Linrix and then... nothing.

He knelt down and studied the animal.

Its head had been decapitated cleanly, but the angle made no sense. He’d need to stand either directly adjacent to it or perhaps on its back, and even then, it almost looked as though it had been kneeling. He couldn’t figure out how he got from his last memory to what he observed before him.

Fingers suddenly appeared in his vision and snapped several times.

“Are you even listening to me?”

“What?”

“You don’t hear it?”

Roland released a tired, frustrated sigh. Ellie was nothing if not persistent. “What are you talking about?”

“Listen carefully, and you can hear the sound of tragedy.”

He shook his head and returned his attention back to the scene. His dagger was still wedged in its eye, at least confirming what memory he had was valid. He reached to remove it but stopped and slowly looked over at his arm. He vividly recalled losing a portion of the flesh on his arm, yet here it was uninjured. He’d healed himself, again, and yet with no memory. That more than anything shook him. He should remember pain like that.

Ellie was getting louder and more insistent. He looked over at her, but his eyes grew distant. Nothing about this made sense.

He was tired, exhausted, and unaccountably hungry. He closed his eyes, slowed his breathing, and recentered himself. His ears were still ringing, but Ellie continued to insist he listen, and so he did. Trust and all that. She might annoying, but she’d never push like this unless it was important.

Ah, but there, a sound.

He opened his eyes, ignored the look Ellie gave him, and tracked the source of the sound. He was sure it was an animal, but he couldn’t identify what exactly it was. It sounded small, like a crying cat, maybe? He tracked the sound to the opposite side of the clearing in a darkened area.

He approached and saw an entrance to a cave that seemed to descend underground. It was too dark for him to see inside, so he formed an edge on the sword and waited for his eyes to adjust. While it didn’t sound dangerous, that didn’t mean much in this forest.

He approached the entrance slowly then fell back startled as a small pair of eyes jumped out of the cave entrance. He was even more surprised when he saw that it was what looked like a baby linrix, no bigger than a large cat. It growled at him first, then sniffed the air and looked confused.

Then it lunged at him.

Roland took a startled step back and fell on his backside but was otherwise too exhausted to fend off the creature. It jumped on his arm and scampered around his neck and settled down, its tail firmly wrapped around his arm for support.

Roland sat there frozen, unsure of what to do as the baby closed its eyes and purred in his ear. He winced slightly as it dug its claws into his shoulder.

“Now isn’t that something. You must smell like its parents.”

Roland gave Ellie an exasperated and pleading look. She smiled at him and looked far too satisfied, which made him even more nervous.

“Looks like you have yourself a baby linrix, treewalker... or should I call you linrix-rider now?”

“What? No! No... nope.” He tried to pull it off him but winced as it dug in. The effort caused his head to swim.

“What are you going to call it?”

“I am not calling it anything.”

“You’ve gotta call it something. You can’t just walk around calling it baby linrix.”

“What makes you think I’m keeping it?” He tried to pry off its paws, one by one, but it merely replaced each one as he moved to the next.

“Oh, I don’t think you have a choice.”

“What do you mean?”

“They bond for life, usually right after leaving their parents, which you did a fantastic job of removing from the picture. As far as it’s concerned, you are its bond... uh partner? Can’t really call you its mate now, can I?”

He stopped messing with the Linrix and glared at her.

“You _killed_ its parents, treewalker. It’s your responsibility now.”

Roland looked over askance at the animal. Just what the hell was he supposed to do with it now? He tried to consider killing it, but something in him rebelled against the idea. He just couldn’t slaughter an innocent baby, no matter what it might become... but of course he could murder its parents. Guilt wormed its way through his stomach.

He moved to walk away and then sat up.

He was on the ground, but he couldn’t recall getting there. His head was dizzy and light. The Linrix had fallen off his shoulder and had to roll back to its feet, looking somewhat disgruntled. It stretched its legs and wings before calmly walking back to Roland. He jumped back to his feet and took several steps back and wavered, light-headed. The Linrix jumped at him.

He was on the ground again, the linrix happily curled up on his chest. Wow, but this had to stop.

He sat up again, and the world wobbled as the linrix slid into his lap. He blinked slowly, but his head swam, and exhaustion assaulted him in waves. At this rate, he didn’t think he’d make it to his feet. He pushed himself up.

He was lying on the ground and staring into a darkness that bled away slowly to reveal Ellie’s face smirking at him. The baby Linrix had its front two feet on his chest and was mewling.

“Yes, yes, little one. He’s going to pass out... again. Let’s get him fixed up, and then I’m sure he’ll give you proper a name.”

----

His eyes snapped open in time to see a tongue attack him.

“Wha... agh.”

The vicious tongue licked the inside of his mouth. He sputtered and spit as he sat up and pushed the offensive beast off him. It gave an indignant sound as it rolled back over onto its feet. They glared at one another for a moment.

“Oh good, you’re up. So, when was the last time you ate?”

He groaned as the question brought his attention to a crazed and empty stomach. He looked down at himself and was shocked by his emaciated form. He looked as though he hadn’t eaten for weeks. No wonder he’d been so light-headed.

He quickly dug through his bag and began tearing through his rations.

“How long was I out?” He managed to spit out the words between bites.

“That’s disgusting, and you slept the night. It’s probably mid-morning now.”

“You sure about that?” He wouldn’t be surprised if he’d actually been here a week.

“Sure, uh yeah... yes, I am.”  She nodded enthusiastically.

He grunted a non-commital noise and reapplied his attention to the food. She wouldn’t know a day from a week, so he didn’t press the issue. His stomach insisted he was barely alive, but alive he was, and hunger dominated his thoughts. He finished several days rations in only a few minutes and then scooted himself back to rest against the wall.

“Where are we?” The cave looked vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t place it.

“Same place you found miss attitude over there.” She waved over at the Linrix, who’d curled up in a corner. “This is... or well, it was its home, and I didn’t want to drag you through the forest again.”

He snorted. “That only happened once.”

“And, you’re heavy.”

“Not anymore,” he grumbled under his breath. How had he lost so much weight?

The cave was smaller than he’d thought it’d be, and it smelled... lived in. It wouldn’t have fit both parents, but then he supposed it didn’t have to with one of them sleeping on the mountain. Had he really ridden the thing off the mountain? It seemed like ages ago.

Also, he smelled almost as bad as the cave did.

“You’re gonna have to name it, you know.”

“Hmmm.... no.”

He got up and picked through his pack to find a shirt. Maybe that would help the smell, at least until he got home into a decent bath. Besides, his original shirt was shredded, but that wasn’t exactly uncommon for him, and he normally brought along an extra.

“You can’t just not name it.”

He stopped his rummaging and looked up at her. “Yes, actually, I can.” He frowned and continued to search for the elusive shirt until her foot kicked away his pack.

“What are—”

“You will _not_ leave it behind.”

He blinked. That was exactly what he’d intended to do.

“You _killed_ its parents. It’s your responsibility now.”

“Nope.”

He made for his pack, but she quickly moved to block him.

“Name it.”

“Move, please.”

“Name _it_.”

“I’m not going to—”

“Name. it.”

He pinched his lips and glared at her, but she lifted her chin and adopted a stone-faced, imperial look. The message was clear. He would either name it or lose his pack, and he had no doubt she’d follow through.

“Agh... fine, what do you suggest?”

She shrugged lightly and smiled. “She’s your linrix.”

“Oh, come on!”

“How hard could it be to name something? Just name her.”

“Her?”

“...you didn’t check?”

“What? No, of course not.”

“Huh, kind of seems like the first thing I’d want to know, especially if I had to name it.”

Roland growled under his breath and stared spitefully at the curled up ball of fur in the corner of the room until his heart softened just a little. It certainly wasn’t its fault he was in this predicament, but that still changed nothing. How was he supposed to bring it back to Rose? She sure as hell wouldn’t allow him a pet.

He ground his teeth and narrowed his eyes. But could she prevent him from keeping it? Suddenly, it seemed to him very important that he win that particular battle. She may not like him having a pet, but what could she do, kill it? How would that be different than leaving it here to starve?

“It cannot be that difficult to find a name.”

“I’m thinking.”

“Clearly.”

He threw up his hands. “You’re not helping.”

“I’m not the one who callously slaughtered its parents, now am I?”

He closed his eyes, unclenched his hands, and took a deep breath. He held it until it burned, and he felt a little light-headed, then finally released.

“You’re not defining her by some meaningless sounds you make up. She’ll teach you what her name means. You just need something to call her so you can discover her as she naturally is.”

He gave her a started look, his mouth ajar. He couldn’t understand how she could move from pointless to pithy in just a few seconds.

“Ok, fine.”

Why was this so hard? He just needed to think of something related to a linrix, right? He stared at it while it slept. They were beautiful creatures, magnificent, and he flew one down the mountain. It seemed impossible, and at the time, it was all panic and desperation, yet the memory felt beautiful. He’d sat on its belly and watched the world fly by, almost as though he rode the sky itself.

“Oh will you just say something.”

The sky. “Skyra.”

The baby linrix lifted her head and looked at him curiously before walking over and curling up next to him.

“First try, huh? I think she likes the name. Looks like you have yourself a pet.”

Anger flared, and he gave her a furious look. She returned a smug smile, to which he growled and stomped out of the cave. On his way, he grabbed his sword. Maybe he could find something else to kill.
