# 24 | Wayward [Anna]

Princess Longsun walked down a white paneled hall, silent except for the rustle of cloth. The hallway curved slightly around a series of large state rooms as it wrapped around the spire’s edge. It was pristine, with inset white panels from behind which a blueish-white light poured out. Why the architects hadn't simply used windows was beyond her, but they were long dead, beyond memory really, and so such answers were beyond her.

It didn't stop her from wondering, for what little good it did.

Servants pressed their backs to the wall at her approach, their motion practiced and efficient. The moment she passed, they resumed their quick pace as though she'd never been there.

She slowed at the sound of voices coming from a pair of ornate doors. They opened from the right into a minor stateroom. She slowed as she approached and then stopped at the frame, careful to remain out of sight of anyone within. She listened to voices that carried the tone of a discussion, possibly verging into argument.

Good.

She took a deep breath and walked by the double doors, careful to keep her eyes forward and her gate quick. She only released that breath once she was beyond earshot.

She passed several more double doors, all closed, and turned into a smaller stair well. Two servants, both speaking in low voices, started at her approach and then quickly pressed their backs against the wall. It was unusual for a Royal to take the stairs, but not unheard of. She passed them without comment.

She exited into a smaller hall, walked to another set of stairs, descended further down, and wove deeper toward the spire's center, where fewer servants and more storage resided. She paused in front of a plain-looking door, made sure no one was around, and then stepped inside.

She fed the light panel just a trickle of energy, only enough to light up the small storage closet for a short time. A few steps took her to the back, where she pulled out a set of servant's clothes and quickly changed into them, then spared another few moments to tie up silky black hair into a tight bun. Without a mirror, she wasn't certain it matched their dress code perfectly, but it should be passable.

The light was fading, her trickle of energy almost used up, but she was done. She stepped out of the closet and walked back the way she came. She passed by the stairwell and continued until she came to another stairwell, this one spiraling almost the full height of the spire, all two hundred floors. She paused at the door and sighed. She had only twenty eight floors to climb down. The servants did this every day, often multiple times, but there was a reason all the servants had excellent physique, the same one that caused the Royals to avoid the stairs.

And she was a servant now, so stairs it was.

The servants did not press their backs to the wall as she descended, though they did shift to make way. Ostensibly, she was a servant now, though she could see tightened eyes, pressed lips, and the hint of a smile as they passed. They knew who she was.

But they would remain silent, and to any other, she would just be another servant beneath notice. That was the important part; it wasn't the servants she hid from.

She reached the ground floor and paused to stretch out an ache that had built in her knees. The stairs continued down, far beneath the earth, where the spire would split and twist out into multiple directions, very much like an absurdly symmetrical root system, only to link up with similar protrusions from the other spires. Not many realized that Castel's spires were, in fact, one building, or that the majority of it resided below ground. Of those that did, no one knew how extensive it all was. It didn't matter; most of the subterranean structure had long ago been abandoned and the spires were large enough to house whole townships anyway, so why delve the deep when they sky held more than enough room?

She exited the stairwell into a hallway behind the main lobby, quickly made her way around, strode quietly, confidently across lacquered stone. There was the usual assortment of citizens, Royals, and petitioners; none of them noticed her. Servants, she concluded, truly had a superpower. Would that she could go unnoticed like this more often.

She walked out glass doors that stood almost two stories high, held open by four guards dressed in immaculate white and gold livery with wooden swords strapped to their sides.

It was an absurd and excessive display of power: those swords were worth more than most cities. Having the door guards use them was obscene, but then her father had always been good at making statements.

One guard lingered on her as she passed, but none of them made a move to stop or question her. She wasn't sure if they recognized her or not. It's not like they had the authority to stop her, nor were they stupid enough to question whatever attire she decided to wear. She could walk out naked and probably get the same reaction.

Now _that_ was an interesting idea.

She shook her head and chased off the thought. Pranks like that belonged to her younger brothers, but she did sympathize with the need to throw off so much pomp as little more than a joke. More than sympathize, if this outing was any indication, but at least she chose to be smarter about it, or at least more circumspect.

Free of the central spire, she only had to walk the inner grounds, but that would take at least half an hour.

It was mid-morning, and already the heat was oppressive and filled with water. Even wearing all white, she had produced a light sheen of sweat before she'd made it halfway through the grounds. By the time she reached the wall, she was dripping.

The wall stood over three stories, also painted white; she swore the whole place had been designed to assault the eyes. She walked to a set of long, one-story buildings that abutted the wall, entered one, and was assaulted by a cacophony of noise.

It was a mess hall, but most of the benches and tables had been pushed to the edges. A crowd of soldiers had gathered around a cleared area in the center, where two of them, one hulking man and a smaller, muscular woman, were grappling. The others were cheering and she thought she saw money changing hands.

The game was simple. Touch the ground with anything but your feet and you loose. Leave the circle, and you loose. Grappling only: no fists, kicks, teeth, or nails, but otherwise, all is game.

The princess walked slowly around the edge toward the kitchen while watching the the two grapple. At first glance, the woman was clearly outmatched, but she suddenly launched herself at the man, who took a step back in surprise. She attached herself to his shoulder and let her momentum carry her feet around, where she shifted her grip to his neck, causing him to reflexively grab her arm. She yanked back hard. As he fell back, she pulled herself around the other side of him. He landed hard on his back with her straddling his chest.

She patted him on the cheek. "You're a fucking tree."

He grunted and pushed her off him. A lot money suddenly changed hands.

She jumped back into the circle and lifted her hands. "Next?"

The princess walked through the door to the kitchen as a wiry woman with a defiant expression stepped into the circle.

The kitchen was almost as noisy as the mess hall, but with far fewer voices and much more clanging. She walked in as though she owned the place, which wasn't far from the truth.

The head chef noticed her, immediately dropped what he was doing, followed her, then outpaced her to open a door toward the back. They both descended down a set of spiraled stairs that led into cold storage. At the basement floor, he fed a nearby panel with energy and lit up the room with sporadic lights that didn't quite provide enough light, only spots cast of blue luminance that refused to bleed beyond their bounds.

He drew ahead, his body alternating between light and shadow as he led her toward the back, where he pulled out a rugged looking sack and handed it to her. She reached inside, rummaged through it, but didn't find what she was looking for. She gave him a questioning look.

He let out a small sigh, then reached further into the shelf and pulled out a larger sack with some effort.

She reached for it, but he pulled it back out of her reach.

"Double," he said curtly, "for de illegal."

She flattened her gaze.

"None of that pri— ah..."

"Stasia."

"Right, well, _Stasia_, I did'na expect to store something illegal. Call it hazard pay."

She held her breath for a moment and wondered whether she should haggle for it. Yet, he wasn't wrong. The bag would earn him harsh fines if anyone found it in his possession, so in the end she simply nodded and pulled out a small roll of cash she'd stashed in her pants. She counted out double and then, after a moment's thought, added a few more. It wasn't like she couldn't afford it.

He took the money, grunted, gave her a nod of approval, and handed the bag over to her. She gasped in surprise at its weight.

She couldn't help but wonder if she'd overpaid, or otherwise had been taken advantage of, but she had no real reference to judge, so she dismissed it.

The chef walked away looking absurdly happy.

She dressed herself in cloths she pulled from the first bag. They were dirty, well worn, brown, a few holes in them, and generally looked like they belonged in the slums. They were, in other words, perfect... she hoped. Yet again, she was stuck by the realization that she wouldn't actually know. She should. This wasn't her first time out, and yet she couldn't dismiss the lingering doubt that everyone was simply pretending... because they always had, because they had to.

She shook off the thought and walked to a different door from the one she came down, slumped slightly from the weight of the bag. She exited into suffocating heat. Gods below, but she hated this place. Why was the only refuge from discomfort under ground?

She shook off that thought and followed the wall or, rather, the buildings that lined it. She hadn't come out far from her original entrance, so it was only a few minutes before she found herself at the gate.

This time, the guards definitely noticed her, and they gave her severe looks that suggested she was on the wrong side of the wall. She happily walked through.

Beyond was a massive bridge of gilded wood and stone that spanned the tributary to a nearby island. Thick, curved rods of structural gravwood were prominently stretched between the bridge towers; another show of power and money. Set foot on the opposite side, and the bridge would frame the center tower perfectly. At the right time of year, the setting or rising sun would compliment the view, the twisting spire set as though to spear the sun and drink its light... or, at least, that's how some unknown poet — one she suspected was in her father's employ — had described it. It was all marketing.

Marketing aside, the view was nice, incredible even for those who weren't born here or lived in the spires their whole life to slowly become jaded by wealth. Beauty took on sinister tones when it became required for survival.

She immediately turned left and took a small staircase that led below the bridge to a second, much more plain walkway suspended below, still wide but narrow enough that it was hidden from view. Just because you needed servants, didn't mean you wanted to see them walk in each day.

She felt tension ease in her shoulders as she walked completely anonymous. She could pretend she was nobody, a poor girl of no consequence, with no burden of state, no politics to manage, no false smiles and hidden knives, no seeing your best friend die by one of those knives, knowing the knife had been...

She faltered, gripped the railing, eyes closed while she pushed the memory down. Her white knuckled grip loosened by slow measures. After a minute or two, she took a deep breath; then she walked.

She was nobody, just a poor servant girl. Nobody could see her here, nobody cared.

She crossed over, made her way though and under buildings, most of them estates that often took up one or even more of the city's thousand islands. Only a few of the bridges had doubled layers for the servants, and before long she found herself on cobblestone streets, weaving through servants, merchants, couriers, and others, most well dressed and in a hurry.

She veered off onto a lessor road. The homes, while nice, were smaller with less pomp. The road had fewer people, presumably all attending their business, but the street was still respectable, clean, and safe.

The further she walked, the less the road became any of those things. The people looked either tired or dangerous, many of them loitered; some of them watched her, but most ignored the poor servant girl with a burden too heavy on her shoulder.

All these changes were gradual until she reached the crossing. It was a simple, worn stone bridge that had seen better days. It arced across a tributary into the maze, as most people called the slums; and it truly was a maze. She only knew the smallest part, a part she'd memorized for the endeavor. She was certain that nobody had ever truly memorized the maze. It was massive, spanning several of the inner tributaries and penetrating deep into the city proper.

Nobody knew why it was sandwiched in this way. It should be on the outskirts, at least so far as both the Royals and the merchants were concerned. Although, in truth, they both would rather not see the poor at all, not even on the outskirts. She'd come to realize the truth, though: they both depended on the slums for their labor, and so the labor had come to them, in all it's glorious dirt.

She shifted her clothes, careful to reveal a knife or two. The slums would ignore her for the most part, but there were certain elements that eyed a servant girl carrying a heavy bag as vulnerable. Her knives should dissuaded them from forfeiting their lives. Much better to attack someone who wasn't so blatantly armed.

The princess, even without the accruement of her station, was not someone to be trifled with.

Or at least she wasn't, until she was. She heard the steps behind her before the voice.

“Well, what do we have—“

Stasia spun to face them. “Are you lost?”

“Wha— ah, no?”

There were three of them, two boys and a girl, all wearing little more than dirty rags, with hardly better than sticks for weapons. They looked hungry, and nervous, and they eyed her bag.

“Then why are you following me?”

The larger of the boys shifted on his feet in indecision. His face firmed and he stepped forward.

“What's in the bag?”

“Because if you are lost, I would suggest you head that way,” she gestured back the way she came with her knife, a very well made knife that would fetch a year's worth of money for any of them, a knife no one would be foolish to brandish here unless they could use it.

All thee of her would-be attackers suddenly forgotten the bag, their eyes glued to the knife, doubt on their faces.

The boy who spoke first looked confused. It was expected. Most people didn't brandish knives when they were outnumbered. It took time to reconcile the fact that the oh-so-vulnerable person you sought to take advantage of actually wasn't vulnerable and, in fact, could end you with little more than a flick of the wrist.

She watched patiently as all these truths flickered across the boy's face. She noted the moment he chose wisely.

“Ah— yes, sorry to bother you, my lady, but I think you're right. We should be... ah, going. Sorry to bother you.”

And with that, the boy turned suddenly and walked through the other two, who hesitated only a moment before following him back the way they'd come.

Five more blocks, two changes of direction, one dark looking alley that was probably safer than the safe-looking ones, and Stasia had found her destination.

A man with dark brown hair, thin face, lean build, leaned against the wood exterior of one of the buildings. Otherwise, there was no one around. He pushed himself off the wall and placed himself behind a small foldable table; he couldn't have looked more like a charlatan if he tried.

He smiled deep and broad as she approached. "Welcome my dear lady, to the illicit emporium." She had to suppress a shudder at the way he lingered on 'illicit'.

She plopped the bag on table, then rolled her shoulder to loosen the burning sensation that had built from the walk. The man frowned at the bag.

"That it?"

She gave him a single nod.

His eyes darkened in anger. "What are you trying for? This ain't the deal."

"It is, check."

He didn't bother. "You should have at least six bags, girl. You try to short us and there won't be anything left of you to find."

Stasia rolled her eyes. "Just check the bag."

He stared at her for several seconds in what she could only think was an attempt to intimidate, though at this point all it really did was force her to hold back another eye roll. He slowly reached down and opened the bag, looked down, then frowned in confusion. "What _is_ that?"

"Dresh, compacted."

He lifted out what looked like a dark-green brick. "This ain't dresh. It's... I don't what this is, but it ain't dre— huh, it smells like dresh."

"Compacted. What I say?" She kept her words short and clipped in her best attempt to mimic the slang. Too many words would make it obvious she did not belong.

"Never seen anything like this."

"How else was I to get it here?"

"Not my problem," he mumbled and then, to her horror, licked the block. He stumbled back, coughed, and leaned on the table to catch his breath. "Fuck... that's... ugh," he shook his head and blinked slowly, "potent."

"Compacted," Stasia shook her head in exasperation, "what I say? You can't just _lick_ a block like that."

"Got it. Yep, won't do that again."

She took a deep breath while she waited for him to compose himself. Dresh, in its normal form, would make everything brighter, better, but surreal, like it was the same world but painted in bright colors. The world felt new on dresh, and made people happy, if only for a short time. Of course, take too much, and it would just give a headache as the world became so bright that not even closing your eyes would keep it out.

"Okay, I'm good," he said after a couple minutes.

Stasia snorted; the man's eyes were still dilated, tears ran down his face, and he kept angling it toward the shadows.

"Clearly, I've kept my side. You're turn," Stasia said.

The man winced at her voice, but reached under the table and removed a box secured to the the underside. Clever. The table must fold up into some kind of briefcase. He placed the box on the table, then turned his head away, clearly in pain.

The box had been stained a deep brown, almost black, with a ornate design she'd never seen before. She touched it lightly, feeling the smooth lacquer, a smile on her face as she imagined the relics within. She picked it up and took her time looking it over. There was no latch, no obvious way to open it. To most people, it would look like a solid piece, a weird jewelry box with no way to open. She closed her eyes, trailed her fingers over the edges, sides, feeling it out. As she did, she pushed energy against the wood, looking for some inlet she knew must be there.

"Do you need a moment, a room maybe?" the man said.

She ignored him, and continued to feel it out. After a couple minutes she detected variations, places where the energy could slip in. There would be ten places, each requiring a varied amount of energy delivered in a specific pattern. It had taken her over a year to find out what that pattern was, and it cost her several times more than the box itself did. But there was no other way to open it. The box would be practically indestructible, and those things that could destroy it, would also destroy what was inside. It was supreme irony that she managed to purchase it for a mere bag of compacted dresh. They'd sold something worth more than a palace for little more than a few highs.

She found the last spot, twisted her fingers around the box, lightly touching each invisible entry point, took a deep breath, and fed the box a complicated pattern of energy.

The top of the box slid open in multiple pieces along invisible seams. Inside were two wooden, double-bladed knives, their color a deep brown tinted red, which betrayed the wood as elder core, the mark of a relic.

As she picked the knives up, the man hissed. "Price just went up, girl... a lot."

She shook her head. "Deal is done."

"No... no way. That's a relic—"

"That you sold for a bag of dresh... yes, I know."

"Then you should understand why I have to do this."

She looked up from the knives as he pulled a sword out from— actually, she had no idea where he'd been storing it. His pant leg maybe? It was short, closer to a long knife than even a short sword, but it was well made, expensive, even if it was only steel.

She fed energy into the knives and felt the anchor take hold. It was a weird sensation, something she'd only read about, but it would tie her to the knives. She flicked the knife out toward a nearby building, pushing energy into it just as she let go. The knife sped toward the building far faster than she threw it, then continued on _through_ the building as though nothing was there. She sensed it pass through several more walls before she _pulled_ it back to herself. The knife, somewhere in the next alley over, suddenly reversed direction and came flying back at her.

The knife veered toward her hand as it approached. She caught it in the middle without needing to look; the anchor had given her a very accurate sense of it.

The man stared at the building, looking confused, or just disbelieving what he'd seen. He blinked away more tears, and turned to her with eyes still dilated. "Hand it over, girl."

"Are you stupid? Did you not see what I did?"

"I saw, and all it told me was I need those back." He gave her a wry smile, then whistled.

Nothing happened.

He looked around, confused.

"Problem?" Although she had no idea what he thought would happen; more men, maybe?

He whistled again, this time with a little more urgency.

Nothing continued to happen.

He began to curse, and without warning stabbed at her in an ill-conceived attempt to catch her off guard. To be fair, this had worked for him in the past and, while it was cowardly to attack a woman — or anyone, for that matter — without warning, everyone he'd done this to was dead and so obviously unable to complain about it.

Stasia wasn't just anybody. She was a princess, a Royal. Royals were, to put it mildly, vicious; and to even survive childhood required training, far more training than he could have ever dreamed of. So while his surprise attack might have worked on most people, she saw it coming far in advance.

Her problem wasn't his attack; it was more a question of how to properly deal with the situation. There was no downside to him killing her and taking the knives while delivering the dresh to her real client; he was just a courier, after all. But she still had need of a courier, because that bag needed to get back to her client or she would burn some very good contacts.

At the same time, she couldn't allow an attack on her person to go unpunished.

She decided, quite rationally, that he would still be able to deliver the bag with only one arm. So as he thrust his sword in a highly telegraphed move, she leaned out of the way and sent one of her newly acquired knives through his upper arm, severing flesh, tendons, and bone with virtually no effort.

The man screamed a high pitched sound she wasn't even sure she could achieve. He grabbed his arm as blood began to pour out, stumbled, fell, and began to roll around on the ground while he whimpered and moaned.

Stasia stared at him in confusion. Sure, having your arm punctured like that was traumatic, but it was a clean cut, and the body simply shouldn't have registered pain yet. If anything, she would have expected him to stare at the wound in shock before gradually coming to grips with reality.

Then she realized: the dresh, it would have heightened his senses, all of them. Dresh was popular in both the pleasure houses and for less reputable means of attaining information.

She sighed as she watched him drench the street in blood. With a few quick cuts, she removed his shirt, wrapped it around his arm, and tied it tight enough to stem the blood flow. She dragged him out of the street and tried to prop him up against the side of the building, but he passed out from the pain and fell over.

Probably for the best. She placed the bag of dresh under his head and hoped her friends, if that was what he was counting on, would find him soon. She had no intention of sticking around. She grabbed the box from the ground, which had been knocked off the table in their scuffle, and head back the way she came.

All she had to do now was get back into the spire without anyone knowing she'd been gone.
