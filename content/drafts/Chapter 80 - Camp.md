# 80 | Camp

The fire drew his eyes first, then up to follow a pillar of smoke that bent away and dissipated into an even layer of thick clouds slowly marching across the sky. Winter’s wrath had already begun to drive away the day’s light, leaving the fire the only source of oranges and reds to signal the day’s end. Those flickering oranges lit up at least a dozen large tents, with smaller ones cast about in a pattern that only hinted at organization, as though organization knew what to do but had been too damn tired to make a full attempt.

Throughout the tents could be spotted people sitting around the fire eating, presumably food. He blinked slowly. Of course it was food, what else would people eat? His eyes lingered on their bowls as his stomach growled reawakened need. He caught flashes of others through the tents and toward the back thought there might be a line, though why people in a camp would stand in a line was beyond him.

They stood elevated enough for him to see the end of the camp, maybe, but not discern a true count of the expedition. It was dozens, for certain.

Dozens of people. His heart picked up its pace and fed a slick feeling in his hands. He didn’t know how to handle so many people, what to say or do. Neither Rose nor Ellie offered anything remotely like normal interactions, and he realized that he might just be more ill-prepared for people than he was for the mountain.

He didn’t belong here among them. He didn’t belong among any people. He suddenly felt like a monster hiding in plain sight, just moments from being revealed as the twisted creation he was.

“You’ll be fine.”

Roland jumped at Jonah’s voice beside him. The man had stood there silently the entire time, unnoticed by a boy too distracted to pay attention to anything except the scene before him. That should never have happened.

“You’re among friends now, or, well, most of them. Just don’t get in Fin’s way and he won’t shoot you, probably.”  Jonah chuckled lightly at his joke, then cut short at Roland’s expression. “Hey now, you’ll be fine. Like I said, we’re all friends here.”

Friends. And suddenly he felt hungry all over again.

“Come. I’ll introduce you,” Jonah said, then walked away in a confident stride without looking back. He was used to be followed. Roland briefly flirted with running away but the thought refused to solidify under another wave of hunger, and after only a moment’s hesitation he found his feet following of their own accord.

Conversation stopped and eyes turned as he followed close behind Jonah. Behind, Roland left a trail of whispers and stares. Skyra was still curled up around his shoulders, somehow capable of sleeping through all the noise, and he felt every ounce of her weight.

Jonah wove a path around the fire, through the smaller of the tents, and then back toward the larger ones behind. To the left a line of almost a dozen people had lined up at a particular tent, with Stan and Fin making up the tail, which struck Roland as odd. Realization hit him at almost the same time as a scent of food assaulted his nose. It was food tent.

Roland stared at it in longing as Jonah led him away toward a small group of people conversing in front another tent with the side rolled up. Inside was were several foldable chairs around a wooden table piled with papers, held down with smooth rocks.

“Alister,” Jonah said to a surprisingly well-dressed individual, “this here is Roland. We found him alone, some good ways from the camp.”

Alister eyes briefly acknowledging Jonah before resting on Roland, whereby he blinked slowly, his expression taken back, mouth mid-open with no sound. He seemed torn between Roland and Skyra, whom his eyes kept returning to as though to ensure he wasn’t actually seeing things. He opened his mouth to speak, then stopped short, opened it again, frowned, and finally seemed to catch onto the fact that Roland was armed, or perhaps is was simply his clothes.

“A failed expedition,” he said slowly, though both statement and question seemed intermingled in his tone. “Yes,” he nodded as though to convince himself, “and well-sponsored by the looks of you. But you managed to survive out here alone... remarkable.”

It was as good a lie as Roland could think of, so he nodded, a little surprised by how well they’d unwittingly setup a ruse for him to hide behind.

“Right. Well, I can’t say I ever expected to meet anyone new out here but you’re certainly welcome here so long as you play by our rules.”  He paused, his tone turned hard, eyes flinty until Roland nodded again. His eyes immediately softened, giving Roland the impression the man was expert at manipulating, or leadership... he wasn’t sure there was a difference here. “Good. Now, I’m sure you know I cannot offer any of the group’s shares — bound by contract, of course — but I’ll be damned if you haven’t at least earned enough money to find your way home. You’ll have that, my promise, providing we survive this place. Will that be a problem?”

Roland shook his head slowly, surprised by the offer, but then any group so besieged as they must be would welcome any help, no matter how strangely it may be packaged.

“Good. Now feel free to get some food and I’ll see about getting you a place to sleep. Come morning, we’ll need to discuss what you can contribute.” He paused, his eyes narrowing slightly, and took in Roland all over again. “But perhaps that won’t be an issue if you were able to survive out here for any time.”

He surprised Roland by offering his hand which Roland took and returned a hard handshake. Alister paused, raised his brow, then seemed to throw off the weirdness of it all with a deep breath before turning back to Jonah.

“Now let’s hear what you found...”

Obviously dismissed, Roland turned and startled to see Anna standing next to him. There were too many people and things to keep track of, and he was too distracted by the newness of it all. He should never have allowed anyone so close to him unaware. He took a deep breath to calm himself.

“We have food,” she said with a bright smile that faltered slightly as she took him in, “and you... really need some. Come on.”

She grabbed his hand and tried to pull but, as usual, instinct took over and he flinched back. Hurt briefly flickered across her face before covered.

“Sorry,” Roland replied, his throat caught though, so it came out raspy, “it’s just—“

“No, it’s okay. You’ve been out here for... right, anyway, you’ve gotta be famished.”

She smiled a gentle, wary smile and offered her hand again, which he took. He allowed her to pull him away while he fought off a shaky, lightheaded feeling. Anna pointed out various people of note in the camp, the personality, and role in the expedition. He heard nothing of what she said, and everything of how she said it. Her tone held a curious accent that only accentuated the exotic air that had so attracted him. He found himself admiring the way she walked, her grace, how she moved, and more than once had to stop himself from attempting to eye curves hidden beneath her coat.

They arrived at the food pavilion before Roland even realized they’d walked the distance. He flinched, and his eyes darted. Yet again, he’d allowed himself to become distracted. All of these foreign emotions and fears prevented him from noticing what was around him. He’d be dead had Rose been here. He closed his eyes and forced everything down until the sea of emotions finally reflected a calm, empty surface.

“Are you okay?”

Roland opened his eyes. “Yeah. I guess it’s just...”

“Overwhelming?”

He nodded.

“I guess it would be, wouldn’t it? How long have you been out here?”

“Leave the poor boy alone and let him get some food!”

Roland turned to see another woman serving up the stew. The cook, maybe? She was older, with a wiry frame and wizened features that gave her a kindly, almost grandmotherly look. He was surprised to find someone that old here, assuming they wouldn’t be accepted.

“Oh, now, don’t give me that look. You wouldn’t believe how many shares they give for an experienced cook,” she said with a wink. She took out a bowl and filled it with the stew before handing it over to Roland. “Come back if you want more.”

“Such lies. You got half share, and we’re lucky your so-called food hasn’t killed us!” said a rather large man, whom Roland thought had to be one of the loggers.

“Double share.”

“More like a third share.

“And that’s, what... your third bowl for the night?” the cook said with a wry smile that suggested they did this often.

“Come on, let’s go sit by the fire,” Anna said and drew him away from the cook. Roland looked back to see the cook holding the man’s bowl hostage with an imperious look on her face.

They walked over to one of the empty benches placed a decent distance from the fire. The light made him nervous. He never made a fire in the forest, ever, no matter how cold it got.

“Why do you make a fire?”

Anna looked a little confused, “What do you mean?”

“It’s just that you shouldn’t actually need it. You don’t use it for cooking and there are better alternatives for light and heat.”

“So?”

“So. You announce yourself to the entire forest this way. It’s... unwise.”

“I can’t be that bat. Besides, it’s easier than operating a bunch of warmers or lights, and it gives our loggers something to do.”  She shifted her gaze to the fire. “In truth, I think we do it because we like the fire, makes us feel safe.”

He gave her a skeptical look. They were literally sacrificing their survival so that they could feel safe? It was absurd.

She frowned at him in response, “Didn’t your expedition do something similar? I thought this was standard.”

He blanched at revealing his ignorance. He should have known this sort of thing, so he gave her a half-hearted shrug.

She turned haunted eyes back to the fire. “Sounds like they weren’t prepared, not that any of us ever can be.”

Her expression had been emptied of something vital, hope. He considered what this might be like for them. They’d lost people, and though he didn’t know how many, it was clearly enough to threaten the expedition. He knew very little of these kinds of excursions except they rarely returned, though those who do always ended up wealthy. They must have thought they would be the exception, only to find themselves picked off one by one.

She turned and drew his attention from the fire. “So, what was it like living alone in the forest? I can’t believe you survived. Sometimes I can’t believe—”

“He obviously did it by hiding,” said a voice from behind.

Anna looked back and shot Fin a withering look. He grunted and then shooed at her with his hand, the other holding a bowl. For a moment, Roland thought — hoped — she would deny him, but she scooted closer to Roland to make room and pressed against him.

“I didn’t hide,” he replied distractedly as he tried not to think of Anna’s closeness. His head suddenly felt wooden and slow.

“Oh right, sure. You just walked up to the largest beat in the forest and cut its head right off.”  Fin scoffed. “Please, you spend all your time hiding in holes, shaking in fear. You couldn’t use that sword if your life depended on it.”

Roland blinked in shock, the man actually thought the Linrix was the largest beast here.

“And you think you could do better?” Anna said with a venomous look. “He_survived_, more than we can say for you.”

“I’m quite hale, thank you.”

“Hale,” she said as she screwed up her face, “do you even know what the word means?”

Fin flashed her a smug smile and began eating as Stan sat down on the other side of Roland with his own bowl. He glanced at Fin and Anna, raised an eyebrow at Anna’s scowl, and then leaned over to Roland.

“They arguing again?”

“About me, I think.”

He gave Roland a considered look. “Hmmm... not used to the attention?”

Roland shook his head. “Not like that.”

“Don’t worry too much about it. Fin just takes an adjustment period is all.”

Stan chuckled as though laughing at a private joke. He ate and for a time the group descended into something that might have been called affable silence, or at least a tolerant silence. Roland finished his bowl quickly, but his stomach felt empty. He couldn’t recall being quite this hungry in a long time.

He got up and refilled his bowl but when he returned Fin had gone. He felt some relief at that.

“What’s his deal?”

“Who, Fin?” Stan replied, though he kind of directed the question to Anna.

“Yeah.”

“Fin’s just... he’s difficult when he feels threatened.”

“I threaten him?”

Stan chuckled while Anna answered. “No, but he’s wanted a gravtech sword for a long time and thinks it’s his right for mastering the blade. Finding a boy in this forest, of all places, carrying one...” She shrugged but glanced at his sword on his back with the obvious question in her eyes. He had no idea how to even begin to answer where it came from.

He caught a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye as something came flying at him. In an instant, he’d snapped a shield in place, retrieved a knife, and had come within a hair’s breadth from releasing it, his arm outstretched with a blade in fingertips.

Silence descended over the group as something clacked against his shield. Stan had jumped up and looked at Roland with new eyes, alarmed and curious. Fin also had a startled expression that shifted into something like recognition. Anna, though, had her eyes glued to his knife with a hand beneath her coat. There was a shock on her face along with recognition that somehow gave way to anger.

Roland glanced down to see a wooden practice sword lying next to him. His eyes flicked to Fin in question.

“Think you deserve that sword? Prove it.” He had his own practice sword in hand.

Anna shook off a glaze and turned her anger on Fin. “Gods, Fin, give it up.” She turned to Roland. “Just ignore him.”

“Oh no, if he wants to be part of this group, he needs to prove he can handle himself. We’re not on some vacation tour here.”

“Roland, you don’t need to do this. Besides, he’s a master with that blade.” Turning to Fin, Anna said, “You know this isn’t fair. You’ve trained for—”

“I’ll do it.”
