# 46 | Rabbit [Roland]

Leaves fell in a slow but constant sprinkle that covered the forest with a rainbow of sunset colors. The sun was well on its way to noon, but did less than usual to bring about the day's heat. The cooling winds of autumn already waged war against the its fire. Even with the chill, Roland sweat heavily as he very slowly, very carefully stalked through the forest in an effort to remain as silent as possible.

He hadn't gone far. A few minutes jog would bring him home but he'd been out here hours for what was supposed to be a simple task.

Find and catch a rabbit.

Why? He had no idea. Probably, it was just a new phase in his training, though how catching rabbits could be considered training was beyond him. Or, perhaps, she'd finally grown tired of him and this was her way of throwing him out of the house. It was a delightful thought, though not a likely scenario. She displayed none of the irritation that should normally accompany such ejections.

He'd argued of course, but barely more than a token effort. He knew better than to risk his first opportunity for a day to himself. All he had to do was catch a rabbit and he would be free for the rest of the day; the taste of it was intoxicating.

His task was deceptively simple, but he couldn't use a trap, because apparently that's cheating? He hadn't even _thought_ to use a trap until she mentioned it. Perhaps she thought he would come back too early. If so, she clearly did not know him at all. He fully intended to spend the entire day outside.

It took only a couple hours to realize his first problem. He couldn't find the rabbits. It should have been easy. Rabbits are plentiful, and they breed... well, like rabbits. He'd seen them a lot over the months, yet now that he went to actually find one of them, they utterly disappeared. After much furious searching, he concluded they didn't exist. Rabbits were a fantasy devised to make excuses for why certain crops were eaten. They were gremlins, those things mother claimed ate socks. No matter that he'd seen rabbits before, he now saw the truth for what it was: Rabbits were a fantasy.

It took an embarrassingly long time to realize the problem. He'd searched through the forest, looking for rabbits, all the while crashing through the leaves with such a noise as to alert everything in a league. Of course, he hadn't found any rabbits. He'd chased them off long before he ever had a chance to see one.

The solution was simple: he need but move through the forest quietly and then he would find his rabbits. He should have been good at it — he'd spent plenty of time silently stalking Sal, after all — but the leaves were obscenely loud, and every move he made, every twitch, shift, or scratch he had seemed to somehow result in a crunch with the sound of a thousand breaking branches.

So instead of catching rabbit, he spent hours learning how to stalk through the forest without noise.

It felt suspiciously like training. Stalking— real stalking, not the play stuff he used to do— was hard work, far harder than he'd ever expected, and nothing like his adventures. Moving silently involved muscles he never knew existed and required balance he did not have. In the end, he took his boots off, which helped more than he thought it should. He still fell a lot, often after teetering on one foot with no idea where to place the next.

It took him a few hours of practice, but he'd gone almost ten minutes without any sound at all— well, or mostly without sound; at the very least, he was quieter. He was also drenched in sweat, and his muscles ached, and his head swam, but now, for the first time, he saw his first... rabbit?

Do rabbits have horns? He cocked his head and forced himself to crouch slowly through trembling muscles. He didn't think so. He'd never seen a rabbit with horns nor ever heard anyone mention a rabbit with horns. He was pretty sure they shouldn't have horns. Maybe it wasn't a rabbit after all. Perhaps a small ram? But it really looked like a rabbit...

He watched the horned-rabbit as it sniffed through the leaves. The horns were small and tightly curled, like ram horns, but this certainly was no ram, which was obvious, of course, yet confusing all the same. Rabbits and rams were very rarely, if ever, confused for one another, and yet there he was, confusing them.

It hopped over to a nearby tree.

Okay, definitely a rabbit; rams don't hop... wait, did they? He wasn't actually sure.

He violently shook his head to dispel the whole ram thing. It wasn't a ram, obviously.

The _rabbit_ hopped around to the other side of the tree, which provided as good an opportunity as he would get to sneak up on it.

He half-raised himself from a crouch and slowly lifted his leg to seek his next step. He found the best spot he could and slowly shimmied his foot in between the leaves, onto the soft loam of the forest floor.

So far, so good.

He repeated this many more times. He strained as he silently snuck up on the tree, which he imagined was what it looked like. He felt ridiculous as he stalked vegetation that could never move. Whatever the rabbit had found on the other side must have been interesting... or it was gone. He really hoped it wasn't gone.

He had almost made it to the tree when the rabbit hopped out in front of him. They both stared at each other in shocked surprise.

He leapt at it with a kind of reckless abandon available only to children. He landed hard as his elbows dug into the ground, arms outstretched as he gathered the—

Where was the rabbit?

He frowned and furrowed his brow as he frantically sorted through the leaves under him. Nothing, no rabbit.

He looked up to find it standing by another tree, its head cocked to the side in blatant mockery. He clenched his jaw and scowled at the mirth dancing in its eyes.

That tree was at least a dozen paces away, and he saw no leaves disturbed between him and it. Was it another rabbit? He looked around, but no, nothing hid nearby.

He took a deep breath and pushed the frustration down. Whichever rabbit this was, he still needed to capture it. And it was a rabbit, he was certain. Not a ram. It _was_ a rabbit, and it must have hopped... several dozen paces. Sure.

He remained still and stared at it for a few minutes before it lost interest and began to root around in the leaves. As it did, he slowly got up and, paying careful attention to disturb as few leaves as possible, began to stalk the elusive creature again.

Every once in a while, the animal would twitch, or freeze, or lookup. When it did, he would freeze, even if it meant balancing on one foot. It would stare at him for a moment, decide he was harmless, and go back to its incessant rooting.

Rabbits, he decided, were stupid animals. He spent the next hour sneaking up on one.

Frustration built at the idiocy of attempting to sneak up on something that clearly knew he was there. It was like a game, a sadistic one where if the rabbit was looking, he couldn't move, and it always chose the worst times to look up. But as long as it was distracted, he could move so long as he did so silently. A few times he almost got in reach of the cursed beast only to watch it idly hop a few paces away to a new rooting ground.

It was taunting him, it had to be. Nothing randomly moved like that. Stupid, evil animal. By the time he managed to get within lunging distance, his jaw ached from clenching. He did it though, he got in reach.

With neurotic eyes wide and glued to his prey, he lunged.

Halfway into the lunge, the rabbit startled and then, as though shot from a bow, it snapped through the air and rammed a nearby tree with a clack. He was so startled he didn't even bother to cushion his fall. He landed hard on his shoulder as his hands reflexively followed the animal. Pain shot through his arm but he ignored it, his face frozen in an exasperated expression while he watched the rabbit shake its head, calmly turned around, and stare back at him in triumph.

In that moment, he never hated anything so much as that rabbit.

It didn't take long for the rabbit to return to its rooting. Roland stood up without bothering to remain silent; what was the point? The demon rabbit stiffened but didn't run. A moment later, it returned to its obnoxious behavior.

He reigned in his frustration and pondered for a minute. This clearly was no ordinary rabbit. Yes, it had horns, and those were odd, but the way it moved was not natural. One moment it was in front of him, the next flying toward a tree, something he was as sure rabbits didn't do as he was that it was a rabbit and not, say, a ram. Rabbits don't fly, and they don't ram trees. Of course, they also don't have horns, but he was willing to let that one slide.

He replayed the event over and over again and concluded the horns were meant to protect its head when it hit the tree. Odd and weird, but effective. No wonder they were such dumb animals, all that head-banging couldn't be good for their intelligence.

It was almost as if it had been attracted to the tree for somehow.

He chewed his cheek in thought. All creatures in the forest use gravics. That's what Rose had said the night he ran away. He hadn't been in the mood to listen at the time, but it felt important now.

He glanced over at the tree, a Whitewood. Its branches were bone white and its leaves were already bleaching themselves for their transition to winter. The whole tree would remain white for weeks, then bleed into a deep red at first snow.

He stared at it for a long time as his mind danced around half-remembered dreams of flying through a forest. The tree grew large. It drew him in with a weight that felt more real than anything around it. As it grew, so did others fill his mind until it seemed as though he stood in a forest of nothing but Whitewoods. All the rest of the world had faded away.

A twig cracked; his eyes snapped open; he looked around, confused, uncertain of when he'd closed them. A motion drew his head toward the rabbit, who was hopping to a new rooting ground.

He took a deep breath and narrowed his eyes at the rooting rabbit. He decided he would call it 'Horny.' Juvenile, yes, but satisfying, and names were important, especially when dealing with an arch nemesis. So yes, he now had a proper name for his demon rabbit.

That taken care of, he once again began the meticulous process of stalking Horny, the horned demon-rabbit.

Horny had become used to him. It didn't mind his bumbling through the leaves anymore; it didn't raise its head at his every move; it didn't run away or flee. Even when he approached, it barely paid him any mind at all. Obviously, whatever it rummaged for under so many orange and brown leaves was far more important this bumbling, small creature who stalked it.

It truly was a stupid animal.

And yet two more attempts over the next two hours failed to yield the demon to his arms.

His legs were water, he'd run out of sweat, and his frustration maintained a tight-lidded boil beneath his skin.

He looked up and tracked the sun. It was well past lunch, verging into late afternoon. He hadn't eaten. The sun had already burned away so many of his dreams of idleness and play. His stomach growled at him, and for a moment became the loudest sound in the forest.

Now _that_ was an idea. What do rabbits eat? Would Rose consider it a trap if he just offered it food? No, too easy. Rose wouldn't allow it, he had no idea what to offer it, and no food on him anyway, which suddenly seemed a glaring oversight on several fronts.

He needed a new tact. Lunging didn't work; no matter how hard he tried— the thing was simply too fast. But maybe he could get closer now that it was used to him and snatch it. Sure, snatching might seem like lunging but it was different in his mind and, more importantly, he was sure he could do it.

He once again began the painstaking process of stalking his arch nemesis, Horny. It didn't take nearly as long this time. Horny just wasn't as bothered by his presence anymore, and this allowed him to move a little easier, a little quicker, a little closer. Half an hour later and he was again within lunging distance.

He waited.

And he waited.

And he waited.

The sun moved at a languid pace, but its light already veered into oranges that turned leaves into brilliant amber in patches and streaks along the forest floor.

And still he waited as Horny came near, then further, then back again. It didn't matter, Roland was nothing but the forest itself, little more than a tree. Harmless, forgettable, ignorable—

He snatched Horny by the tail and tried to draw it to his chest, but Horny ripped free and flew away with a power that resonated within Roland like a gong.

Roland fell back on his tailbone, stunned.

He _felt_ it. Whatever Horny had done, he felt it resonate. It felt alien, dangerous, and... familiar. But how? How could it feel familiar?

He looked down at his hand, which held a tuft of fur. He looked at Horny, confused. Finally, he harrumphed and stuck his tongue out at the beast. The horned demon shook itself off, gave Roland one last aggrieved look, then buried its nose in the leaves.

Roland turned his attention inward.

It had felt so peculiar and familiar, and that made no sense.

He closed his eyes and tried to find it. Like the twitch of an ill-used muscle, more something forgotten than unknown. He felt around, poked, prodded, but might as well have poked darkness itself. Whatever it was, he would not find it this way. He pinched his lips in frustration and opened his eyes.

Horny rooted, ignorant, oblivious. It ignored him as inconsequential, which was an infuriatingly accurate assessment. He glared at the stupid hell-spawn as he watched it bury its nose around the base of a Whitewood.

A quick inhale stole his breath. The tree. It always flew toward a Whitewood. They were the key. He'd known this, though, hadn't he? He'd always known they were the answer.

He stared at the tree for a long time, and allowed it to fill his perception, consume his senses. There was something more real about it, something tangible. He'd done this before, felt this before. He recognized the weight of it. It resonated, called to him. He needed but _pull_ —

And suddenly Roland was raking the forest floor with his face.

He let go and spat out dirt and leaves.

A giggle escaped his lips.

That had been incredible! The tree had become down, and he'd _fallen_ toward it. He rolled onto his back and laughed. His face hurt, his legs were weak, he was dehydrated and hungry, and he'd flown. Granted, it was painful, and he really should keep his face out the dirt, but... Roland Anselm could _fly_.

He slowly sat up, a smile still plastered to his face. Horny stared at him like he was crazy, which was probably true and didn't matter in the least. That demon's time would come soon. But first... first he would practice flying.

He giggled again.

It was harder than he'd thought it would be. He quickly discovered sitting or standing while he _pulled_ were bad ideas. Both attempts ended up with his face buried into the ground, usually after tripping. Also, he could trip while sitting down; that was a novel experience he'd prefer not to repeat. He decided to try something else after several attempts.

Running was altogether different. By running toward a tree, he could _pull_ on that tree to propel himself forward. Of course, that also meant driving him toward the tree, which had limited usefulness. A few hard crashes, and he began to envy the rabbit its horns.

But _jumping_ was incredible.

He discovered that he could move the ‘anchor' point on the tree. It naturally seemed to pull from his chest, but with practice, he could focus it wherever he wanted. Thus he discovered the art of running, jumping, and then _flying_... at least for a few seconds.

Those seconds were divine freedom. In those seconds, the wind caressed his hair, his body and self free, far above the ground, as he assaulted the falling leaves with his person before he plummeted back to the earth into a tangled ball of limbs. It hurt like hell, and it was great, and it tasted sweet like nothing he'd ever known before.

He craved it in the deepest parts of his soul.

His next attempt was to try pulling on more than one tree at a time, but that yielded only disaster. He simply couldn't predict his direction. A tree twice as far away seemed to require far more _pull_ than one at half the distance. After several attempts and one hard smack against a random tree, he realized he would not manage it anytime soon.

It didn't matter. He'd found his first super power. He could _fly_... well, sort of— More like he could jump really high, but whatever, this was what he needed. It was the very thing Rose feared, a thing his alone she could not control.

He wanted to keep trying, to become better. He wanted days or even months of just this, but the sun hung low in the sky and imposed a sense of urgency in its descent.

He needed a rabbit, and he needed it now.

He looked around and was surprised to see the demon-rabbit idly rooting about a little distance away. He'd have figured it would scare off with all the running, jumping, and crashing he'd done for the past hour or so, but no, it seemed quite content to keep its oblivious nose buried nearby.

Stupid animal. Cute though, and considerate of it to hang around.

Perhaps sensing the sudden quiet, it looked up at him, and he felt a fondness for the creature. It had taught him something incredible. He smiled at it.

Then he had a horrible idea; his smile broadened into a grin.

It had weight, just like the trees. Maybe not as heavy, but he could sense it. Perhaps all living things did, or perhaps even all things, but for now all that mattered was he could sense Horny.

He _pulled_ on the cute, horned, demon-rabbit.

Rabbits don't weigh much, not really, and especially not compared to a twelve-year-old boy. But they don't weigh nothing, and Roland stumbled forward from the pull. That might have been fine had it not triggered something instinctual within Horny, who also _pulled_ on him in return. The result was a surprised boy skipping across the forest toward a horned bunny that barreled toward him at over twice its normal speed.

In that moment, it occurred to him then that its horns might actually work as an offensive weapon, though the irony of this was lost within a yelp of surprise.

They crashed together with a loud crack. His feet slid out from under him and left him on his back with a sharp pain in his chest that made it hard to breathe. Horny sat on top of him, looking alarmed and confused. Despite the pain, he kept enough of a presence of mind to grab Horny with both arms. The rabbit, perhaps still in shock, didn't bother to put up a fight.

He groaned as he got up, Horny in hand. The rabbit was shaking, so he stroked its soft fur in an attempt to sooth it.

“It's okay, little one. We'll just show you to Rose, and then you can go free.”

He whispered soothing sounds and continued to pet it as he held it close. It relaxed into his arms by increments until it began to lightly rub its teeth together in a purr. He was surprised and delighted at how quickly it calmed. Perhaps it had grown used to him after all this time; perhaps it had learned to like him.

It shivered when he started to walk again, but soon settled back down. He found his boots a surprising distance away, set the rabbit down, tied the boots together and slung them over his elbow, picked up the rabbit — which had amazingly remained still — and then headed back toward home. Barely half of his attention was on where he walked, most of it dominated by the purring creature in his arms.

Would Rose let him keep the rabbit? It seemed impossible. His training dominated everything, and yet he could not let go of that slim hope. Could he hide it, keep it in his room? Rose had never entered his room except for that first day. He could make it a little home to sleep on, maybe even cuddle with it.

But it would be cruel to keep a rabbit? He had no time to take care of it, no food to give it, and nothing with which to make a home for it. He barely spent any time in his room aside from sleep, and that little enough as it was. He looked down and clutched it closer as he stroked its fur. It would be cruel to—

“_What_ did you do to your face?”

He looked up and blinked hard. He'd absently walked into the courtyard without realizing it. Rose was outside on a wooden chair, a book set aside as she stared at him with an expectant and surprised look.

He reached up to feel his face. There was dirt, of course, scratches, and he suspected more than a few bruises. It hurt to breathe, ribs likely cracked, his legs shook, body dirty and bruised, and his clothes torn. It was no worse than normal aside from the dirt, but he felt better for it, successfull... happy.

He gave a small shrug so as not to disturb Horny.

She shook off a light sense of wonder at his condition and trailed her eyes down to Horny. He reflexively clutched the rabbit closer.

“Excellent, he's calm; that will make this a lot easier. Bring him here.”

She led him around the back of the house, over to a small table set against the side. It was taller than he was used to, forcing him to use a stool. He gently placed Horny onto the table. The rabbit stirred, but settled back down after a few good stokes through its fur.

Roland froze as Rose pulled out a small ball-peen hammer and a sharp razor-edged knife.

“No—” he breathed.

“Now you'll want to hit here.” She touched the bunny on the back of its head, causing it to twitch.

“Please—”

“You will need to hit hard, or you'll just cause it a lot of pain.”

She tried to hand him the hammer but he backed up and fell off the stool.

“_Roland._”

Her tone had become dangerous. He beat his mind against the walls that surrounded him, closed walls that collapsed into claustrophobia. He looked around desperately for Master Yeng but there was no one around, nowhere to turn, no one to turn to. And he was the one to bring his only friend to the slaughter.

He reached for his friend, but Rose had placed a hand on the bunny with a light touch of iron. Nothing would break that hold.

“Please don't kill Horny.”

She let out a sad sigh and shook her head. “Never name your kills.”

“No—”

“_Yes_. This is your hunt, your kill.”

He scooted back but only pressed himself against an invisible wall. She'd closed him in.

He stood and trembled as she raised the hammer up again to him in an offering.

He took the hammer; he had no choice.

It was a heavy, hateful thing. His heart raced, and his palms sweat. It drug him down as he stepped back up on the stool.

Horny slept. It had been a long day, eventful with so much rooting and play, so many new things, with strange flying boys and delicious food hidden just below the feet. A good day.

He lifted the hammer, but he couldn't see anymore. Horny had become little more than twisted mass as the tears filled his eyes. It was too much, and the hammer too heavy. It fell out of his hand and hit the ground with a distant thud. He shuddered and buried his head.

Yet the hammer found its way back to him. It slipped into his hand, uninvited, and he felt cold, iron fingers wrap around that hand.

“This is who you are.” Her tone was kind, and the cruel words slipped in between the cracks of him to bury deep inside.

She raised his hand, hammer in hand, and brought it down quickly on Horny's head. Bone cracked with a crunch; it was a soft, wet sound. Horny twitched and went still.

Roland cried out, dropped the hammer, and curled up into himself. Gasping sobs broke out through rapid, broken breaths. His hands clenched as he struggled, and his body shook. He felt ashamed and angry, hating Rose more than anything else in the world.

He felt a hand on his shoulder as he buried his face deeper into himself.

“Death is part of life,” she whispered, “You must accept it as you do life. To fight it will only bring pain and torment.”

She let him weep, her hand on his shoulder as his muscles clenched and fought themselves. He hated that hand, for the comfort it brought, the weight of it, the way it corrupted his grief. He wanted to rage, to scream, to rip her apart, but her hand was so heavy, so implacable. All he had left was to rage against himself, and so he did.

He was tired and wrung out when his sobs faded. All he wanted to do was crawl into his bed, drift away, and forget the day ever happened.

But she wasn't done.

She reached under and with that same cold iron, pulled his face up to meet hers. Her face was calm and dispassionate, ever the rock against which he beat himself.

Into his hand slipped a new tool. Its edge glinted red in the fading light. He stood to follow his hand as she guided it back to the carcass before them. She made a small incision near the back of its head and carefully worked it back down to the tail. She flipped it over. She then started near the middle-back and he cut a new incision around the belly. From there, it was a simple matter for him to pull away the hide, and with it the tail. The head came off next, though for that he used a larger knife. After that went the feet, and then the belly and the removal of organs, some of them set aside, others put with the hide. Usable meat was filleted and set aside.

It was over in mere minutes, in the space required to hollow a soul.

His face was empty, and his eyes dead when she charged him to bury the unusable remains. Too much of it was unusable, worthless, little more than bloody flesh to be buried. He took a basket, carefully put what remained of the creature in it, grabbed a shovel, and walked out into the fading light to bury his last friend in life.

It took a long time to fall asleep that night as he stared into a black room with dark thoughts. He couldn't know what he lost that day; he couldn't understand what had been done. He knew only that his heart had been hollowed out, and deep within it, seeds began to grow.
