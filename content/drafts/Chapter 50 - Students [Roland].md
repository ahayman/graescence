# 50 | Students [Roland]

Roland stepped into the courtyard and paused, one hand on the door, his other arm half way through wiping the crumbs from lunch off his face with his sleeve.

There were children in the courtyard? He blinked twice, then realized they were all probably older than him. Three of them stood off center of the courtyard, closer to the barracks. Two of them stood together, leaving the third apart. The pair had ebony skin, though the girl's was a bit lighter than than the boy's, who's tone approached midnight.

Roland had never been one to notice clothing much, but all of them wore such expensive and foreign attire that he couldn't help but stare. The boy had a dark green, felt coat over an equally deep purple, double breasted vest secured by twin columns of dark red-dyed wooden buttons. The buttons almost perfectly matched the color of his pants, which had a kind of velvet shimmer he'd never seen before. The colors should have clashed except they were so close to shades of black than any true color. He also wore a black felt top hat cocked off center which, perhaps, he thought was stylish?

The girl's cloths bore such matching colors to the boy's that Roland concluded they were family, possibly siblings. Her coat was made of a rigid green material, low cut, buttoned tight around her torso, with wide lapels. The coat split just above her waist, wrapped around her hips, and flared out into a kind of half dress that descended to the back of her knees. Under it was soft felt, a black purple shirt. She had virtually the same slick pants of her brother, though a tighter fit highlighting muscular legs.

The boy standing apart had a calm stature, arms folded loosely behind him. He had the same complexion and features as Master Yeng, with dark narrow eyes, sharp cheek bones, and a smaller nose on a flat face. He wore a similar light gray robe to what Master Yeng had wore the day he'd arrived. It had been left open and it shifted about at the light breeze, making Roland wonder just how effective it was at keeping out the cold. Underneath, his shirt was a darker gray, though on second glance, calling it a shirt was a mistake. It had sleeves, but from the shoulders they turned into a kind of wrap that crisscrossed down the boy's torso all the way down to his pants, which were made of an even darker grey fabric cut loose about his legs.

Roland's attention, though was dominated by the duo's clothing, which were nothing short of absurd and impractical to him. And yet, the single thought dominating his mind was not for the clothing but for Sal, whom would have salivated at such attire. His pang of loss, though, was speared through by the elder boy's voice.

"...recognize the peaks," the ebony boy said in a lilting accent with clipped words.

The girl shook her head slowly while the boy turned and gestured at the library.

"And a library? Is that a library? I think it is. Why would a martial school need a library?"

The girl said nothing, though her lips pressed into a suppressed smile.

The boy turned to the one standing apart and pointed at him. "You. Yen, Yan, Wan... Wang?"

The other boy's calm face somehow flattened even more. "Ashter."

"Ah yes, Wan. You come from merchants, yes? You must travel—"

"We do not."

"—and so surely you can tell where we are?"

Ashter took a deep breath through his nose and let it out slowly. "I don't know."

The ebony boy turned to the girl and his eyes lit up. "My dear sis, I believe we've been deceived. This is not a martial school but a prison and we've been kidnapped for ransom."

The girl rolled her eyes. "A premature supposition—"

"No! Think about it. A silver haired barb— oof."

He flinched over as the girl backhanded his solar plexus. He took a second to recover his breath, straightened himself, then his coat, and continued as though nothing had happened.

"A _beautiful_ silver haired pale woman of clearly mountainous descent has taken us to a supposed Martial Arts school deep in the— no!" he raised a finger, "now wait for it," he spread his arms out in a shallow, mock bow, "—the _mountains_."

His sister looked thoroughly unimpressed, though she dipped her head ever so slightly. "I will admit it is _an_ explanation."

"The only explanation! Look, there are but three buildings and no," he swept his arm until his eyes stopped on Roland, "...students?"

The others turned while the boy looked Roland up and down twice, very much like he was evaluating property. His eyes lit up.

"A servant!" He tilted his head back and breathed out, "oh thank the forgotten gods. I... I thought it was just us," he said with exaggerated relief and turned his eyes back to Roland. "You, servant boy. Where are we precisely? And exactly how much is the ransom? Because I assure you, if you would work with me, I can get you much more than you can otherwise," he paused for effect, "for a price, of course, but you will certainly reap more than without and we can both walk away from this well compensated; I know my parents quite well you see, and with just a little theatrics and— _what am I saying_? Never mind all that. You're a servant; of course you wouldn't know. Where is your master? I need to speak with her — him? no, definitely her — as soon as can be arran— will you _stop_ that!"

He smacked away his sister's hand, who'd been tugging at his sleeve. She barely noticed, her eyes wide and fixed to Master Yeng, who walked out and stood before them. Ashter bowed low from the waist, and the girl followed him moments later. The boy, though, had simply cocked his head in a confused frown as though he were trying to remember something forgotten.

"Ven!" his sister whispered furiously, "bow you fool!"

"Bow? Me? Why would I—"

"That's Master Yeng!"

Ven looked at Master Yeng in confusion as Roland stepped between the girl and Ashter, and then bowed. He risked a glance over in time to see Ven jerk himself in half, spilling his hat on the ground. The boy appeared to be struggling with disbelief.

Roland straightened after a couple seconds, leaving the others curiously still bent over. Master Yeng spared him a quick glance, his lips pressed in amusement, but it was gone a moment later. He folded his arms behind him just as the others rose from their bow

"As you know, each of you have been chosen to participate the Martial Exchange. It is a singular opportunity for the best of each school to learn from other schools techniques and styles foreign to you. However," he drew the word out and fixed his eyes on Ven, who snapped to attention from his attempt to look around his sister at Roland, "you may have noticed, this is no ordinary school. Here there are few students and only one teacher."

"Forgive me, master?" the girl said.

"Terraria va Belcia." Master Yeng dipped his head. "Speak."

"Oh, just Terra please. I thought you had retired."

"I did, and I used it to take advantage of other opportunities."

"But..." she trailed off with a confused frown.

"Speak your mind, young lady. Here you will deliver no offense with honesty."

Her shoulders relaxed but her frown deepened. She took a few seconds, seeming to gather her thoughts. "You are famous. You created the Sutan Arts Academy and made it one of the best schools in the Empire, a school most Royals would kill to gain entrance to. Why would you abandon that?"

He smiled at her and shrugged, but Roland thought there was a tightness in his eyes.

"There comes a time, Miss Belcia, when your children will no longer need you, and the best you can do for them is to walk away and let them stand on their own."

"Oh... of course." The frown never left her face.

"So does that mean you will teach us personally?" Ven asked.

"It does, and you will use each other to sharpen your skills."

"Oh that's just delightful, and we even have a servant boy to fetch us water. Truly, I think I will like it here."

"Roland is just as much a student as you are, Vendor van Belcia."

Ven scoffed. "Him? Isn't he a tad young?"

Roland couldn't help but agree. If he had to guess, they were each at least fifteen years old, though his stature made him about their equal in size.

"Which itself should give you pause, dear brother." The patronizing undertones of Ven's sister was hard to miss.

Ven looked askance at Roland, then shrugged. "If you say so."

"Today will not be a day for teaching, but for discovery," Master Yeng said, ignoring the two. "Over the next hour or so, you each will pair off against each other in unarmed combat. The one to hit the ground looses."

Ven plastered a smile on his face. "Oh how delightful—"

"I would warn against any conclusions drawn from these matches," Master Yeng raised a hand. "You each have unique talents untested by foreign techniques, and a win could easily be attributed to luck as much as skill."

Both Ashter and Terraria gave Master Yeng a half bow, as did Roland, although only once the other two were already half-bent over. Ven's attempt at a bow was to jerk his head and one shoulder, his lips twisted in sarcastic smile.

"Vendor, you will take the first match with Roland."

Roland jerked his head to Master Yeng, though the man refused to meet his gaze. No matter his size, Roland was still three years junior to the other boy, who had certainly trained long before even Roland's age.

"Yes I will," Ven dipped his head graciously, and with as much sarcasm as he could imbue the gesture, "but at least it is destined to be short."

Roland moved into the approximate center while the others moved to stand by Master Yeng. Ven snatched his hat off the ground and walked away. It took Roland a second to realize Ven wasn't forfeiting, but simply shedding his coat onto one of the benches. Beneath it was a white shirt embroidered with elaborate flowers that looked more like something his mother would have worn than... well, than any man or boy Roland could think of. He stared at it with a quizzical expression.

"Oh have no fear my servant boy," Ven said on noticing Roland gaze, "you shan't have any opportunity to bespoil this beauty." He plucked the sleeve.

Roland couldn't help it; he barked out a laugh. Ven smiled in return, but there was an edge to it, not that Roland much cared. It felt like a joke. He was getting ready to fight a boy in a embroidered shirt and he was pretty sure he was going to loose, badly.

"Tell me, servant boy," Ven said as he approached, "just how you managed such rarefied company?"

Roland frowned as Ven settled a few paces before him. He didn't look as though he were ready for a fight. If anything, he looked relaxed, as though he were ready to do anything but fight. Something about it set Roland on edge.

"Because truly I cannot understand how your parents could afford training, yet offer you nothing in the way of attire."

"Ven," Terraria said in a tired, drawn out tone, "perhaps you could pretend civility."

It was his balance; it was perfect. He stood nonchalant, but his weight was even, his knees unlocked, his feet apart just far enough to shift easily in any direction but not so far as to ruin the illusion of disinterest. It was, Roland concluded, a stance designed to misdirect, an invitation to underestimate. He was pretty sure the boy's words were equally intended as a distraction.

"My parents are dead," he replied, hoping to throw the boy off balance.

"Are they now? Oh, how tragic," Ven said, his tone suggesting otherwise. His eyes lit up. "Oh! Were they treasure hunters? Did they find a relic? That's it, isn't it? And they left you bereft of love, yet with a priceless relic you used to gain entrance to a martial school but not, it appears, any sense of style."

"Ven!" Terraria snapped out her brother's name like a curse, and the whip-like tone drew Roland's eyes to her.

In that moment, Ven stepped forward and launched his fist at Roland.

It would have worked had he truly been distracted. Instead, Roland stepped in toward the attack, shifting himself just out the way and, in imitation of Master Yeng, reached to grab Ven's arm and pull him off balance. He missed as Ven retracted his arm far quicker than Roland expected and turned his momentum into a pirouette that placed him facing Roland's back. Recognizing the danger, Roland lunged away from the boy, pretty sure he'd narrowly avoided getting punched in the back of the head. He turned around to see Ven back in that same disinterested stance. The boy had cocked his head, as though studying an aberration.

"Huh," Ven said.

Roland blinked, then suppressed a smile as he stepped toward Ven. "I think that might the most intelligent thing I've heard you say."

"Oh dear." Terraria lifted her hand to her mouth.

Ven's eyes widened a fraction, but he recovered quickly. "I had no idea you knew so many words! Truly a delight to see, I say, like a monkey that talks."

Roland snapped his fist out as feint, then again with intent to hit. It was not elegant, closer to the brawls he'd been accustomed to growing up. But his training with Master Yeng was still early and most of what he'd learned was defensive in nature so far.

Ven didn't even bother to flinch at the feint, and the punch he simply slapped away, leaving Roland off balance. Ven stepped in and pushed Roland, tripping him over Ven's foot and sprawling him out onto the courtyard stone.

Roland stood up and brushed himself off, replaying the fight in his mind. He hadn't expected the hit to land, but he had expected a dodge or perhaps a grab like Master Yeng would often do.

"Vendor van Belcia and Ashter Wan," Master Yeng called out.

Ashter shrugged off his robe, folded it, and placed it on the bench before squaring off with Ven.

Ven opened his mouth, likely to say something sarcastic, but Ashter closed quickly, forcing him back with a series of light jabs. Ven danced out of the way, working to keep distance between them. Within a few moments, though, Ashter had broken through and the fight shifted into a series of grabs and counters before Ashter's elbow took Ven in the temple.

Roland didn't bother to hide his smile when he saw the boy's beautiful needlework bespoiled by courtyard dust.

"Ashter Wan and Terraria va Belcia."

After seeing Ashter, Roland pretty much marked the round for him, and yet again his expectations were found lacking. Terra used a similar style to her brother, but where he pranced around his opponent, Terra seemed to flow with a grace Roland doubted her brother could ever match. Her powerful legs gave her speed, and it wasn't long before Ashter found himself misplaced and at her whim.

The next match pitted her against Roland, and that went about as well as expected. Like her brother, she had this way of predicting where Roland would be and using that to place herself in the worst possible place. Twice he basically ran away, if only to reset his position to her. After a few minutes, he got tired of all the dancing around and threw a punch. It resulted in him rolling off her hip, flipping through the air, and landing on his back with his arm painfully twisted while his hand was pinned in place by three of her fingers. No matter how he replayed it, he couldn't figure out what she'd done.

The next match was between her and her brother, which also went as expected, although Roland was delighted by the details. Her brother, it seemed, simply couldn't resist prancing around his opponent, and her sister was having none of it. At just the right time, she twisted her hips and snapped out a painful kick against Ven's leg as he was basically twirling around her. Roland almost shouted victory.

Having won all her matches, she stepped aside to allow Roland and Ashter their match, the final one. Roland stepped into the makeshift ring and watched Ashter, wary. At this point, he'd concluded that everyone here far outclassed him, but he he'd also realized just how vulnerable he was when he attacked. He had no illusions about winning, but he would not allow himself to be drawn into such an obvious mistake again.

In both his prior matches, Ashter proved to be aggressive from the start. His strength was in closing to grappling range, which favored him. So Roland took a play from Ven and kept his distance, jumping — not prancing — to keep himself out of range while studying Ashter as closely as possible. He ignored all of Ashter's attacks, even when they landed painfully or drew blood. If there was one thing Roland could do well, it was to take a hit, and by focusing on the man he hoped to learn enough to turn the tide.

After a couple minutes of this, Ashter stepped well out of range and eyed Roland.

"You have learned wisdom."

Unsure of how to respond to that, Roland simply shrugged and stepped back up to engage.

The next few minutes were a blur. Roland took multiple hits, earning himself bruises and a bloody nose while allowing Ashter no room to close in. He also began to recognize a pattern in his opponent's behavior and when the time came, a small shift of feet signalled an attack Roland thought he could take advantage of.

Ashter fist snapped out, cracking into Roland's nose.

At the same time, Roland was already reaching for his arm as it retracted. He _pushed_ just a little, throwing Ashter off balance, and stepped forward, placing his foot behind Ashter's. Ashter tripped and landed hard on rear.

Roland stepped up and offered the astonished boy his hand.

Ashter looked at Roland, then his hand, and a considered expression flittered across his face. He took his hand and allowed Roland to pull him to his feet. He looked Roland in the eyes, then dipped his head.

"What did you learn from this?"

Roland turned to Master Yeng, who was looking at Ven. Ven rolled his eyes.

"I supposed I might remain a bit more grounded," he said.

Roland couldn't help prodding him. "You mean you don't want to prance all around the field?"

Ven somehow managed to level a polite glare a him, something Roland wasn't sure he'd ever seen before.

"As I said," the boy said in bored tone and turned away, all the while plucking lint or dirt or nothing from the front of his shirt. Did he even realize his back was still dirty? Roland wasn't sure.

Master Yeng turned to Ashter and raised a brow. Ashter took a second, looked over at Roland, then back at Master Yeng.

"To win the war, we must sometimes loose a battle... or, in this case, take a blow." He gave Roland a small nod.

Master Yeng turned to Terraria. "Miss Belcia?"

She had her eyes glued to Roland in a way that made him uncomfortable, like she was trying to solve a half-formed puzzle.

"This one learns far too quickly."

Roland averted his eyes, unsure of what exactly she was looking for. For the first time in his life, he really did feel like a dirty peasant. Doubt crept in as the silence stretched.

After a time, "hmmm," was all Master Yeng managed. He turned to Roland and raised a brow.

Roland took a deep breath and held it while he thought. He released it after a moment and said, "My expectations leave me off balance."

Master Yeng's brow shot up, and suddenly Roland realized this was exactly the lesson the man had been attempting to teach him since they started. Roland felt his cheeks flush.

"It seems in less than an hour, each of you has already learned an important lesson. We will continue this for the rest of the day and perhaps we shall again learn something new."

Master Yeng paired them off for sparring, Roland to Ven and Terraria to Ashter. After half an hour, he would switch them up. On and on they sparred, and not once did Roland ever win.

Yet it didn't bother him. It took him a long time to realize why.

Rose and Master Yeng had been so far beyond him that to even hope for win was the definition of absurdity. Yet with these students, Roland _could_ hope. He could see it. It would take hard work and he would bleed a lot, but he could _see_ himself winning.

By the time the sun cast it's fading orange spears for the day, Roland was exhausted, bruised, and... hopeful. It was a foreign emotion, something he'd thought long since buried. But there it was, suddenly spilling over the darkness of his soul, spreading light where none should rightfully exist.

At the end, the others left for the barracks, leaving Roland to watch them walk away, alone again. Before he could turn, he felt a hand squeeze his shoulder. He looked over to Master Yeng, who's gaze held him in its intensity.

"She will ever try to break you," he said in a quiet whisper, "but I would not see that happen."

He abruptly let go Roland's shoulder, turned, and followed the students into the barracks.
