# 12 | Aggression [Stan]

Stan felt ice in his veins as he rushed toward Min. He made it two steps before someone grabbed his arm and spun him around.

"Now now, there'll be plenty of her to go—"

Stan reached over to pry the man's hand from his arm. Instead, crystal sheared through the man's forearm, sending half of it to the floor along with the hand.

Both Stan and his would-be interloper stared at the appendage, incomprehension mirrored on their faces. The room stilled as everyone looked at the hand and the pool of blood growing beside it.

"My...my hand?"

The man bent over, presumably to pick up his hand, but he only made it halfway before letting out a small moan and toppling over as the shift in blood pressure drove him into unconsciousness. Blood continued to rhythmically pulse, dumping lifeblood on the floor quicker than Stan ever thought possible.

"_Shaper! Rush him!_" the Matron screamed.

Stan flinched, only now noticing the shards of barely-visible crystal formed around his hands. He dismissed them in horror as his mind caught up to what he'd done and the dying man on the floor.

"No no no," he whispered, "not again."

"_Rush him, fools, before he kills us all!_"

Her voice finally drew the room out of shock. Stan instinctually threw up a half dome of crystal between him and the first of the room to heed her. Three of them impacted his shield at once, sending him flying back. He hit the floor hard and rolled into Min's legs. She jerked, blurry eyes fluttering open.

"Wha..." Her eyes widened at the sight of Stan on the floor. "_Stan!_"

She jerked against her restraints as the men quickly recovered and joined the rest to launch themselves toward the pair. Stan simply raised another shield, this time making sure to embed spikes of it into the floor, walls, and ceiling. He normally avoided causing damage like this with his crystal, but the habit had backfired and he was well beyond caring.

He winced as they threw themselves at the shield repeatedly, then frowned as the floorboards splintered. He sent more spikes through the floor and into the ground beneath until he was satisfied it wouldn't give.

"Get me out of this," Min's voice snarled from behind him.

He pushed himself up and immediately began pulling at the knots, trying hard to keep his eyes averted from her exposed flesh. His fingers were sweating and shaking, slipping off the knot.

"Crystal, Stan, use your Crystal."

He blinked. "Oh, right."

Even anchored, the pummeling of his shield pushed at him, keeping him off balance. Not trusting his precision, he cut the bulk of each knot and pulled apart what remained.

Min jumped up and tried to cover herself up, but the way the clothes had been cut made it difficult. Spotting their cloaks piled into the corner, Stan grabbed one and wrapped it around her, earning a grateful look.

"What are they doing?" she said in exasperation. They'd organized into three sets, staggering their attacks to give themselves rest without giving Stan any at all. It spoke of unusually extensive experience with shapers.

"Trying to wear me down. They think I can only form a single shape, and so they're attacking my shield to prevent me from..."

"Killing them?"

"...yeah."

"So, kill them," she said through clenched teeth.

"_No,_" he snarled at her, but at her hurt expression, he softened. "No, I don't—just no. I don't want to kill."

"A little late for that, I think."

Min shifted her gaze off Stan to something on the floor. He refused to follow it, turning his gaze opposite hers. He knew exactly what she was looking at.

He squeezed his eyes shut. "I know, but..." His whole body shuddered, breath shallow. He'd killed, again. He promised himself he would never do it, and yet...

A warm hand wormed into his and squeezed.

"I'm...sorry," she said. "They hurt me and—"

"No no, I know. I just—"

"Do what you need to do. I...trust you."

He looked up, startled at the conviction in her voice. But in her eyes, he saw it, that moment, eyes closed, tilting into the fall, trusting her partner to catch her. He met that gaze with conviction and nodded.

Turning back to the tide of assaults, he saw exhaustion and fear. The Matron screamed, her desperation muffled by the crystal between them. They'd clearly fought shapers before, but they'd never fought him.

Looking the Matron in the eyes, he raised his arm, palms up, and formed balls of crystal over them, almost leisurely, showing no effort at all. First one, then three, then six took shape, glittering rainbow in the faint light until almost disappearing altogether. Her eyes widened in horror as they raced, flickering _through_ his shield to strike the current wave attacking them. It was a trick, opening holes in his shield to let them through, but one that perhaps no one else in the world was capable of.

All six men dropped to the floor, unconscious.

Stan calmly formed another six balls. The staggered attack hesitated, uncertain, and Stan never gave them a chance to recover. He sent the balls out and the second stage of assaults dropped to the floor.

The remaining six began to back up, casting glances at the exit. The Matron looked ready to bolt, so he formed a shield over the exit, blocking them from fleeing.

He allowed the shield protecting him to dissolve. It was useless now that their attack had faltered. Instead, he spun eight balls of crystal around him, one for every other person in the room aside from him and Min.

"All we wanted was supplies," he said in a matter-of-fact tone. "_Supplies._" He shook his head. "I have no idea what feud you're embroiled in, but all we wanted was supplies."

The Matron did not look like she believed him. With a flick of his wrist, he sent seven balls careening toward the last of her support. They dropped to the floor, puppets whose strings had been suddenly cut.

Stan sighed, hoping they weren't dead. He wasn't sure he could bear any more of that weight on his conscious.

With the last of her support laying unconscious on the floor, the Matron seemed to deflate. She backed slowly from their approach until her back hit the wall, shoulders slumped. On them, Stan could see the endless weight of a losing war. He felt no guilt, no pity for her. But for a moment he understood a person forced to make unfortunate choices that led them to become...this thing.

"Listen, I'm sorry but—"

A hand appeared from out of nowhere to slap the Matron hard enough to send her spinning.

"You _bitch_," Min snarled, stalking the Matron with a ferocity that shocked Stan so much that his last ball of crystal dissolved. Not that it mattered. He'd been intimidating an old woman at this point, and it didn't feel good at all.

Stan opened his mouth to object, but Min beat him.

"Hold no pity for that thing," she turned on him. "She'd laugh while I was raped."

Stan slowly closed his mouth. Min turned back to the Matron and then kicked her into the wall. Stan's mouth dropped as the Matron slumped to the floor.

Min bent over the old woman and snarled, "Supplies."

The woman gestured to a door opposite them, her breath shallow and broken. He wasn't sure how to feel about that, but when Min raised her foot again, Stan pushed her away before she could kill a vulnerable old woman, no matter how vile she may be.

"Fine," Min growled and stalked toward the door the Matron had pointed out.

Stan turned back to the Matron, but the woman's eyes were unfocused on the scene behind him. Stan winced, wishing he could fix this...whatever this was. He tried to think of words to say, something that would make all this better, but he might as well divert a river with a spoon than convince this broken woman before him of...anything, anything at all.

After a few minutes of awkward silence, Min emerged from the door dressed in very hardy, thick clothes. She did not look pleased, but then she was fully covered in forest colors with clothes designed for...well, the forest. A large sack cross-draped her body, bulging as though she'd haphazardly thrown in everything she could get her hands on. She stumbled from the weight.

"Do you want me—"

"Come on," she said as she stalked by them, almost walking on pant legs too long for her. She stopped by the door, then turned and gave Stan an expectant look.

"Oh, right."

He let the Crystal he'd formed over the door unravel and turned to follow her. He stopped for a moment, looking back at the Matron, but the woman seemed engrossed in her own world, dissolving around her, eyes still locked on all the unconscious men on the floor.

Stan shook off the scene and followed Min out of the house.

---

The rain had not let up. If anything, it had gotten worse. Yet while Stan kept a formed umbrella of Crystal above him large enough to cover the both of them, Min stomped on, insistent on staying beyond him, soaking in the rain. He could see her body shiver, yet every time he tried to form crystal above her, she'd intentionally walk out of his range.

He had no idea what to do.

So he followed as she led in no direction in particular, just away. Perhaps that's all she needed. Perhaps she needed the rain.

Perhaps he did.

There was something very wrong with what happened. His mind replayed the details over and over until a knot of anxiety threatened to eat him from the inside out. He was half tempted to dissolve his crystal umbrella in a misguided effort to let the rain wash it away.

Kill them, she'd said. He couldn't. He _did_, but he couldn't. Even the one who died, accident though it was, weighed like a millstone of dread on his soul.

It wasn't that they deserved to live. What they intended to do, and that a Matron herself would orchestrate it...his disgust threatened to overwhelm even his anxiety. Their entire society was built around the wisdom of the Matrons. The wrongness of those people ate at him. If anyone deserved to die, it's them.

He just...just couldn't be the one to do it. He couldn't become that monster, the thing everyone hated. The thing he feared he already was.

It took several hours before she calmed, and even then he could tell her rage simmered beneath the surface, waiting to explode. It was still early, but he didn't question it when she stopped in a small clearing and sat on a small stump.

He formed a canopy of Crystal over the small clearing, and then, in a moment of inspiration, cordoned off the clearing with a small wall of Crystal to divert the water around it. He'd learned his lesson—they'd sleep dry tonight.

Or...dry-ish. The ground was pretty soaked.

He then sent out more Cyrstal to gather as much wood as possible, roaming the edges and pulling in whatever wood caught his eye. Once he gathered enough, he pulled it into a pile and speared a yellow shard of Glass into the wood until it burned. A crystal flue formed over the fire to draw the smoke up through a hole in the umbrella and around a small cap he forced to keep the rain out.

Min scooted closer to the fire, hands spread toward the warmth while she shivered, clothes soaked. Stan sat down next to her, not too close, but still close. He felt uncertain, scared, angry...yet he was certain his emotions were nothing to what she felt. Her lips occasionally twitched into a snarl, as though she were moments from exploding into a rage.

Dusk darkened the gray sky into black so deep only the light of the fire held it back. Neither spoke, each lost in their internal wars.

Finally, Min broke the silence. Her voice rasped and cracked.

"That...that _bitch_ violates everything, _everything_ good about the Mother. Every precept, everything the Matron is supposed to stand for, she twisted into...into..."

"She was no true Matron."

"She was no Matron at all," she barked out. "She...she..."

Stan slowly reach out, hesitant, until Min snatched his hand and squeezed until it hurt. He moved in and drew her into an embrace.

Tears came first, pouring out from her like an unwanted fountain of pain amidst shudders of pain. Then she screamed, over and over, into his chest as he held her, her hands clawed into fists of his cloak. His tears silently fell into her damp hair as she trembled.

She never spoke again that night. She only screamed a muffled rage until her throat grew hoarse. He wove his fingers through her hair, over and over until the trembling subsided and exhaustion pulled her into oblivion.

He pulled her close, leaned back against the stump, and stared at the fire. It took hours for sleep to take him, and when it did, he dreamt only of a beast slaughtering the innocent.
