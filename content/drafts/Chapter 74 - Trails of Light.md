# 74 | Trails of Light

Roland _pulled_ and laughed, soared in freedom through a forest that was bare from winter’s embrace, clothed in nothing, and spotted in patches of blood-red. The icy wind tore his hair back, froze his tears, and sent tendrils of frost to probe every possible gap in his clothes.

He shivered and smiled, _pulled_ harder to welcome her majesty’s glacial breath, let her chill his bones, and quench the fire that burned his veins, let it eat away the simmering rage and still every silent shout. He welcomed the ice into him, for all that was frozen had forgotten pain.

He was free, and all the world was bright. He felt invincible, untouchable, so far above the dirt and mud of below. This high nothing could touch him.

It was a lie, of course.

Plenty of things could kill him and easily at that. He headed toward the most dangerous area he knew, where monsters he’d never dreamed of could kill him with barely a thought.

He didn’t care. He was free, and this was the closest thing to happiness he knew.

The forest stole time with a blur of reds, browns, and whites that bled into a blue sky scarcely streaked with distant, striated ice. He lost himself in the endless moments of flight and allowed his mind to rest as the passing trees worked to release some of the tension that had built within him.

Navigation through the trees had become instinctual, as did the dozen or so anchors he used to propel himself through the forest. At the same time, it gave his mind something to do, much like he might during his meditation. It was freedom coupled with a release of the pressure that had built from the training since his last hunt.

But the last hunt had been too soon, and instead of bleeding off pressure, he found himself simply enjoying the mindless flight through the bled colors of winter.

Then it was wrong. The colors had shifted, and instead of white running into the sky, it was red and black that sent tendrils into a pale crystal blue.

He slowed himself to a stop to look around and blinked slowly in wonder.

He was surrounded by Whitewoods and _only_ Whitewoods. He lowered himself to the ground to study the scene. At some point, they must have choked out the regular fauna, leaving not even the detritus of autumn on the floor, only hard-packed dirt oddly formed from thick interwoven roots. It was not a ground for walking, and though he spotted tracks here and there, they seemed to meander rather than converge on any real trail. Even odder, there was no snow, except for an occasional patch that appeared to have fallen in clumps.

He looked around at the trunks and felt a sense of wonder and unease. They were dozens of paces wide and stretched hundreds of paces into the air, larger even than the behemoths he’d become accustomed to. He stood in a silent world with impossible pillars of white that appeared to hold up the sky itself, a white, crystalline sky, streaked with red and black.

It was as if he’d walked uninvited into some god’s throne room or perhaps another world altogether.

Unease and fear warred with wonder and curiosity, which eventually won out. He _pulled_ on those same pillars to raise himself higher and take in more of the view. It was simply too beautiful for him to ignore. In every direction he looked, the pillars consumed the forest until they became the horizon itself. No matter how high he rose, he could not discern an end.

Then he reached the sky.

The sky was a brilliant white encasing a deep azure, tinged with red, and streaked through with branching darkness. It hurt to look at, yet that light was insufficient to fill the forest where the pillars now seemed to rise from darkness itself. The branches of the Whitewoods had interwoven themselves into the strange firmament where they disappeared as little more than a dark web, as though they’d been consumed by the sky even as they held it up. He reached up to touch it, and the cold white fell onto his face.

He laughed. It was snow.

His mind twisted around the revelation to reframe what he was really looking at. The branches had formed such a dense, impermeable, interwoven canopy that the snow simply rested on their limbs and leaves until the elements hardened it all into this crystalline sky. Never would he have believed his forest held such ethereal beauty. Never in his dreams had he imagined such a thing even possible.

Did it really do this every winter?

He felt the urge to abandon his hunt and simply explore what he could of the forest to see what other miracles he might find. But then, that was a quick way to an early death, for these miracles were guarded treasures and perhaps for a good reason. Even a single one of these white pillars represented enough wealth to buy a castle, if not a small province. He literally floated within an Empire’s wealth of gravwood. At that moment, he was the richest man in the world.

He suddenly felt grateful for all the beasts that guarded such treasures, for without them, the forest would have been felled long ago. Beauty had married itself to death that it might survive.

It felt sacred.

A flash of white twisted his head about. His eyes darted to find nothing. Everything was still, silent, but now it was pregnant with expectation, and his heart picked up its pace in response.

He _pulled_ hard in the direction he thought the mountains were, but it was impossible to tell when every direction looked the same. Even the sun’s position had been obscured through the diffusion of so much snow.

Another flash to his left, and he instinctually dodged right as his eyes sought his pursuer. A compression of air tore at his attention, and he shifted to see that he had whipped by a tree by less than a hand’s width. His lapse of attention had brought him perilously close to death, and he determined to keep his attention forward. No matter what kind of beast pursued him, a simple error in flight would serve him a quicker death.

After a few minutes, he began to wonder if he’d simply imagined it all. The Whitewoods blurred past him, but he saw nothing else.

He shook off the foolish thought. If you thought you were being pursued, you most certainly were. Hell, even if you didn’t think you were being pursued, you still probably were.

On a hunch, he expanded his senses to find anything around and gasped at the massive thing behind him. He couldn’t afford to turn around, but whatever it was matched his pace.

He dove for the ground, and it matched him. He wove through the trees, choosing directions randomly, and still, it matched him. He corked himself around a tree before flinging himself in yet another random direction. It followed his maneuver but around a different tree... how odd.

On a hunch or perhaps a moment of insanity, he dove for the creature. It twisted itself about and replaced where he’d been but a moment before, their positions now mirrored.

He shifted up, and it went down. He went left, it went right. He curved around a tree, and it curved around another in a mirrored maneuver. He spiraled, and it spiraled opposite of him.

A giggle of delight escaped his lips. He’d never flown with anyone before. He’d never danced in the air with a partner.

He let out a whoop and a laugh, then he _pulled_ hard and twisted himself through the trees. He moved foolishly, risking harm for the sheer delight that came from the dance. He whipped himself around trees, dove and rose, twisted and turned. They became little more than a blur as instinct alone guided. He dodged and banked, changed directions often, and guided them both, he and his monster, in a dance of ever-increasing complexity.

Still, it kept his pace and mirrored his motion in a deadly, beautiful dance.

He slowed and then climbed to the sky until he was skimming its very surface. On impulse, he reached up and trailed his fingers lightly in the snow. He finally looked over, but he already knew what he would see. At some point, the dance had felt familiar, as did this presence with which he'd entangled himself.

In a rare display, the Wyrm unfurled its wings and brought them up to lightly trail the snow above in mimicry. And so they both left trails of glittering light falling slowly into the darkness below.

And then it was gone, and the full brightness of the sun blinded him.

He stopped fully and turned back to stare. His eyes watered from the sudden brightness, forcing him to wipe them twice before he could see the darkened forest. And it _was_ dark. From here, he could see nothing inside. From here, it looked like nothing special, perhaps even ominous. He marveled how brilliantly beauty had disguised itself, and if that were not enough, it had a protector.

The Wyrm, and he had found its home.

Over the years, he would occasionally see glimpses of the beast, hidden in the forest yet content to only watch. He’d never encountered a predator so willing to wait so long. It watched him, always on the periphery, only to vanish at first notice. Glimpsing the beast became almost expected, and he found himself surprised when the occasional hunt yielded no view of the beast at all, surprised and sad. And alarmed, for he was never sure if it hadn’t followed him, or else he had missed it. Yet it felt like a companion sometimes, and he had few enough of those.

He wished Ellie was there to see it, how they had danced. It might not change her opinion of it, stubborn as she could be. She seemed unnerved by the Wyrm’s behavior and frequently cursed it whenever she saw it, calling it a creepy stalker. She should have seen how they danced.

A pang of loneliness shot through him. He wished she was here, but this was not a normal part of his hunting grounds and she was ever more cross with him of late. He doubted she would find him.

He spared one final, regretful glance at the forest and then launched himself toward the mountains.
