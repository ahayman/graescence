# 69 | Blind

“Can you see yet?”

Roland peered into what appeared as little more than a dark hole in the ground, more a crack, really. He’d have to squeeze himself through the hole to make it through and then who knows what he’d find. Would he even be able to get out?

He glanced up at the surrounding Whitewoods and squinted against the light filtering through the green canopy. At least there were plenty of Whitewoods nearby to anchor to, which should make climbing easier. A light breeze tickled the leaves and flashed the sun in his eyes. It would be a nice day for a hunt if only he could remain above ground.

He turned to Ellie. “Are you sure it’s down there?”

“Doesn’t matter if you can’t actually see, now does it? So?”

He turned back to the hole. The cave entrance was small, but likely opened up into something larger. The mountains, he’d learned, were riddled with caves. It seemed obvious in retrospect, but he’d never found caves when he was a boy, so it never occurred to him to look. Even Ellie’s ‘home’ he’d thought of as more an anomaly at the time. It was a glaring oversight and severe failing of his childhood imagination and yet probably one that kept his younger self alive. He shuddered to imagine the trouble he'd have gotten into.

What bothered him most was that Rose had mentioned nothing of the beast’s sub-terrestrial territory. It wasn’t the first time she’d led him astray, but it was the most obvious of her omissions.

What he didn’t understand was why she left out important information. She always had detailed sketches of his intended prey — the latest of which now made a lot more sense given it lived under the earth — so it seemed impossible she wouldn’t know these things. She had to be leaving the details out on purpose.

But why? Misleading him like this would add days to the hunt, especially if he were looking for non-existent tracks of an animal that lived in caves. Wouldn’t all that wasted time eat in to her precious training, or had she actually grown tired of it, of him?

That idea was appealing, which meant it was certainly wrong. More likely, it was just another test of some sort.

“Or we could just stand here all day and stare at a hole in the ground. Could be relaxing, I suppose.”

He turned to her a blank stare as his mind continued to run through the implications.

She snapped her fingers in front his eyes. “Are you even in there?”

With a deep breath and a quick shake of his head, he dispelled the thoughts churning through his mind. She had a point. Standing here wasn’t going to get him any closer to finding his prey.

He shrugged off his pack and rummaged through it until he found the rope he’d stuffed near the bottom. He hadn’t had many opportunities to use the rope, but he did live in the mountains and rope was essential.

He glanced back at the hole and after a few moments of thought, removed his sword from his back, awkwardly stuffed it into the pack with the handle protruding a bit, tied the rope to the pack, and walked over to the hole. It would still be a tight squeeze.

Ellie placed a hand on his shoulder, causing him to jerk in response. “So _she_ taught you how to see?”  She always had a slight hint of disdain when she mentioned Rose.

“Yes,” he growled.

Rose’s way of teaching him to ‘see’ was to wrap a blindfold around his head and insist he train like normal. It had taken him weeks of beatings to figure out how to use his gravic senses to perceive her enough to defend himself. He’d lost control of his emotions several times, undoing in only a handful of days what had taken him years to push down. He still couldn’t reflect on that time without risking a crack in the walls he’d so carefully constructed to keep his emotions under control.

“I’m sorry,” Ellie said in a soft tone. Her eyes flicked to his hands, which had whitened in a clenched grip that dug fingernails into his palms. It took effort to release his grip and even out his breathing.

“Don’t be,” he said in a clipped tone. “Let’s go.”

He didn’t need her pity, and it was dangerous besides. That sort of thing had a way of breaking down his walls quicker than anything else.

He walked to the hole, crack, whatever, and after some effort, managed to squeeze his pack through, then feed it down with the rope. The pack caught several times but finally hit the bottom — or what he hoped was the bottom — just before he reached the end of his fifty paces, which he then tied to his harness.

He had to exhale all his breath to squeeze himself into the opening, and even then he still got stuck. Panic clawed at his throat while he tried to rapidly breath the very shallow leeway his chest had against the stone. Images of being crushed beneath a mountain cascaded through his head until he regained enough wits to push them down. On each exhale, he managed to move in just a little, his head turned sideways as shimmied himself further into claustrophobia.

All at once he was through and falling.

He smacked against the side of the cave before he instinctually reached up and anchored to the Whitewoods above to arrest his fall. It took him several seconds to catch his breath and push down the panic. He could breath now but the walls suddenly felt far too enclosing.

Once he’d settled down, he relaxed his mind and opened his senses. The trick with ‘seeing’ was to not be blinded. It had taken him a long time to realize that he’d been using his senses every time he anchored to a Whitewood. But the Whitewoods were so substantial, so ‘bright’ that they blinded him to everything else. It wasn't until he learned how to ignore them that he could sense anything around him. Yet once he did, he found most things seemed to have enough substance for him to sense, even inert objects like stone.

And so he gained a sense of the walls around him, which was little more than a deep crevasse that angled down. This hunt was not going to be pleasant unless it opened up at some point.

About half way down, he was struck with a wave of vertigo and nausea, which meant Ellie would be waiting for him on the bottom or even further in. He clenched his teeth and waited several minutes for the vertigo to settle down enough for him to continue. He tried very hard not to think about how she’d essentially bent him out of her way.

“Took you long enough,” she said as he touched down.

“Don’t do that again, please.”

“Oh? Do what?”  He couldn’t sense her face well, but the tone of her voice carried enough lilt that he imagined her innocent expression easily enough.

He knelt down to his pack, replaced his sword, and shouldered the pack. The way forward would force him to crawl, but not nearly so tight as that initial entry. It might open up further in but his senses weren’t good enough to tell for certain.

He twisted his head back around to Ellie, who was leaning casually against the wall with what he assumed was an amused smirk.

“Either go first or wait for me, but please don't go through me again."

"I didn't actually go—"

"You know what I mean."

"Sheesh, touchy much today?"

He gave her a flat stare before he realized they were in pitch black. He opened his mouth to respond but snapped it shut when he further realized anything he could say would only encourage her.

Also, she was right. He felt unusually irritable, but he chalked that up to almost suffocating beneath solid rock. Or perhaps the feeling of betrayal he felt at being misled. Or perhaps it was being forced to pursue his prey down into the depths of the earth itself. It could also be that he was forced to endure a petty girl who took nothing seriously. In fact, why not chalk it up to his whole cursed life in this hell that had no ending.

No, deep breath, push it down. He had prey to hunt, a task to do.

"You know, you really do stand around a lot, staring into space, a blank look on your face," Ellie said.

The noise he made at her may not have been polite.

It might have made him feel better but it accomplished nothing and after a couple moments he moved on to crawl forward and began his journey into the depths.

There was a term for people who explored caves. It was called spelunking, a word he learned in some book he'd been forced to read and no longer cared to remember. He did recall thinking that spelunking _sounded_ exciting, or at least interesting. Perhaps he'd confused the issue because exploring anything always sounded exciting to him.

This was not that.

Mostly, spelunking involved wandering down dead ends, loops, and meandering paths in the dark until coming to the terrifying realization that he was lost in the depths of the earth. That realization came like a knife in the back while he was trying to choose between two paths, only to realize it didn't matter. He'd been choosing paths at random until he couldn't tell if he was traveling toward his goal, away from it, or down a path he’d already been.

It was a metaphor for his life, blindly following dark paths that turned back on themselves endlessly. It didn’t matter what he chooses, where he walked, how he walked. His life would always be in the dark, guided only by pain, wandering down roads he couldn’t understand.

He chose a path, and then another, and with each choice flared anger. He came across another choice, a bifurcation without meaning, and he made it to follow another dark path that went nowhere. The choices didn’t matter, yet they were forced on him as taunts. He must choose, but the choice resulted in nothing but what had always been.

He wanted to rage at the dark, to scream his defiance, and yet he knew that it too would result in nothing more than what already was. So he kept that rage contained, a searing light that shone deep in his soul yet illuminated nothing, warmed nothing.

Another fork, another choice, another path that led nowhere.

He ran at times, walked at others, crawled in between. The dark had a way of obscuring the sense of time and place, rendering them meaningless. They were changes without meaning, progress toward no end, growth without a reference.

A hand pulled him to a stop and ripped him from dark, spiraling thoughts. He snatched his shoulder free and almost made to continue his futile pursuit but that was stupid. He shouldn't allow his anger to control him like that.

He shouldn't allow himself to feel anything at all.

He turned back instead and faced what amounted to little more than a blurred sense of a small girl beside him. She’d been there the whole time, behind him, following him through the dark, judging him with that infuriating smirk.

“Sometimes our sight blinds us. Sometimes it leads us astray. We rely on it to guide us but we only walk in circles, convinced of our progress even while we chase our own tail. Sometimes, we have to choose a different sense to see by.”

What the hell was she talking about? And why did she choose the weirdest moments to go serious?

He closed his eyes, changing nothing about what he saw, and tried to parse her words. Yet no matter how he tried, he couldn’t make his mind work properly. The words twisted with his own dark thoughts until they too lost their meaning.

“I don’t—“

She huffed. “Your nose, silly boy. Use your nose.”

That sounded more like her. He snorted and for some reason the amusement he felt dispelled his twisting thoughts.

He sniffed and tried to tease out scents that had long ago permeated his senses. It smelled like a cave. But had it been changing? He wasn’t sure. He hadn’t paid enough attention to know.

He walked to an intersection and instead of choosing at random, he tasted and sniffed the air of each path, one fresher, the other… musky? The difference was slight enough that it could be his imagination but he wasn’t sure it mattered. It gave him something to follow, some way to untwist the spiraled thoughts that ever threatened to drag him under. That alone made it worth the effort.

He chose the musk and tried not to hope that this time it would make a difference.

With each step his thoughts threatened to drag him into despair but now he had a task, a way to measure the progress. It was a flimsy defense but it held and with each decision the musk grew stronger.

Whereas time had felt obscured under the darkness, it now seemed to flow under the focus of the task at hand. He had no idea how long he’d been in the dark. They would get hungry and then eat, then walk more and follow the scent. He lost track of how many times they ate, but by the time they walked into a large cavern, he’d eaten at least half his provisions.

The smell was strong and vaguely reptilian, which matched his expectations from sketch, though they could easily have found some other creature’s lair. Whatever lived here wasn’t present, small mercy that. He felt oddly unprepared to walk into a fight.

“What did you say its name was?” Ellie said.

“Hmmm… a Growler?”

“Right…”

He skirted around the edge of the cavern and noted as many exits he could find, of which there were quite a few. Most of them appeared to be roughly the same size and oval in shape, definitely not natural.

“Do you think she just makes up the names?”

He turned to her with a frown, not that she could see it. “I… yeah, I guess so? She gives me sketches of my prey but I’ve never seen her sketch before.”

“Maybe she sketches them in her spare time?”

He snorted. “She has as much spare time as I do.”  He began to walk before a thought struck him. “And they’re wrong.”

“Wrong?”

He snorted out a frustrated noise; the conversation was getting under his skin. “I mean, they’re close, okay? The sketches are enough for me to find the prey, but they’re often off in the little details.”

“Like what?”

“Does it matter?”

“Maybe?”

He grunted annoyance and turned to continue his examination of an exit he found. It was almost a perfect oval and far too regular to be natural. He felt along the wall and found it glassy to the touch.

“It’s smooth.”

“Hmmm?”

“The wall, it feels like glass.”

He felt her press by him. “Huh. Odd,” she said after a moment, though she didn’t exactly sound interested.

He shoved by her to find the next hole in the wall, which was almost exactly like the previous one except for the direction it headed.

“How detailed are her sketches?” Ellie said.

“Very. I don’t think you could create a sketch like that without seeing the animal first — do you think the growler created these tunnels?”

“Could be? How should I know?”

“You knew it was down here.”

She remained silent and while he continued his inspection, the silence ate at him. After a couple minutes, it became too much. “You _did_ know it was down here, right?”

“Ahhh…”

“Seriously!? We’ve been down here for days!”

“I don’t think it’s been quite that—“

“Ellie,” he said with a quiet, dangerous tone.

“What?”

“You’ve seen this thing, right?”

“No… well, sort of?”

“What do you mean, sort of?”  The words came out through a clenched jaw.

“So, you called it a growler, right? And from the way you described it, it sounded like it would be below ground, right? So… well, I once heard something like growling deep in the earth before. I figured… you know?”

“You heard something once? Dammit, Ellie.”  Now he was shouting and all that twisting of his thoughts came rushing back. “We’ve been down here wandering in the dark for the gods know how long because _ you_ thought you heard something how long ago?”

“Ahh…”

“Shit. Of course you don’t know... _dammit_.”

He paced back and forth as he tried to think of a way to salvage the situation. They were lost deep within the earth with no real way to get back out. Could he try sniffing out the fresher air and follow that? Did he even have enough provisions to make it back out?

He growled in frustration. He never should have gone down here, never should have trusted her… and he couldn’t even decide which ‘her’ he was mad at.

“You really are touchy today, you know?”

“Seriously? What the hell, Ellie? We’re _lost_ down here. You led us to our deaths!”  He yelled out the last words, then struggled to get his breathing under control.

“Silly boy. We’re not lost. We’re only one step away from outside.”

He stopped and parsed the words she’d practically sung. “One step— oh no. No, but wait, you’ve kept track of where we went?”

“Of course, not that you made it easy or anything, but it would be incredibly stupid to explore the underground without a way to get out.”

His mouth worked words that refused to come out. While he’d been blundering in the dark, she kept track of how to get back to the light. He was furious with her, with himself, with everything. Yet he believed her. She would twist and compress reality, take that single step, and they’d find themselves back outside the hole he’d barely squeezed thought. And yet—

“Just how sick would I be from that one step?”

“Oh… a little? Ah yeah no, probably a lot.”

He suddenly felt trapped. He had all this anger but she’d kept track, she could take them out of here, no matter that he would be sick for hours. He had nowhere to vent his anger except at himself. He’d been stupid to come down here, stupid to think he could navigate an environment he’d never been in. He wanted to scream in frustration. He wanted to strangle her.

“Look on the bright side,” she said, “at least we found your growler.”

He stopped up short with clenched hands. “What are you talking about? There’s nothing here.”

He heard a deep in-breath and cut her off. “If you say ‘silly boy’ one more time, I swear—“

“Okay, okay. Sheesh, you really need to calm down. Just listen.”

It took far too long for him to calm down enough to actually listen, but when he did, he heard nothing but the normal sounds of a cave. Wait. What were the normal sounds of a cave? Like his sense of smell, certain sounds had long ago permeated his senses and been discarded as unimportant. He closed his eyes and tried to focus on everything his mind was actively ignoring.

It took too long. He felt agitated, annoyed, impatient. Several times he had to stop himself from giving up to start pacing again. It was only from years of practice that he was able to empty himself enough to pull together his fractured mind to hear what he’d been missing.

The sound was felt more than heard. A low rumble that might have echoed through the cave had it been loud enough. He couldn’t figure out when he’d started to hear it. He didn’t think it was there when he entered the cavern. It must have slipped in so slowly that he failed to recognize it.

“You hear it?”

He opened his eyes and turned to her out of habit, though it didn’t matter in the darkness. “Barely, like a rumble.”

“Or maybe a little like growling?”

Dammit but she was right. For some reason, that made him even more angry. It had been a stupid gamble to come down here, but the fact that it actually might have _worked_ really got under his skin. If she was right, there was literally nothing for him to be angry at her for, which just made him more angry.

“Fine.”

He sat down to wait. The rumbling was growing louder, albeit very slowly. After a few minutes, she sat down next to him in silence. That silence did not last nearly long enough.

“So what kind of details did she miss?”

“Wow Ellie, you really are stuck on that aren’t you?”

“Well?”

“Why is this so important?”

“You don’t find it odd?”

“Of course I do.”

“Well?”

He shook his head in frustration. “Just let it go.”

She huffed out an irritated noise through her nose, but didn’t press further.

Whatever was making the rumble, it was taking its time. He rummaged through his pack to find some food, though he wasn’t certain it was boredom, hunger, or just general frustration that drove him to eat. Chewing on jerky, though, seemed to relieve some of the pressure he felt. Underneath that, he discovered a small worm of guilt slowly eating at him. He really hadn’t been treating Ellie very well, but he was just so irritated with her that he found it difficult to do otherwise. Still, he should at least try to be nice, or something.

“It’s just small things, like the proportions are off, but only a little. Maybe the claws are a little longer, the face shaped differently, the body less or more muscular. Sometimes the way it moves or attacks or defends doesn’t match her descriptions.”

He fell silent again and waited, but Ellie remained silent because of course now she would choose not to respond. The girl was insufferable.

“At first, I thought it was just variances between individuals but the changes are just too… I don’t know, like she was sketching a different animal, a cousin or something.”

“Maybe the same animal, just a long time ago?”

“Huh… yeah, I guess it could be that.”  He frowned. Where was she getting the sketches from then?

“So she’s taking these out of some old book?”

“Right…”

The conversation was really getting to him. It was like Ellie was picking at a scab for a wound he really didn’t want to start bleeding.

“So then why is she—“

“*Ellie*,” he growled a warning.

“Yes?” her voice came back sweet and innocent, as usual.

He paused, swallowed a weak objection, “Never-mind, go on.”

“Why does she send you to hunt for things she’s never even seen?”

And now she got to the question he didn’t want asked. She was questioning his hunts, practically the only thing in his life that allowed him to keep his sanity. He didn’t _want_ to question it, he wanted to use it to recover. He wanted to keep himself together, and these hunts were the only thing that gave him room to put the pieces of himself back together.

“I don’t know why she does anything,” he snapped.

“Then why are you—“

“Because I have to. I have no choice,”  he snapped.

Because he’d chosen this, he’d chosen to believe it was necessary, essential. There was a monster inside him and this was the only way to control it. It couldn’t be random, couldn’t be meaningless. Because if it were, what did that make him? What was Rose making him into?

The rumbling — and he was forced to admit it did sound vaguely growl-like — had grown until it echoed throughout the cavern. At this point, they would be forced to speak over the sound had they words to say. It was a good excuse to not talk.

He stood up and weaved through the remains of stalagmites to the center of the cavern in an attempt to figure out where the noise was actually coming from. It didn’t help. The whole cavern was shaking. He walked back to the edge, and then around the circumference, and maybe it was louder on one side?

In the end, he didn’t want to risk being near the edge when he had no real idea of where it would come from, so he returned to the center to wait. Ellie joined him.

He removed his sword and waited some more.

“It's certainly taking its time,” she said.

He grunted a response that neither of them could make sense of. And then they waited.

The rumble eventually became a deafening roar that assaulted his ears until it almost hurt. A fire flared up in his gut in anticipation of the upcoming battle. Whatever this thing was, it was large. The adrenaline, focus, the battle… it all worked to remove tension, a release from so much pressure of endless failures that built up during training. Here he could strive and win. Here he was to be feared.

All at once the sound changed and grew to a crescendo. He spun until he found a section of the wall literally being pulverized several paces off the ground. What he sensed there was incredible. The creature was using a complex pattern of gravics to create a vibrating pattern of resonance and dissonance that literally ground solid stone into rubble and directed it all toward a mouth full of rounded teeth. Those teeth then refined it further before it swallowed the finely ground remains.

The growler literally ate stone. He would need to stay far, far away from that mouth if he wanted to survive this.

Almost as soon as the growler broke free of the wall, the sound evaporated into a deafening silence. He readied himself for battle against the ringing in his ears, but the growler hadn’t exited its hole, which barely appeared large enough to contain it. In fact, it seemed to be struggling.

It thrashed back and forth as it wiggled and shimmied its way out of the hole, albeit very slowly. It might have been vulnerable had been able to get behind it, but with all that thrashing he didn’t want to risk getting anywhere near that mouth.

After a couple minutes he grew bored and released the edge on his sword. As time passed into a multitude, he grew exasperated as it slowly pushed itself out, inch by inch, and with the ringing in his ears dying down, he could clearly hear the grunts of effort it made.

“Wow, that really looks like—“

“Don’t say it.”

“You can’t tell me that doesn’t look like the earth is shi—“

“Please stop, I… I just ate.”

Several paces of the creature had been… squeezed out of the hole when it unfurled its front legs from where they had been pressed into its side. Unlike the muscular, clawed appendages the sketch made out, these were stunted things with claws more akin to fingernails than anything intended to render flesh. The growler did use the legs to good effect as it leveraged them to push itself further out of the hole. Roland had a distant hope this whole ordeal would finish quickly, but its front legs didn’t quite reach the floor, so it reverted back to its grunting and squirming.

At just about the same time its front paws had reached the floor, the hind legs had been freed up. Roland grew excited at the prospect of an end in sight. The whole process had taken at least half an hour and it was just… utterly ridiculous.

With the hind legs freed, the growler gave one finally push and then slid out of the hole to plop down with an audible splat. The fall had created enough momentum to roll the thing onto its back, whereby it spent the next several minutes whipping a stubby tail around and clawing at the air until it finally rolled itself over.

The tail, he noted, had little stubby protrusions where the sketch had detailed out a wicked set of spikes. Roland had spent quite a bit of time strategizing about how to avoid that spiky tail.

It had to be farce. Whoever sketched the thing simply wasn’t content with the worm-like thing before him, and so imagined something fierce and intimidating instead.

Once properly oriented, the growler somehow managed to lift about forty percent of its body up using its four stubby legs, and then drag itself toward the center of the cavern. Both Roland and Ellie took a few steps back to let it go by.

It left a trail of something that glistened and — his eyes narrowed — so did the body of the growler. He followed the trail back to notice that the recently vacated tunnel also glistened.

“Slime?”  He couldn’t hide the disgust from his voice.

“Yeah…” Nor apparently could she. “So how does _this_ compare to your sketch?”  She gestured to the creature as it slowly crawled in front of them.

“It’s… ummm… well, it _is_ the same animal just… stunted? I mean, technically, I think this creature is larger… much larger.”

She giggled. “It is very rotund.”

The growler had made it across the cavern and then turned around several times before plopping down against the wall. The animal visibly relaxed, closed small beady eyes that Roland doubted saw much at all, then let out what he considered an excessive amount of air from its backside. He swore the thing visibly deflated. It smelled like sulfur.

Ellie somehow managed to look disgusted and riveted all at the same time. “Did it just fall asleep?”

He pressed his hand into his temple and groaned. Gods but she was right. It had walked — no, more like shuffled — right by them only to lay down and fall asleep.

“Well, oh mighty hunter. Your prey awaits you!”

He closed his eyes and tried to push down the frustration that was bubbling up. They’d spent forever chasing down a prey that was little more than an oversized worm.

“No, this is stupid. There’s no good reason to kill this thing.”  He replaced the sword on his back and turned back to the growler.

“Sorry, so there’s a good reason to kill the other animals you hunt?”

“Yes…”

“And?”

No, he would not get roped into that argument. Instead, he studied the sleeping animal. The longer he looked, the more he could see parallels to the sketch he’d been given. True, its neck had long ago been subsumed until there really was no distinction between head and body, but the shape of the head was vaguely reminiscent of the sketch, as was most its body if he subtracted a large amount of weight and added copious amount of muscle. The tail also had the right pattern of nubs.

The slime still glistened but appeared to be drying. Something about that niggled his mind, so he picked up a rock, walked over to the slime trail, and lightly touched the rock to it. It was tacky.

“Oh no. No… no, no, no.”

“You okay?”

He groaned and looked down at his hand. “I _ate_ with that hand.”

“Huh?”

“The tunnels…”

“What about the— oh!” She giggled but that quickly degraded into full-blown laughter.

He endured her laughter with incredible patience and aplomb. He didn’t kill her, didn’t attack her, didn’t strangle her. He executed no violence against her. It was a great triumph.

“Are you done?”

“So how much slime do you think you actually ate?”

“You’re not funny.”

“Oh no, not me.”

He growled at her and turned back to the stupid animal. The thing produced prodigious amounts of slime, especially if it covered the whole tunnel, which he was pretty sure it did. The slime must harden and reinforce the tunnel. Kind of ingenious, really. Already, the slime trail it left was drying into a dull reflection of— wait, reflection?

“Light?”  How had he not noticed? The slime _glistened_. There was light. He’d been looking at it with his eyes, not his senses.

“Well, I guess that’s it. If you’re not going to hunt this… clearly superior prey,” she giggled, “then I suppose we just need to go back.”

He stared at her proffered hand in confusion. “Light.”

“It’s probably some by-product of the slime.”

“What? No, how does that make any sense?”

“Come on, Roland. Your hunt is clearly defunct. Let’s go home.”

“Where’s the light coming from?”  And how had it taken him so long to realize it was there? He’d been in the dark for days now, or something. He’d have thought it would be glaringly obvious.

With rock in hand, he walked to the tunnel entrance, from which a very dim light spilled out. The tunnel entrance was too far up, but there was plenty of residue collected on the ground. He tapped the...slime, but just like the other tunnels, it had hardened into a solid surface. Out of curiosity — not anger, not frustration, just curiosity — he slammed the rock down against the coating with no small amount of satisfaction.

The rock shattered. He swiped the coating with his sleeve and barely found a scratch. The stuff was incredibly tough. It occurred to him that someone, someplace, might actually pay a fortune for a substance like this. Too bad it was buried far beneath the earth amidst the most dangerous forest in the world. There was a joke in there somewhere, he was certain.

“Roland, please don’t...”

He reached up to anchor but found no Whitewood in reach. At what point had he stopped looking for them?

Whatever, they were too far out now. He jumped up, barely managed to grip the tunnel edge, slipped, and then fell onto his back.

“Smooth.”

He got up and judged how he might manage it.

“Roland, it’s too far up. Let’s just go.”

It was too far up. But there were plenty of rocks around. He smiled. He just needed to focus on a task, and that was as good a one as any.

He spent the next several minutes carrying large broken pieces of stalagmite over to create a mound large enough for him to reach the tunnel. Ellie watched the whole thing with a concerned expression, not that he was paying attention. The growler never even stirred, despite the horrendous noise he made every time he threw down a rock. Apparently, eating stone was a tiring activity.

With a strong jump he collapsed his pile and managed a decent grip on the ledge. He had to claw and grasp to stay there but after a few panicked moments, he was semi-securely hung on the ledge from his arm pits, feet dangling over the edge. A deep breath, some more struggling, a little bit of swinging, and more luck than he’d like to admit, and he was panting heavily on his back, looking up at a girl who had simply _stepped_ up like it was nothing.

“I hate you so much right now.”

“Please don’t do this. We don’t belong here.”

He rolled his eyes. “Ruins, Ellie. There are _ruins_ here. Why the hell would I not explore them?”

“Don’t you understand? We *don’t belong here.*”

“It’s ruins. No one _belongs_ in a ruin... they just are.”

“You’re not listening to—“

“No, I’m done with this. I’m going. Come or stay, hell if I care.”

He stalked off down the tunnel without waiting to see if she would follow.

She would, of course. She always did. It was like she was tethered to him. No matter how she might object, she always followed him. It should have been flattering, comforting even that she cared, but all he felt was annoyance at her presence.

The blue-white light slowly increased in intensity as he walked down the tunnel. He was certain it was the same light that had shone in Ellie’s home — cell, whatever — and just as before, it felt off, different from the light he was accustomed to.

After a minute or so he came to a sharp bend in the tunnel. It was odd. The growler had clearly been heading in a direction, but just as soon as it broke through the wall and revealed the light, it veered off. The walls here were less smooth, as though it had ejected its slime unevenly in an attempt to get away. There were dips and patterns in the walls that looked violent, like the creature had been assaulted.

She stood behind him, silent. “Would you please step back. You’re crowding me.”

“Roland, don’t go in—“

He rounded on her in fury. “You know. I get you’re _scared_ of something. But in all my life, in all this hell that the gods forsaken woman has put me through, you want to take from me the one joy I could have. _RUINS_  Ellie. I want to explore ruins. I want to see something new. I want to explore... I want...” to be a boy again, to experience that sense of wonder, to forget the pain.

“Okay, okay... I just... Roland... okay.”  She looked defeated in a way that tried to break his heart. Instead, he rounded and walked into to the light.
