# 70 | Ruins

He stood in a hallway.

It was just a hallway, that’s all. White walls, floor grey with dust. All his hopes of finding ancient ruins and he finds himself in a gods forsaken hallway. That’s it. Nothing else to see. Why did he even come here?

No.

He hadn’t even started exploring. Hallways were good. They went places. He just needed to follow them.

“Roland—“

He cut her off with a sharp motion. He didn’t need the girl’s input. She would just distract him, try to pull him off his course. That’s what she always did, pulling and pushing so he couldn’t find what he needed. Why was she even here?

He took a step. And then followed it with another.

The hallway was long and curved ever so slightly that one might be convinced they looked down to the end, where the whites of the wall simply blended in with the curve. Time passed as he walked, but he seemed incapable of recognizing it. Then, at some point, he found himself standing before a door.

“Roland...”

Dammit, but she was crying. He hated that, hated her tears. It was manipulation, trying to get him to turn back. But he wouldn’t, he couldn’t, and she didn’t understand. These were ruins. He had to explore them.

He stepped up to the door and for the second time in his life heard a grating noise emanate from a door. It was the same sound her prison cell had made when he approached it. It recognized him, or something in him, and then rejected him.

Rage consumed him.

He pulled every bit of his considerable power and exploded it at the door, yet it shrugged off his effort as little more than a child’s tantrum. He couldn’t pull himself together, pull his power, pull anything. The pieces of him floated away at every effort. He should be able to destroy the door utterly, yet all he could achieve was little more than the pounding of a child’s fist against unyielding steel.

“Gods Roland—“

“You, shut it.”

He stalked down the hall. Every door rejected him. He need but walk close enough and that stupid, grating sound would fill the hallway. So he continued until he no longer understood why he walked.

Time lost... it wasn’t meaning, it simply stopped being a thing. He walked but causality lost continuity. He couldn’t distinguish one door from another, or know how much time passed between them because time didn’t pass. He would stand before one, then another, then back to the first. He would walk for years between doors, then they would crowd into every single step he made.

The girl stayed a pace behind him with every step, a constant reminder of his failure. She was a wraith, accusing him and questioning every choice he made by her presence alone. He hated her, hated her condemnation, the questioning of his judgement. He was the hunter, the explorer, not her. He alone would unravel the mysteries.

“Roland, can’t you—“

He rounded on the wraith. “And what are _you_ going do, huh? It belongs to me. I alone will unravel the mysteries. These ruins are mine, you understand, _mine_ to explore.”

“Oh, Roland.”

He walked, or he thought he did. The act of taking a step lost meaning. Distance didn’t matter when the hallway never changed, the doors were all the same, and the stupid girl behind him refused to leave.

The rejection sound became a background noise, a chorus to mark his steps, each door offering a semblance of time without its substance. His mind tried to pull the sound into a rhythm but it always came as a surprise. He tried to count his steps but two refused to come after one, so that every time he thought of a number it might as well have been random. His thoughts wouldn’t pull together, so he walked. It was a task to do, the only thing that he could do, and it was all he had.

A chime shattered the hallway, or his mind, he wasn’t sure. He turned around in confusion to see a girl behind her. She looked familiar but he couldn't find the thread in his mind that led to her.

“Hi,” he said, though the word felt strange on his tongue.

“Hi?”  She sounded confused. “I think…”

“Yes?”

“No, I ah… are we lost?”

He looked around but all he saw was a hallway. “How can we be lost? It’s just a hallway.”  Anger tried to flare but it felt as though under water.

“Oh… what about the door?”

He turned around to see the doorway, though what happened to the door he didn’t know. Surprise tried to wiggle around in his mind but quickly went dormant.

“Seems better than the hallway,” he said and walked through.

He staggered to a stop just a couple paces in the room. The pieces of his mind immediately snapped together to bring several realizations cascading. He'd wandered in that hallway for a long time, but the memories there were fragmented. Something was very wrong with this place, but for some reason he couldn't seem to care.

He turned back to Ellie, who also had stopped a pace behind him with a curiously flat expression on her face.

“The hallway shattered our minds,” she said in a tone that matched her face.

“It did. Time and causality stopped making sense to me.”

“You were very angry.”

“Yes, I was.”

Her eyes darted around in thought. “And now?”

“Now? Now, I… feel nothing.”

“I don’t either.” Her words sounded forced, tentative, and emotionless.

He nodded in response but it felt more like a force of habit than anything else. They stared at each other for several minutes, or hours, or some time that he couldn't bother with the effort of counting. Thoughts churned just under the surface of a calm sea that refused to be breached. Instead, just as the thought would near the surface, it would dart back down into the depths. He could think clearly, but he couldn’t bring those thoughts to generate an action, not even to speak.

He turned and walked, that also more from habit than any desire.

“What are you doing?”

He turned back to her. “Walking.”

“Why?”

“Why not?”

She shrugged, as though the question didn’t matter.

“Walk with me,” he said. Something about the request seemed in line with his life but only as a matter of course. It was a habit that called forth something that  had always been. She's always followed him because of course she did.

“Why?”

“Why not?”

She shrugged again and walked to him. He turned and walked further into the room, her just a pace behind him. He recognized that this was common, but didn’t care to think anything more on the subject.

The room was large and circular, with a central, round table in the center. He did not see any chairs for the table, but near the edges of the room were several odd looking chairs. The chairs were made of steel and gravwood, where the gravwood was intricately ingrained in patterns that looked intentional. On the armrests and near the legs were gravwood restraints, though open at the moment. From behind the back of the each chair a set of six spidery, gravwood arms with sharp ends were poised, though inert. From each chair a long, gravwood channel had been embedded into the floor and led to the table in the center. There were several instruments scattered on or secured to the table.

They walked around the periphery of the room until they reach a door, which was smaller than the one they’d entered. It too made that abrasive sound when Roland approached, but then opened as Ellie approached from behind.

“The doors don’t like you,” she said. She should sound surprised, but it came out as little more than statement of fact.

He thought he should reply, but it refused to materialize. Instead, he stared at what appeared to be a closet. Inside where several long, dark-grey coats, hats that sat on a ledge above it, and below the coats were several drawers.

His eyes took in the details of the coats and hats, and several time it occurred to him that he could open the drawer, or take a coat or a hat, or do something other than stare at the closet. But just as before, the thoughts refused to connect to an action.

“We’re going to starve.”  Ellie had spoken again after time he could have tracked, but didn’t care to. Somewhere in his mind it occurred that the mere fact she did so was remarkable. She was also right. His stomach felt empty, almost painful, and even that didn’t seem important.

They were stuck in apathy and he couldn't muster up enough courage, enough emotion, enough _anything_ to care. There was a barrier between what he knew and what needed to be done, and never the two should meet.

He walked.

It was an impulse, again something out of habit, some thought randomly connecting to an action even though thoughts didn’t do that here. He walked and they both came to a door. Yet again the door rejected him, but like before, it then immediately accepted Ellie as she approached from behind. Roland hadn’t fully stopped walking and so allowed his momentum to carry him into a smaller room because it didn’t really matter either way.

He gasped as soon as he entered the room.

“Woah…”  Several emotions assaulted him. Anger, guilt, confusion, revulsion, horror, pain— wait, was pain an emotion? He decided at that moment it really was. Gods but he was hungry. “Ugh… wow.”

He rounded back to Ellie but she was still standing just on the other side of the door frame with a blank look on her face.

“Ellie, come here.”

“Why?”

“Come on Ellie, just do it.”

She returned to him a blank stare but didn’t move. It took a moment to think back to his own time in the room and realize that she simply couldn’t find a reason to move, or to do anything at all. The mere fact she’d followed him at all suddenly seemed remarkable, as did the fact that he walked in the first place. Habit, it seemed, was the only thing that could counter perfect apathy.

He almost reached out to drag her in, but a sharp stab of dread kept him from it. Whatever was happening in that room, he really didn’t want to risk getting trapped again.

He churned the problem over in his head. How do you convince someone with no motivation to do something when any option was the exact same as the other? Yet she had followed him, so there was something, a way.

“Ellie, walk with me.”

Her eyes flicked back into focus and trained on him, though her expression didn’t change. “Why?”

“Why not?”

She shrugged and took a step, then gasped.

Then she hit him, hard.

“Dammit Roland, I _told_ you this place was dangerous.”

“Yeah, yeah, okay, I know. You were right.”

She harrumphed. “That’s not the point.”

“I know, okay… it’s just, well _ruins_, Ellie. How could I pass that up?”

“Are you whining?”

He blinked. “Uh, no?”

She rolled her eyes, then walked around the small room. “How about we eat first and then— wait, where’s your pack?”

He stomach lurched at the realization that his pack wasn’t on him. “I must have dropped it.”

“Where?”

“It wasn’t this last room,” he gestured at the now-closed door, “I would have remembered. So it must be in the hallway. My memories of that place are jumbled.”

She nodded, “It seemed to affect you more than me, at least at first. You were really angry.”

“Listen about that, I’m really—“

“Let’s just figure out a way to get out of here, okay?”

He paused with a conflicted expression, but after a moment found himself. “Yeah, sure.”

He looked around at the room. At first he thought it felt different from the prior room but quickly realized that was a stupid observation given the last room removed all motivation. He was just glad he hadn't stated it out loud.

There were quantifiable differences though. For one, the room was square — rectangular actually, not that the difference mattered. There was a long counter that ran along one long wall with cabinets above. One of the cabinets looked different, with what looked liked gravwood embedded into it, but whatever function it performed had been lost to time, or at least was lost to him. The counter was covered with mounds of dust. In the center of the room was a small round table with cheap-looking chairs scattered around it.

Perhaps the most important feature of the room was the one door that led back to the apathy room, or at least that was what Roland had coined it.

He groaned and turned to Ellie as the implications came crashing down on him. “We're trapped.”

Her jaw dropped. “It took you that long to realize this?”

“It's... I... ugh, you know what—“  He stopped short at the mischievous look on her face.

“You're too easy...” She trailed off and looked confused for a moment.

Something about that clicked in his head. “Ohhh...”

She gave him a flat look. “Care to share Mr. genius?”

“Genius, huh?”

“No, wait. Something’s still wrong.”

“Yep.”  Though he had a massive grin on his face.

“Oh shit... no! Ack, what the hell— dammit!”

“Ah, so that's what goes through your head.”

“No! This is not fair!”

“That's okay, there's literally no one I'd rather be trapped here than with than you.”

They both looked stunned at his confession. Ellie, unable to keep her emotions in check, turned her back to him and walked to the corner. Her shoulders shuddered for a moment, but then she turned back to him with a clear face.

“Let's find a way out of here.”

“I—“

“No! We find a way out of here, that's all.”

He stared at her, tried to comprehend what was going on but failed miserably. What he did understand was that this room forced expression. It too strongly connected thoughts with action, emotions with expression, almost like it was a counterbalance of the prior room. But that would threaten to expose what was not ready for the light. It was starting to dawn on him that this might be the more dangerous room.

“There's only a small problem of the room that— wait, can you just step out?

She visibly deflated. “No.”

“Why—“

“I can't walk through walls or doors or any solid object Roland, or did you forget about that?”

He paused in surprise. “Wow Ellie, touchy much today?”  Dammit, that was the wrong thing to say.

She stilled, her face smoothed into nothing, but that lasted barely a moment before hurt flickered across her face and then stilled again. She was not handling things well.

This room would be the death of them if they didn't get out soon. But that brought him back around to the question of how. He flicked his eyes around the room and found nothing, then sat down on a flimsy chair that creaked and flexed under his weight. For some reason, that was almost as disconcerting as the room was.

After a moment to ensure the chair held, he turned his eyes back to her. “Okay, so how?”

She sat across from him, then twisted her face toward the chair below her with an incredulous expression. He shrugged in response. Some mysteries were simply not meant to be known.

“I would have thought they'd produce better chairs.”

Roland grunted an agreeable noise and then shifted in his seat to get comfortable. It squeaked in protest yet seemed to offer no real comfort. After a few seconds of this, he gave up and leaned back to an audible groan from the chair that cut off with a loud snap.

He landed on his hip in a painful thud.

Ellie giggled as he scrambled to pull himself up off the floor. The chair had slid out to the side and left him halfway under the table. His first instinct was to grab the edge of the table but that only tilted it at a precarious angle.

“Hey!” Ellie grabbed her side of the table and shoved it back down.

“Ow!” His head smacked the floor as the table edge was snatched out of his hand. He rolled over, pushed himself up, grabbed another chair and tentatively sat down on it, his elbows propped up on the table.

They stared at each other, then at the table, then at the walls. Neither of them felt the need to risk speech without need. After some time, Ellie pulled out some food from her pack, started to eat, then on second thought shoved some of that food at Roland, who’d watched her with an incredulous expression.

“What _is_ that?”

“Hmmm? Oh, dried mushrooms.”

It looked disgusting. Did she really eat this stuff? And how had he never noticed that before? He gave the food an appropriately skeptical expression, picked up a piece, and ground his teeth on the chewy substance.

“Water?” he said through the food in his mouth.

“Ugh, seriously. You can’t even swallow first?”

“Since when’ve you been so—“

“You know what, never mind. Here.”

She almost threw at him a small flask that he quickly discovered was half full. He took a swig to wash down the gummy food, then shook the flask with a frown. Only half of what she'd offered remained and it wasn't nearly enough. He handed the flask back to her.

“We really need to get out of here,” he said.

“Good idea, genius… have any more brilliant ideas?”

No, he did not, and he bit down a sarcastic reply with considerable effort. They were trapped in a room that seemed to force their words to be… what, true? Did they have to tell the truth? On a whim, he turned his eyes to her.

“You have brilliant blond hair and perfectly blue eyes.”

Her jaw dropped in an expression he’d have paid almost any price to repeat. He seared that expression into his mind. Whenever she annoyed him, he was sure this memory would make him feel better.

“Have you lost your—“

“Well, we can lie at least.”

“We can what?”  She looked utterly baffled. It was glorious.

“The room. We can lie. It doesn’t force us to tell the truth.”

But even as he said that, he realized that was only partially true. Her hair was black, but it was brilliant and he’d always thought so. Her eyes weren’t perfectly blue, they were perfectly green. He’d lied, yes, but there was an underlying truth in his expression.

Her eyes darted in thought. “The room couldn’t possibly ’know’ what’s true. But it could effect how you express and—”

He nodded vigorously. “—and remove the filters from our thoughts to our words.”

A small smile flickered across her face. “Yes, I think so.”

“But as soon as we walk out this door, we take two steps only to loose all motivation to take another.”

“Maybe if we run?”  Her tone was skeptical.

He snorted. “To the hallway that fractures our minds?”

They fell silent as their thoughts chased many directions, yet found no answers. The longer he thought, the more he realized it was luck alone that had gotten them here in the first place. Well, that and his unparalleled ability to focus combined with unyielding stubbornness. Whatever had spurred his obsession to explore the ruins seemed to have fled, though. He had no doubt that were he to step into the adjacent room, he’d never take another step again.

“I wonder if every room is like this?”

She looked up and something like recognition flickered across her face. “I think so.”

After a minute of silence, he prodded more. “Well?”

“What?”

“You obviously thought of something.”

She shook her head just a little too vigorously. “Nothing that’ll help.”

He blinked at her and stared until she huffed and rolled her eyes. “Fine. My… home.”

“Where your parents live?”

“What? No, where I live now.”

“Oh right, the prison cell.”

“You know it’s not nice to call—“

“But it’s true.”

“Are you—“

“No, no! Listen, it is. It’s some kind of prison, right?”

She scowled at him but he was too excited to let that bother him— or satisfy him, whatever.

“What does your cell— errr, home do?”

She turned her head away and spoke quietly. “It _feels_ familiar, nice. Like… I dunno, it feels like home, like I don’t really need to leave. ”

He nodded but it took effort to hold down the sarcasm. Homey is not how he'd would describe her cell. Still, her words confirmed a theme he’d started to chew on.

“A cell that makes you feel at home, hallways you walk in circles in, a room of… of apathy, and this?”  He gestured around to the surrounding white walls.

She shrugged. “Well, it does lead into the apathy room.”

“Right, but how did they do it?”

“How do they do what?”

“The guards! Prisons have guards right?”

“Right…”

“So how did they walk around? How did they do _anything_?”

“That’s actually a really good—“

“No wait, not a prison.”

“What? But you just said—“

“—or not _only_ a prison.”

“Would you please make up your mind?”

He looked back over to her, who was staring at him with an exasperated patience. “What’s the point of that room?”  He pointed at the only door in the room.

She shook her head and this time he rolled his eyes at her.

“Or how about the spider chair in there?”

“I try not to think about those.”

“Right, not just a prison.”

“Okay, but how does that help us?”

He let out a deflated sigh. “I dunno. But they walked around, so there must be a way.”

He walked around the room, suddenly feeling claustrophobic in the confined space. He felt excited, antsy, and a little confused. His thoughts churned as he sought an answer, something, anything to get them out of here.

Deep breath, push it down. There was no empty here, nothing to embrace except his own agitation, which he suspected  He closed his eyes and opened his senses, then gasped.

“What?”

Ellie stood and walked over, but he was distracted by the sheer amount gravic energy coursing through the walls. Or not just through the walls. It seemed to fill the very air itself. They were, he realized, under a constant attack of some sort.

“Can you see it all?”

“See what?”

“There’s gravics all throughout the walls.”

“Yes, and?”

He snapped his eyes open and stared at her with a furrowed brow. “You don’t find that amazing?”

“No, why should I?”

“Because—“

“What kind of back-water village did you grow up in?”

“Hey now—“

“It’s just a power delivery system.”

“Okay but the air—“

“Also, it’s really annoying when someone keeps interrupting isn’t it?”

He came up short. “Ahh, right. Sorry.”

“Mmm hmm.”

He let out a sigh and returned his attention to the problem. They might never leave if they allowed themselves to continue this bickering.

“There has to be a way,” he said after another minute of silence.

“There _has_ to be a way? Why? Why would there _have_ to be a way? Not all situations have a solution. Not everything works out.”

“That’s… depressing.”

“Well, it’s the truth. We don’t always get our way. Not everyone gets to live, Roland.”

“Wait, what we we talking about?”

She drew in a trembling breath, held it, then let out an angry growl. “Never mind, let’s just find a way out of here.”

“Yeah but—“

“*Drop* it.”

He threw up his hands. “Okay, okay. What about the closet?”

But she wasn’t there, her eyes distant on some thought or memory. After a few seconds, she seemed to find herself enough to reply. “What closet?”

“The one in the apathy room?”

She shook her head with a baffled expression.

“Really? We spent a long time staring at it, or at least I did— what were you doing?”

She shrugged. “At some point, I had to focus on you or I’d stop following you.”  She shivered. “The last thing I remember was the chairs.”

“Oh, okay.”  Her answer made him oddly uncomfortable, but without anything concrete, he was forced to let it slide. “Well, there’s a closet.”

“And you think we can get out through the closet?”  She tapered the words off slowly, making it very clear she thought he was an idiot.

He growled at her. “No, but maybe the clothes in the closet can help?”

“Clothes? Listen Roland, I like cloths as much as the next girl but I—“

“They’re different.”

“Interrupting again.”

“Well, you’re just being sarcastic and I think those clothes might be the solution.”

“Fine. So how are clothes supposed to be a solution?”

“Well, maybe if they’re some kind of gravic device?”

“*In* the clothes?” She looked confused but thoughtful. “Yeah, I suppose—“

“So we just need to get to the closet right?”

“Is the door open?”

“Well no.”

“How many times do I need to say this? I cannot walk through solid objects.”

“But the door opens for you—“

“So?”

“*So*,” gods below but she was pissy, “we bring the door to us.”  Her blank stare prompted further explanation, and definitely not a sarcastic reply, because that would only derail them yet again. “Okay, I’ll try again. Can you bend space so the door is in front of us?— or maybe not us, you. Definitely you. I don’t think I’d be functional after that.”

“Ah, no.”

“Oh. Well okay, is that a definite no or a maybe no?”

“Definite.”

“Are you—“

“Yes, I’m sure. Listen Roland, I can bend space, at least as you call it, but that allows me to move through what is essentially altered space, not objects. I can’t rearrange the configuration of a room, especially when it’s practically encased in gravwood.”

“Dammit, I was sure that would work.”

Roland began pacing again, feeling unsure if his agitation was normal or prompted by the room’s effect, an effect that seemed to permeate the whole room, the air itself. He stopped suddenly and cocked his head. Or perhaps it was the gravics messing with their mind, like Ellie’s “talent” messed with his.

He turned to her. She’d been watching him pace with an amused expression. “You find this amusing?”  That hadn’t been what he meant to ask.

“Yes. You’re never this expressive. It’s… refreshing.”

“Yeah and you’re never quite this pissy and—“

“Pissy?”

“—we really need to figure—“

“Did you just call me _pissy_?”

Uh oh.

“Pissy? Oh, you haven’t seen pissy yet. You want to see pissy? How about— what?”

“Huh?”

“It’s not working…”

“What’s not— wait, did you just try to bend space around me?”

“Maybe?”

“Dammit, Ellie. That would screw me over for hours. We need to find a way out of here.”

“But why isn’t it working?”

He paused, his thoughts turning back into his original idea. “So, still think all this energy floating around is natural?”

“It always bleeds a little,” she said pensively, but clearly less certain that before.

“What does?”

“Energy transfer. There’s no such thing as a perfect system. Energy always bleeds. It’s normal. You’d know that if you weren’t—”

“Intentional.”

“Would you stop—“

“I’ll stop interrupting when you stop insulting me.”

She huffed and visibly struggled to get herself under control, but without her ability to bend space it didn’t feel quite so threatening as it might otherwise. The flower-picking girl could no longer become the goddess. He almost said just that until he realize just how stupid that would be. Still, it was hard to keep the comment in.

“Fine,” she said after a moment, “let’s just assume the energy is messing with us — which is a stupid idea but whatever. That still doesn’t help us.”

“Maybe.”

Her jaw clenched. “Care to elaborate?”

“No, not really.”

Her eyes grew wide as he turned his back on her, sat down crosslegged on a random spot on the floor, and closed his eyes. At this point, anything they said would make the situation worse. Even knowing this, he really wanted to say something, anything. The only thing that kept the words in his mouth was the knowledge that his silence pissed her off.

He turned his attention inward. His cycle was… not doing well. The threads of energy were frayed and bleeding out, clearly under assault by the room’s energy. That was concerning, almost as much as the fact that he hadn’t noticed before now.

The room’s effect radiated from the walls and presumably people had once functioned in here, so likely they shielded themselves. Yet when he tried to form a shield, nothing happened. The very energy felt disrupted, not only by the room, but by himself.

He took a deep breath, pushed the frustration down, and focused on his cycle. It had always been a source of strength, of order and control. Repair it, and perhaps he could find just enough to get a shield himself.

The threads were slippery, very much like his first attempt to create it. Not impossible, but he lost track of time — which seemed to be a theme lately — as he put everything back into harmony. Once he was done, he quickly tried again to form a shield. It didn’t work, but it was more a problem now with the room than with him. It seemed to disrupt the normal dance of harmonics necessary to form a surface. Yet he was sure this was the answer. A shield would explain everything. So there had to be a way to form one, and he had an idea of how.

It took several more minutes, hours — he wasn’t sure — as he tried modulating the frequencies. While he had a basic understanding of how this was done, it was primarily a theoretical he’d learned rather than anything practical. Everyone seemed to use their own harmonies when forming a shield, and so long as it worked, nobody questioned it, at least so far as he was aware. The process of learning gravics was something like developing a personal language with the forces. It was a negotiation between the tuning of the body, and reality itself. Using another language was difficult and foreign, but he quickly noticed that some attempts met with more resistance than others. By following the dips and hills in resistance, he finally hit on a harmonic that would work.

A shield snapped out in front of him. He immediately felt both a release of pressure from his head and a weariness that assaulted him at the same time. Ignoring both, he pulled the shield in and began to wrap it around him. He was very, very far from being a shaper, but he had learned how to position and wrap his shield, which was the extent of his skill. He’d never wrapped one fully around himself and thought it should be tricky, but it snapped together almost like it wanted to once he drew the shield almost directly around him.

He almost fell over as weariness fully assaulted him. How long had he been awake?

He pushed the thought out. It didn’t matter, and he had a task now. He rose to his feet and looked over to Ellie, who was sitting at the table, head propped against her hand, a very annoyed look on her face.

“I got it.”

Her eyes narrowed as she lifted her head, then she raised both hands. It took him a moment to realize she couldn’t hear him. He pointed at the door. She shook her head. He walked to it but of course it didn’t open. The doors here hated him. He looked back at Ellie but she had an imperious look that spoke of no intention to move.

He closed his eyes, realizing he’d need to talk to her, and almost fell asleep on his feet. He quickly opened them and, because he felt utterly exhausted, he simply dropped his shield. Maybe he could have reopened his shield but he felt too tired to try.

A layer of angst immediately smothered his tiredness. Hope surged in him. He had a solution so long as he could convince Ellie to follow along. Several dozen sarcastic comments flooded to the foreground of his mind, forcing him to push them back down before he said something stupid.

“Okay, I have a way out of here, but I need you to trust me.”

“Yeah, no.”

“*Ellie*.” he gritted his teeth, wait a moment for the anger to subside, then continued in as level a voice as he could maintain. “Ellie, I’m sorry for being mean to you.”  That was hard. “But please trust me.”

Her lips pressed in but after a moment she nodded.

“I can shield myself, so I can get to the closet, but I need you to come with me so the door will open and… I can’t shield you.”

“Wait, so you want me to walk out there? And how do you know your shield will work out there? We could just end up stuck there, dying because we can’t find the motivation to take another step.”

“Okay, so if you open the door, I’ll walk out, wait a few seconds, and then come back.”

“What? So you can leave me here all alone?”  Her breathing came more rapidly now.

“No that’s not—“

“No… no, you don’t get to leave me alone.”

She stood and paced, back and forth while muttering to herself. He bit down his own words. He barely trusted himself to speak and feared anything he would say would derail them both.

“Fine… okay, fine.”  She had tears in her eyes as she turned back to him. “But you better not leave me, okay?”

“Yeah, Ellie. Of course—“

“Promise me.”

“Ellie, why would I leave—“

“Say the words. Promise me!”

He took a step back, confused at the intensity in her words and expression, uncertain that he was promising more than he knew.

“I promise, Ellie, I won’t leave you behind.”

“Okay, okay.” she sound like she was trying to convince herself. “Let’s do this now before I change my mind.”
