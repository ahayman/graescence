# 25 | Caught [Anna]

Stasia was being followed.

She caught a glimpse of motion on the periphery that disappeared when she looked. But she'd seen it, of that she had no doubt. And now the streets were too quiet, too empty.

The man's whistle had been a signal. She grew more certain the more she thought about it. So then what happened? Where was the ambush? Why was it so quiet? There had been people here before. Not many, but people. Why would they just leave?

A sense of foreboding wrapped around her. She quickened her pace, her eyes darting to the shadows.

If it was just an ambush, that made sense. It wasn't ideal, but it made sense. What didn't make sense was no ambush, a quiet street, an empty street, as though it were an impending ambush that refused to happen.

Maybe she scared them off. Seeing a dagger blow though a building had to be impressive, even if everything here was made of cheap wood. Maybe the ambush was only a couple people and they figured, rightfully so, that it would be death to confront her. That was possible.

Why was the street was empty?

She almost broke into a jog, but motion from the side caught her short. She turned, one of her relic daggers suddenly in hand.

But she hadn't grabbed the knife.

She stopped, confused, as someone stepped out of the shadows. He was a giant of a man, with blue eyes, short hair, a barrel chest, and a braided beard. He had no shirt, revealing several well-defined scars on his body. Leather straps crossed his chest, with two cutlasses attached behind, their pommels sticking out over each shoulder. To complete the ensemble, a skin of some sort was wrapped around his neck and draped over one shoulder.

It was possibly one of the most absurd things she'd ever seen, all made worse because she knew him.

“Sheth?”

“Princess.”

“What... the... fuck?”

Sheth shrugged. “Did you really think you could sneak out?”

Stasia stumbled back as though struck. She closed her eyes and wavered as the world tightened around her throat, making it hard to breathe. All this day was but the illusion of freedom, her guard only just out of view. She'd never truly been in danger; she'd never truly been free.

Her breath came shaky, but she forced it in deep and held it until her head felt light and the rage in her soul had been smothered under necessity. She was the princess, and princesses didn't kill their guards.

She opened her eyes. Sheth looked concerned and wary. She walked over to him and plucked at the skin on his shoulder.

"Is that a bear skin?"

Sheth glanced over at the skin, smiled fondly, and nodded while his shoulders relaxed. He let out a slow breath.

"Where did you get it?"

"It was a gift."

Her face fell. "The other elites gave you a bear skin?"

He nodded. "It's good skin."

"You have to know they're making fun of you."

"Of course, that's how it works."

"How what works?"

"Men."

She stared at him. "No Seth, and besides, half the elites are women."

He shrugged. "Same difference."

"Huh?"

He shook his head and gave her a patronizing smile. "I know you don't understand, princess, but this is how it works. We make fun of each other; it's how we get along."

"But they're trying to turn you into a barbarian. It's so...so _racist_."

"So?"

She snorted out her annoyance. While Seth was large and northern, he had grown up a farmer among a group of pacifists, only learning of his martial prowess later in his teens. To his family's dismay, he joined the military and quickly rose through the ranks. He was intelligent, light on his feet, and showed tactical genius in most situations... yet, when he walked into a room, all anyone could see was his northern blood.

Rather than fight it, he appeared to be leaning into the stereotype.

She shook her head. Maybe he was right; maybe she just didn't understand. In her circles, she would be well within her rights to kill someone for giving such a blatant offense.

"May I see it?"

Stasia opened her eyes and stared at Seth in confusion, then noticed he was looking at her hand.

No, the knife. She lifted it to look. How had it gotten there? She hadn't grabbed it; It simply appeared when she needed it. She couldn't decide if that was good, but it was certainly dangerous.

She shook her head and handed it over. He flipped it around, looking closely at the craftsmanship, or so she presumed, though she wondered if he would even know what it was.

"A relic," he said.

Okay, maybe he did know.

"A very illegal relic." He looked at her. "There's a kind of tether, right? Let's you call it back. Double-edged, flips its surface at will?"

She nodded numbly as she tried to figure out how he would know all that. It had taken her over a year of research, all based off an obscure book to figure find out that something like this even existed, much less how it worked. She suddenly became very curious about the Elite’s training regimen.

He flipped the knife into the air, caught it, then handed it back to her. "Keep this a secret. If the Empire finds out you have this, not even your father can keep you safe."

She looked at him in alarm. "Does he know?"

Seth shook his head.

Her eyes narrowed. "Will he know?"

"Not unless he asks." He raised his hands at her glare. "He won't, princess; he never does. He doesn't even know you're here." He gestured around him. "As far as I know, he thinks you're up to the same kind of antics as your brothers."

"I do not frequent pleasure—"

"Not the _exact_ same thing, just...you know, shopping."

She gave him a flat stare.

"Well, aren't you?"

She opened her mouth to protest, only to realize one could potentially call this shopping, a very dangerous form of shopping, but still shopping.

She let out a quick breath. "Seth, why are you here?"

"To keep you safe. It's is my duty—"

"I don't need prot—" Her eyes widened suddenly and her shoulders dropped. "The ambush, that was you?"

He nodded. "About fifteen of them."

Shit. She'd expected something, but not that. Couriers don't normally travel in gangs. Of course, at least half the slums were in some kind of gang, but she really thought she'd covered her basis.

"You kill them?" she asked. She hoped he didn't — that was a lot of death on her shoulders — and yet it would solve a lot of problems if he had.

"A couple. The rest are sleeping off a headache."

"They saw you?"

"Hard not to."

Shit, shit, _shit._ She ground her teeth in frustration. If word got back to her contacts that an elite took down an entire gang for her, it would be a short second for them to realize she was a Royal. All of that work cultivating contacts would evaporate, burning a persona she spent years developing; all of it, just gone.

She had the sudden urge to use her new weapon on a few sleeping— wait. "Why are you grinning?"

His smile deepened. He glanced at the bear rug on his shoulder.

It took her a moment to realize why. "Oh! You beautiful barbarian." He wasn't wearing a single thing that would identify him as an elite.

He chuckled. "Come, princess, we have to get back." He began to walk away.

"Why?" She planted her feet firmly in place. Her eyes narrowed. "You have a date or something?"

He snorted. "Your father's been summoned. Courier came by gate this morning. We leave before sunset."

"Leave?" She frowned and cocked her head. "How?"

"By ship."

She tapped her foot. "So the Emperor felt the need to send a summons by portal, but not bring us back by that portal?"

He shrugged, then gestured with his head and began walking without waiting for a response. She caught up, and walked beside him, as she tried to tease out the meaning of the summons.

"Were the summons for him or all of us?"

Seth shrugged.

Probably just for him, and not providing a gate back was a certain message of Emperor's displeasure, intended for the journey to make her father... nervous. That wasn't right. Her father was many things, but prone to worry was not one of them. Knowing him, he'd try to turn it into an opportunity, which was why he brought his family.

That sounded right.

_Or..._ he was offered the gate, and chose to travel by ship instead. That didn't quite line up, though: if the Emperor felt the need to deliver a message by gate, he wouldn't allow her father to waste weeks on a ship instead. Or, well, maybe; it depended on the nature of the summons.

Would he bring the court? She hoped not, but she couldn't see them not coming. Set aside the offense of being snubbed, one simply didn't leave a nest of vipers to guard your home; you'd come home to find the vipers fat and the children gone. Besides, the capital was a great place to permanently remove rivals, an opportunity few would give up, not the least her; she already had a few ideas for an accident or two that needed to be arranged if she had the time.

Too many unknowns; barely half a day from court and she was already out of the loop. She could practically _feel_ the need to get back as ropes tightening in her mind, closing her in, demanding participation for survival. It was an addiction. Look away, and you might miss something vital, something that could kill you, someone you needed to kill first. Look away and you might give up an advantage; look away and you might find a dagger in your back.

The memory came unbidden: her best friend, dagger in the back, a shocked face reflected in the mirror.

She shoved it down. Now was not the time for weakness. The court was an unseen labyrinth designed to trap the intelligent and trick them into murdering each other. It was called politics, and she was trapped in it.

Clarissa. She would talk to Clarissa first, then Shia. Clarissa would give her a lot of information, but most of it gossip and unreliable, delivered in an endless stream of chatter. Shia lied compulsively, yet Stasia had found she could compare the stories between them for nuggets of truth; she could, if only she could stand the endless drivel that came out their mouths.

Sometimes, in her dreams, she twisted the dagger.

No. Blink it away.

She would talk to her brothers — the twins — next, assuming they were back from their carousing. Stasia sighed; probably not. They'd walk onto the ship stylishly late, drunk, laughing, and oblivious to the angry stares. Yet somehow, they were always an excellent source of information and never lied to her, family bonds and all that. She'd never been able to figure out _how_ they got such good info, not when they drank and slept their way through half the city.

She reluctantly slotted out the twins. She'd have to corner them on the ship instead.

Her older brother was out. He didn't hate the politics and intrigue as much as he simply ignored it. He would be practicing his swordsmanship for whatever duels might — no, definitely will happen in the capital. Duels were an excellent way to remove rivals. They were supposed to be non-lethal but it was astonishing just how often “first blood” resulted in death. She felt a pang of anxiety that she'd not trained today, though perhaps she could chalk up this trip as a kind of training.

It didn't matter. She had her knives now; that more than made up for everything so long as nobody knew about them. She glanced over at Sheth; she felt the weight of her knife, still in hand. A quick flick of the wrist would remove any chance of discovery. No, no. She shook off the thought. What would she do with the body, leave it in the street? She couldn't drag it; the man was massive. Besides, it would be only a matter of time before the elites figured out where he was, an investigation would commence, and that would make discovery all but inevitable. She would have to find another opportunity to remove him.

Or... not at all. She ground her teeth as she realized she'd been contemplating her own guard's murder. Sheth was a good man; he was reliable, honest. He would keep it a secret.

Still, she should keep an eye on him. She carefully slid her knife back into her pocket, only to realize there was hole in her pants. Her dagger had ripped through her pants to reach her hand.

Her breath quickened and a smile reached her lips. Dangerous. Delightful. It tasted like power, like freedom.

She would only have a few hours before they left. Clarissa and Shia would seek her out, and the twins would still be in the city. The court would already be in the midst of politicking their way onto the ship, jockeying for position. Normally, that would include her, but she wasn't there. She would be behind. She would have to remedy that first thing.

Clarissa and Shia. Gods below, but she hated those two almost as much as they hated each other. Jaresh, though, was worth talking to. Her blood was pure, her family old, and her connections extensive, almost as good as Stasia's. But her information was expensive, and Stasia wasn't always certain she came out on top of those transactions. The Agate family was one of the few that needn't jockey for position, and should some tragedy somehow befall the Longsuns, Stasia had no doubt it would be an Agate who sat on the throne.

Stasia nodded to herself. She would visit Jaresh first, assuming she could avoid Clarissa.

"We should part ways now, unless you intend to walk through the spires dressed like that?"

The sun was failing, falling into the horizon. They walked against the flow of people, and Sheth was getting odd looks for his attire. They'd long left the maze, and yet the feeling of being lost only intensified. The spires were easy to see as they twisted their way into the sky, only an hour’s walk.

She fingered her new knife, fingers unconsciously caressing the edges.

Stasia nodded, turned and walked toward the spires.

Yes, she would talk to Jaresh first. What had she to fear from a girl when she held a weapon of the gods?
