# 20 | Pirate [Roland & Sal]

The Pirate King's one mistake had caught up to him.

He knew this day would come, but he hadn't expected it to arrive so soon. Roland and his gang were the only ones willing to stand up to the evil Emperor; they were the only ones to protect the common folk from his army of undead soldiers— no, no, way too much... his mercenary army? No, not evil enough. His evil army; the army was evil. Meh, he'd come back to it later.

The pirates patrolled the coast, setting fire and plundering the Emperor's best ships, only to disappear into the mist with no trace. Did he keep these treasures for himself? No, he gave them to common folk, earning their love and trust.

The Emperor called him a Pirate; the people called him King. He wore the name with pride.

He gave them everything he had, everything except one. It was only one thing he kept, but it proved to be his downfall.

For in their greatest ship he'd found the Emperor's greatest treasure: his daughter.

How was he to know she would fall in love with him?

How was that _his_ fault?

The Emperor sent the Hound, the most notorious of all bounty hunters, rumored to have lost not a single bounty. The man had been engaged to the Emperor's daughter, having won her hand by some great feat of accomplishment. For him, the bounty was personal, and that meant the great Pirate King Roland couldn't simply run away.

Sal was right, it really did make a good story.

The Pirate King ran for his life in cursed woods, far from his beloved ocean. Every branch reached out to entangle him, roots rose to trip him, logs appeared to block him. Everywhere he moved, he felt constrained, restricted, and stymied. He longed for the open ocean, the freedom of ship, tide, and water. But to have that freedom, he must first lose the Hound.

He ducked, dodged, and sped through the forest until he spotted a thick bush conveniently located next to the path; a perfect place for an ambush.

The bush fought him, but he won after breaking off a few pieces. He pushed himself in as deep as he could and replaced the broken branches in a way he was sure wouldn't be noticeable.

He stilled himself when he heard a rustle, then the crunch of a foot slowly pressing into the forest floor. Silence followed. He couldn't see the Hound, but he was certain the fool hunter was right in from him. Roland prepared to spring his ambush.

Roland jumped as the hound crashed through the bush from the wrong direction. He did not yelp. No, he released a manly war cry, perhaps only an octave higher than normal.

Roland clawed his way out of the bush, barely ahead of the hound, who was having his own struggle with the foul bush. Roland stumbled out and turned to end the man's life, but the hound was already free.

"Yield knave!"

The Pirate King gasped at the insult. "Knave? Knave! Do you not know who I am?"

"You are but a petty thief and the liar who's stolen my love through the vilest witchery. Yield now, and perhaps I shall not cut off your fingers!"

"Never! You shall rue the day you crossed swords with the Pirate King!"

"Ugh... swords again?"

"Huh?"

"Never mind... fine! Have it your way, knave. I shall remove your fingers then, and they'll know you only as the fingerless pirate!" The Hound bellowed out a malicious crackle.

Roland lunged at the hunter, but the Hound parried the attack with skill. The two engaged in an epic clash of talent, yet Roland knew he was the better of the two, and it was a matter of time before the inevitable. He managed to get beyond the guard of the Hound and sent the man's weapon flying into the forest.

"Ow... stop hitting my hands!"

"Aha... and now it is you who must yield to me!"

The Hound scowled. "Never shall I yield to such as depraved, evil, scumbag of a lowly reprobate. Never shall I sully my honor with such a charlatan of evil. Instead, you shall know my wrath, and I will dance on your fingerless corpse!"

Roland blinked. He had no idea what several of those words meant. "Wow that... that was... uh, really descriptive."

The Hound glared.

"Fine, you shall have your reward."  Roland lunged at the Hound.

Somehow, the Hound side-stepped Roland's attack, deftly removed something from his pocket, and struck Roland in the gut with it. Roland gasped, looking down in surprise to see a knife protruding from his stomach.

He looked down on the blade in disbelief. "What trickery is this?"

"Nothing but what you deserve."

The great Pirate King Roland felt his life drain away. He staggered, gasped, and reached, but found no help. As his strength left him, he fell dramatically to his knees and gasped... for real.

Roland shouted and grabbed his knee with both hands.

"Uh... you ok?"

"Rock..."

Sal hissed in with his teeth and gave Roland a sympathetic look.

Roland shifted to reveal a stone partly covered in mud. He rubbed his knee for a minute, then pushed himself up and tentatively placed weight on the leg.

"So, you good?" Sal looked nervous. It would take forever to get home if Roland couldn't walk and the sun was already diving toward the horizon.

Roland pulled up his pants to reveal an angry red mark on his knee. He shrugged and dropped his pant leg.

"It's fine."

He clenched his teeth and limped in the direction of their glade. Sal followed a step behind Roland and allowed him to push first through the thicket.

"So, what do you think— ow!"

"Sorry!"

Roland flashed a grin at Sal, who disentangled himself from the branch Roland had just released. Sal gave him an irritable look.

"Why do you think the Royal is here?"

Roland shrugged. "You heard my dad, something about logging rights."

"Yeah but, doesn't it seem different?"

"Different?"

"Yeah. Last time there were others."

"Others?" Roland stopped and turned back to Sal. "What are you talking about?"

"Other people, other than the soldiers."

Roland jerked back in thought, then chewed on his cheek for a moment. Finally, he shrugged.

"Yeah, I guess." He turned and kept walking.

"You didn't notice?"

"Geeze Sal, I don't know. I guess I was too busy saving your butt."

"My butt was fine."

"Didn't seem like it from where I was standing," Roland muttered to himself.

A distant tinkling reached Roland's ears and gave him an idea. He altered his direction toward a nearby stream that ran this side of their glade.

He pulled off his shoes at the stream, tugged off his shirt, and immersed them both in the water. He watched the runnels of mud flow downstream and disappear. Once they were clean, he placed them in the sun on a nearby rock to dry. He sat down in the middle of the stream in his undershorts and sighed in relief as the cold water eased his throbbing knee.

Having watched Roland with a curious expression, Sal shrugged, pulled off his own shoes, and sat on a rock by the shore, leaving his feet to dangle in the water. His clothes — or, well, Roland's cloths on him — lacked both mud and stains, which was absurd; getting muddy was half the fun of playing.

"I'm leaving tomorrow," Sal said.

Roland grunted out a laugh. "No, you're not."

Sal put up an affronted look. "I am."

"Not."

"Listen Roland, I'm serious—"

"What are you going to do, Sal, run off with the soldiers?"

Sal's shocked expression all but confirmed it. Roland shook his head and picked through the water for rocks.

"You're eleven, Sal—"

"I'm almost twelve!"

"Fine, whatever, still... they're not going to take a twelve year old boy from nowhere."

He picked out a rock, threw it downstream, and felt a small satisfaction at the splash. He repeated this several more times before it lost its appeal.

"Nobody leaves Larstead... ever."

Which was true. Roland scowled, picked up another rock, and threw it hard; it clacked against the shore.

Nobody left Larstead. Sure, kids talked about going off on adventure, visiting massive cities, doing... stuff — anything other, any _place_ other than here — but nobody did. Here was boring, but here was fine; here was family; here was stable. Why leave?

Kids tried of course, kids older than Roland. Every couple years, one would run away. But Edensville was too far for anything but the most prepared runaway, which none of them were. They all came back.

"Tomorrow morning," Sal said.

"Uh huh."

Adults could go, but adults didn't go. By the time a child became an adult, they'd already been consumed by the town, by responsibility, by _marriage_. Roland shuddered; no greater chains than that. They'd probably have a child of their own, and they'd be given a house and a job to pay it off.

This town consumed people and buried them within a distant fold of time, out of sight and forgotten by the people of the Empire. Only one thin thread tied them to the world, old man Answan, who guided the drajin once a month to Edensville, relieving the town of the fruits of their hard labor and rewarding them with food, staples and, most importantly, news.

It was, reportedly, impossible to hide on his sled. The only way out was—

Roland looked up suddenly. "You asked already?"

Sal nodded, but he kept his eyes on the stream.

"Well?"

"Tomorrow morning." Sal said the words slowly, as though trying to understand.

"Sal!" Roland snapped his fingers at his friend.

"What!?"

Roland pushed his brow as high as it could go.

Sal huffed. "He asked if I wanted to be a soldier. I said yes. He said to meet him tomorrow morning."

Roland ran the words through his head. His eyes narrowed.

"So, he didn't actually say—"

"I know."

"And your father would loose his ever loving sh—"

"I _know_."

"Then why would he—"

"I..." Sal huffed again, then spoke quietly, "don't know."

The sun touched the horizon, its light deepening into oranges cast in shallow angles. They would need to leave soon to make it back before dark, but the thought refused to take hold. Roland found another rock and threw it without much enthusiasm.

"What about Laurice?"

Sal looked up, surprise on his face.

"Ha! You didn't think of her, did you?"

Roland was being mean, but sometimes anger was the best way to snap his friend out of it. Yet, instead of righteous outrage, Sal's shoulders dropped further.

Roland pressed his lips together, winced at the pain, then tongued his stitches while he thought.

"We could... go together."

That earned a sniggering laugh. "You... a soldier?"

"What? Gods, no! I meant we could run away together."

Sals pressed his lips into a smile. "Oh right, of course. We could steal the old man's drajin — I'm sure he won't mind — load it with supplies, make it to Edensville, and... Oh! I know, we'll become adventurers! We'll go raid some old ruins, find some relics, become famous— do you smell that?"

Roland sniffed a little, then shrugged. "No."

"I think it's smoke."

"So?"

Sal frowned, looking pensive. "Maybe we should go back. It's getting late and I need to get my clothes from your mom."

Roland glared at the sun, already halfway through the horizon; it always seemed to move too fast. He got up and carefully picked his way across the stream to his clothes.

He donned his boots and stomped a few time to try to get the water out. His shirt was reasonably dry, though there were still stains. He shrugged it on.

They worked their way upstream until they found a log that had long ago fallen, giving them a convenient bridge to walk across. The stream was shallow but Sal wouldn't get his boots wet. The crossing was tricky with the wind, which had picked up. Sal made Roland go first, a wise move given he'd fantasized about pushing his friend off the log. Just didn't seem right he was the only one with squishy boots.

The sun had dropped below the horizon and taken much of the light with it. Roland stopped to study the sky, which was streaked with oranges that cut off toward the north by angry dark clouds. They flashed ominously. He grew uneasy as he watched the clouds eat dusk's light.

They picked up their pace.

The wind whipped about dangerously when they reached the glade. A distant crack signaled some tree's last stand against the gale, and yet it was barely audible over thunder that echoed across the valley.

Despite this, Roland stopped to stare at the Whitewood. Though its leaves whipped about in the wind, the tree itself didn't move at all.

Roland knew it could sway. He'd seen it once when all the world was still. He'd felt something indescribable as he watched it dance to a tune no one but it could hear. It and him, for he'd felt then as though his whole world had swayed with the tree. And no matter how he tried to describe it, he only ever got a concerned look from Sal.

Now it moved not at all, not even the slightest sway, and it felt more real to him than anything else at that moment. Before it, the wind seemed to fade away, an inconsequential wailing of some toddler who could not get its way. Roland felt a twinge of envy as though he might be so anchored, so immutable.

"You ok?"

He blinked and turned to Sal. "It doesn't move."

"They never do."

Roland shook off his reverie and walked across the clearing. About halfway he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air. The wind had picked up from the North, but occasionally it shifted, and with that shift, he detected something new.

"Smoke?" he said into the wind.

Sal shifted on his feet, looking nervous. Most of the homes had fireplaces, but they weren't necessary; also, it was summer.

Sal walked by Roland and picked up his pace toward a small, beaten path opposite the clearing, worn down by the boy's traffic over the years. Roland followed as a tiny seed of angst took root. He could only imagine how his parents would react if he came home after dark in the middle of a storm. Nothing about that sounded pleasant.

The light fled as they journeyed deeper into the forest. They tripped over forgotten roots and rocks in the dark, fueling their anxiety. Roland passed Sal, and kept increasing their pace as his anxiety built.

He stopped suddenly and flung his hand out to Sal in warning. "Something's wrong."

The wind shifted and whipped about. The light was almost gone, but he refused to move. He caught more whiffs of smoke, but now heard something he couldn't identify. It bothered him. He stood there for several minutes as the wind thrashed his hair. He was about to give up when he heard the sound again.

The wind shifted and with it went the sound, but Roland was sure now of what he heard. He ran.

"Wait!" Sal sprinted to catch up.

"We've gotta get back," Roland yelled between breaths.

"What's wrong?"

But instead of answering, Roland picked up his pace. Sal ran hard to keep up with his friend's longer legs but stumbled. Roland flung out his arm and caught Sal before he tumbled, then pulled at him to keep going as Sal struggled to regain his feet.

"Come on, Roland! Wai—'

Sal was suddenly yanked from Roland's hand and disappeared. Roland skidded to a stop.

"Sal? Sal!"

Lightening lit up patches of the forest through the canopy. It was too much light, and left him blind from the flash. He scanned the darkness but could find no sign of Sal. He ran back up the path until he was certain he'd backtracked far enough. He chocked his fear back down his throat and walked the path slowly, scanning it for any sign of Sal.

"Sal! Please, Sal!"

Only the wind replied, and that coal in his stomach flared. A steep drop off on one side dropped down into a gully. It was the side Sal had been on.

Another flash of lightening almost blinded him— the storm was so close now— but he'd seen enough. A disturbed path of leaves and branches led down. It would be perilous to go down— no, _climb down_; It was too steep for anything else.

He gazed down the path toward town, toward where he'd heard the scream. He had to get back; he _needed_ to get home.

He gasped out a cry and squeezed his eyes shut. He took a deep breath and held it until his panic and fear gave way to a light-headed dizziness. He let it out in an explosive breath, turned, and stared down the incline.

Before he could doubt himself, he scrambled down. Almost immediately he began to slide. He flipped over and clawed at the dirt, trying to slow his descent. He slid right past Sal, who lay against a small Whitewood at an unnatural angle.

Roland scratched at the dirt but the incline increased, drawing him down faster. He reached out for the Whitewood, desperate. His motion began to slow until he stopped a dozen paces below the Whitewood, flat against the ground and afraid any motion might cause him to slide again.

Tears pressed at his eyes; he pressed them back. Carefully, he reached up and slowly pulled himself up. Little by little, he shimmied closer to Sal and the Whitewood. Sal's head lay back, his neck bent, but at this angle he couldn't tell if it was broken. He prayed to any god that might listen for Sal to be alive. He had to be. Anything else was... impossible.

"Sal!" he screamed as he got closer. "Please Sal, wake up!"

Sal didn't move.

Roland got in reach of the Whitewood and pulled himself up. He had no idea what to do, so he pushed Sal, then shook him, but there was no response, not even a twitch. His head was at a wrong angle, so he reached back to pull it up. Between his fingers he felt hair sticky and wet.

"Oh no. No. no no no no..."

He pressed his head against Sal's chest and listened. The wind was too loud, and thunder echoed through the mountains. As it faded, he thought he felt a faint flutter. He couldn't be sure, but he couldn't accept that Sal was dead. His mind simply couldn't swallow the idea.

"Okay, Sal. It's okay. Just... just wait here? Okay? Just wait here. I'll get help, I promise. Just..." Tears ran down his face; he struggled to breath. "Please, be okay? Okay, I'll get help, I promise, I'm sorry... I... I..."

He shook his head. He was light headed. He needed to get home. He needed to get help, but he couldn't just leave Sal like this.

As carefully as he could manage, he shifted Sal's body and propped it up against the tree. Sal's head lolled to the side, almost like he was sleeping.

He was sleeping; he would be okay. Roland closed his eyes and took deep breath. It would be okay. He just needed to get home and get help and everything would be okay. His dad would know what to do. He just needed to get home.

He reached up and slowly worked his way back up to the path. The leaves and dirt churned beneath him, refusing any solid purchase. He clawed at it, refusing to slide back down, forcing himself up, refusing to look back at Sal. He just needed to get help.

He reached the path and sprinted down it as fast as he could. His fingers felt sticky, and the echoes of a dying scream lingered in his mind. It had come from town but it suddenly sounded just like Sal's voice, screaming, dying.

He pushed himself harder and harder until his body outpaced his legs and he stumbled.

That coal of fear in his stomach flared into anger. Pressure built in his mind and as he felt himself fall, he felt something else. The Whiteoods gained substance, as though they'd somehow become more solid. They called to him, singing a song he could barely perceive. He reached out, feeling their solidity ahead of him, an anchor upon which he could always depend. He _pulled_ on that feeling.

Roland was yanked into the air, up into the tree tops and, for a long, incredible moment, he flew.

He threw up his arm as tree branches whipped and clawed at  him. Moments later they were gone, and his stomach floated up into his throat.

He hit the ground hard and became little more than a rolling ball of tangled limbs and bruises. He smacked against a tree, which drove the breath from his lungs. A loud ringing filled his ears.

His breath came back to him slowly and in small spurts. He couldn't tell if he'd broken himself— every part of his body hurt. He lay there trying to understand what happened, waiting until his breath came back in full before attempting any motion.

Sound pushed through his pain. He could barely hear the distinctive thwamps of lances, the yells of men, and screams. He had flown an incredible distance — *flown* — but the thought refused to take seed. It was drowned out by the distant sounds of death.

He was on his feet before thought could register it and only in retrospect realize he hadn't broken anything. He tore through the forest at in incredible pace; he _pulled_ and flew, guided by instinct born from fear and, beneath that, a seed of anger.

He saw a warm glow from the forest edge as he approached. It might have been pretty if not for the dread flaring in his chest.

He broke through the tree line and recoiled in horror.
