# 34 | Salvation [Sal]

"Is it alive?"

"He, moron, it's a he."

"Barely."

"What do you mean, barely? How can someone barely be a he?"

"Looks more like a scarecrow, a small one."

"You're an idiot. You know that?"

"Sir yes sir, I do."

A sound of disgust followed. Slim fingers lightly touched his neck.

"Well, he's alive, but only barely. That's—"

"So how's it barely alive? Either you are or you ain't."

"I really hate you."

"Sir yes sir."

"Please stop doing that."

"You're my commanding officer."

"I got promoted two days ago, and stop calling me sir."

"My point exactly, sir."

Silence followed.

"You're carrying him."

"Nope. No can do. It looks sick, sir. I ain't carrying nothing that might get me sick."

"I'm your commanding officer. You do what I say."

"All authority has limits, sir. You can't order me to kill myself."

A pause. "I kinda can, actually."

"Nope, you can't. Check the manual."

"Wait, you read the manual?"

"Of course... you didn't?"

"No, I did not. No one actually reads that thing, it's huge. Besides, that's what boot camp is for."

"How'd you get promoted if you didn't read the manual?"

"Competence."

"Oh, huh... the manual doesn't mention that."

"Gods, you really are an idiot."

"Sir yes sir. So, uh, you gonna carry the plague child?"

She let out a frustrated sigh. "Yes, I suppose I will."

Sal woke up slowly. He floated on a sea of warmth; it washed away the fragments of a dream of another life, but he could still smell ash.

He opened his eyes to see the roof of a tent that flapped lightly in a breeze. He noticed the water skin next and his mouth, pasty and bitter, tried to water at the thought of something to drink. But this skin hung high on a pole, and from the bottom ran a long, black, slick looking rope. Sal had never seen anything like it before. He spent seven seconds trying to figure out what it was. It was only when he traced it back to his arm that he became concerned.

"Good, you're awake. Very good."

Sal turned to see a man standing by his bed— no, cot. Fabric stretch across two poles. He'd heard about them from his father. The man was unfamiliar, with black hair and angular eyes. He must be from one of the other provinces. Not unheard of, but rare.

"Where am I?"

"You are a very lucky boy."

"My town was wiped off the earth by the hand of a god."

The man stared at him in surprise, opened his mouth, then turned and walked out. Sal had to admit it was a satisfying response, though he was almost as surprised by his words. He wasn't usually so open to strangers.

"The plague boy wakes."

Sal stretched his neck back to see a very large man standing behind him.

"Plague boy?"

"Yep. You survived the plague, thus the name."

"I don't think that—"

"Naw, just take it. It's a good name. Not many get names like that. You should feel honored. At least you lived."

Sal recognized the voice. "Barely."

The man snorted. "Awake for that, huh?"

Sal relaxed his neck to stare at the tent ceiling. "Barely," he whispered.

"Like I said. It's a good name."

"Where am I?"

"Camp."

"...okay. Why are you here?"

"I'm a soldier. Soldiers spend a lot of time in camps."

"No, I mean here, in this tent."

"Ah that," he grunted amusement, "revenge."

"Revenge," Sal said the word slowly.

"Yeah. Happens a lot in the army. You'd think revenge would be more exciting but nope, it's not. Mostly just sitting... in a tent... for days."

Sal suddenly remembered the black rope. He looked at it closely and realized it didn't actually go into his arm. Instead, it appeared glued to some a small, thin, metal stalk. That _did_ go into his arm. He reached for it.

"Naw, wouldn't do that."

He stretched his neck again and felt his head throb from the effort. "What is it?"

"I look like a doctor?"

Sal glanced back at the black rope, which wasn't really a rope. "But what does it do?"

The man shrugged. "The doc put it in; you'd be stupid to take it out."

Sal looked again at the rope. It was good advice. He'd almost been dead and whatever the doc did, he lived. That was worth a little trust at least.

"What happened to the other one?" Sal said.

"Renee?"

"The one who carried me."

The man snorted again. "She lived. Then she got revenge."

Sal opened his mouth but at that moment several people walked in.

The first to enter was shorter, though not nearly as short as Sal. He had brown skin, a shade darker than Sals and close cropped hair. He was dressed in a sharp uniform and carried an aura of authority.

Beside him walked a thinner man, light skin, though not quite so light as the people of Larstead. He had long dark brown hair pulled back, arms behind his back, spectacles on his face.

Another was the doctor, and the fourth was a woman in dusty military fatigues patterned in shades of brown that, oddly, seemed to accent her skin.

"This the boy?" the man with authority asked.

"Yes sir, found him in the road."

Sal recognized the voice and turned his head. "Renee?"

"Yes?" She looked confused. "Do you know me?"

"Thank you for carrying me," he paused, "even if I did have the plague."

She looked surprised, spared a suspicious glance at the large man, then looked back to the one in authority.

"Right well, son, my name is Anj. I'd very much like to hear your story."

Sal looked over and stared at Anj a moment. "I walked."

Anj waited, but Sal's head felt muddy and he couldn't really think of any more words.

"Yes, and that's all good. But we can't figure out where you walked from."

"It doesn't matter, it's gone."

Anj looked annoyed, but reigned in his irritation. "It does matter—"

"Sir," the doctor said, "he's still under quite a few meds."

The man's expression softened immediately, then he knelt to bring himself eye level to Sal. "I'm sorry son, I know this must be confusing. But if you could tell us anything you know, it would help us a lot."

Sal looked at Sanj and tried to gather his thoughts. "I'm from Larstead."

Anj looked thoughtful.

"I believe that's a small logging town deep in the footholds," the skinny man offered.

Sal nodded. Now that the doctor pointed it out, he noticed his thoughts were slower than usual, more disorganized. He was also quite a bit more relaxed than he could ever recall feeling.

"So you walked. Were you traveling, then, with family maybe?"

"Bandits?" Renee said, though her tone suggested it was improbable.

"Would explain the injuries," the doctor said.

Anj shook his head. "What, so bandits are robbing shipments of wood now?"

"Not bandits," Sal said.

They turned back to him.

"Larstead." His thoughts really were scattered.

"I think he means he walked from Larstead," the big man said.

Renee snorted. "I doubt that."

Anj looked back at the thin man. "Larstead is how far?"

"Close to a week and half."

"Scouts might make it in a week," Renee said, "five days if they really pushed themselves."

Sal frowned. He only recalled four days, but he was feverish toward the end. Still, it bothered him to loose track of time like that.

Anj turned back to Sal. "Say this is true. Why would you walk all the way from Larstead?"

Sal stared at him. "Because it was gone."

Anj scowled, pushed himself back on his heels, and rose. "I think maybe we should have this conversation after he's recovered a bit."

"No wait! It's... we were out in the woods."

"We?"

"My friend, Roland. We were out...umm," his head refused to put thoughts together, "exploring. We were out late because of the Royal, and we smelled smoked—"

Anj raised his hand. "Hold on. A Royal was in Larstead?"

The other exchanged confused glances. The large man especially seemed concerned.

"Yeah."

"Does this happen often?"

"Every few years, I think, but this one was different."

Anj looked like Roland had told him dragons were real.

"I don't think the boy is lying," the big man said as he scratched his armpit. "I mean, what would be the point?"

Anj looked up at the man, narrowed his eyes, and turned back to Sal. "So you smelled smoke?"

"Yeah. But there was a storm, and it was late. We were scared because the storm was coming fast, and we shouldn't smell smoke. Then Roland heard something, I think, and he started running. I ran after him, but I tripped and fell... and then... I uh... think I must have hit my head."

"Would also explain his wounds," the doctor said.

Anj looked thoughtful for a few seconds, then turned back to Sal. "So you hit your head. Your friend must have gone to get help?"

"I don't know. I mean yes, he would. But.. umm, when I woke up the next morning everything was gone."

"Gone?"

Sal took a deep breath and tried to bring his thoughts back into focus. He felt surprisingly talkative, but the words weren't coming out right. He did, however, feel very good. He decided to just let the words flow. They were going to anyway.

"It's... I woke up and the world was all dust— no, _ash_. It was all ash. I climbed out of a ravine and everything was just... just gone. Only the Whitewoods weren't, but everything else was gone. And I climbed out, and... and the town. It was... the town... there was nothing..."

The big man shouldered Anj aside and placed his hand on Sal's shoulder. Anj stood and took a step back to make room. Renee looked confused as her eyes shifted from Anj to the big man and back again.

"Not much about that story makes sense," Anj said to the skinny man.

He nodded in return. "I'll check the records, but I can't see why a Royal would go so far out."

Anj nodded. "I doubt any Royal knows the town exists."

"Hey," the big man squeezed Sal's shoulder, "you'll be okay. I know it's tough, but can you answer one more question for me?"

Anj turned to the man. "Rinley?"

"Hold on, I wanna see something."

Rinley reached under the cot, pulled out a square piece of cloth, and handed it to Sal. Sal stared at it for a few moments in confusion before he realized his face was wet. He quickly wiped at the water on his cheeks.

"So, you said the Whitewoods were still there."

Sal nodded.

"Can you describe them to me? Why do you call it a Whitewood?"

Sal frowned at the odd question. "It's ah... the bark is white."

Rinley nodded. "Right, but Birch is white too."

Sal shook his head, then had to blink a couple time as the world wavered. "Not like this. Whitewoods are really white... like bone."

"_Bone_... right okay, what about the leaves?"

"They're green?"

"What about in Winter?"

"They turn red in the Winter."

Rinley's eyebrows flew up. "Anything else?"

"There's a rhyme." Sal frowned and nodded rhythmically as he pulled the memory up. "Blooded in Winter, verdant in Spring, bleached bones in between." He looked back up. "Roland's parents don't like us playing around them."

"Why?"

"They're dangerous. The branches don't bend at all."

"And these trees, they're common?"

"Uh sure. I mean, not a lot... but, I guess they're like any other tree."

Rinley stood, eyes darting, as a broad smile lit up his face. "Fuuuuck..."

Everyone stared at him. When Rinley noticed, he looked around with raised eyebrows. "You don't see it?"

"I am thoroughly confused," Renee said, she glanced at Anj, "on multiple levels."

"Somebody found themselves a golden goose."

"A what?" Anj said, annoyed.

"It's a northern story," the skinny man said, "about a goose that lays golden eggs."

"Uh huh, and you know what you do with one? You make damn sure it's happy." Rinley turned back to Sal. "Your town have running water?"

Sal nodded. "All the main buildings, and the richer homes."

"And gravtech? You have stoves, heating, lights?"

Sal nodded, as confused as Renee appeared to be.

"That's... a lot of tech for a small town," Anj said.

Rinley turned to him. "I bet a Royal did visit every few years, just to make sure everyone there was happy and word hadn't gotten out."

"Word?"

Rinley grinned. "Yep. Word that he'd found a source of Elderin."

"Fuck." Anj took a step back.

The skinny man looked as though he swallowed something sour.

Renee stared at Rinley. "Wait. It's illegal to even look at one of those trees. Only the Royals grow them behind big-ass walls."

Rinley shrugged.

"So how the fuck do you know what one looks like?" She looked at Rinley, then back at Anj, who also shrugged. Renee's face soured. "No. I'll eat my boot if you're a—"

"Wouldn't make that bet if I were you."

She gave Anj a pleading gaze, but the man simply nodded.

"But he's a grunt. Royals don't buy grunt positions in the army. They buy positions like captain, commander, general—"

"Naw, a Royal can't purchase General. That one you have to earn."

She stared at Rinley in horror, who returned a teethy smile. "It's in the manual."

Anj held a hand up. "We're getting off track. Rin, your theory lends the boy credence. That means somehow, his town was wiped off the map by only the gods know what. We'll need to send a few scouts—"

"We'll go," Rinley shot Renee an evil look. She looked confused until Anj nodded his agreement. Then she looked horrified.

"Agreed."

"I don't know who's in charge anymore," Renee mumbled.

"Oh no, I'm just a grunt. You the boss lady."

"...fuck."

Rinley's smile grew wider.

Anj turned to Renee. "Get everything together. You're to leave within the hour." He turned to the skinny man. "Ishaan, release enough provisions for... hmm, at least two weeks to be safe."

Ishaan and Renee turned to leave.

"Don't say nothin," Rinley said, his lips pressed into a smirk.

Renee turned back to Rinley in a daze. Her eyes narrowed. "You're still a buffoon."

"It's why I like you."

She rolled her eyes and left.

"I want to join," Sal blurted out. He'd been dazing a little under a warm feeling.

Anj and Rinley turned to him.

"Join what?"

"I want to be a soldier."

Anj shook his head and smiled. "You're too young."

"I'm thirteen," Sal lied.

"He walked all the way from Larstead without water," Rinley said. "Don't know many soldiers could do that. Besides, you know what the Empire does to orphans. Seems like a waste."

"He's still too young—"

"Not if he has a sponsor."

Anj looked surprised. "Okay, so that's a lot of money."

"Like I said, takes someone special to survive like that."

"Not sure it's much better. I heard the survival rate was half."

"Naw it's not—" Rin cocked his head, "actually, that's probably right. Not quite the same though, a lot of those deaths come from rivalries, and the army has a vested interest in allowing them. The boy here keeps his head down and he'll get through just fine."

Anj turned to Sal. "You can read and write?"

Sal nodded. "And math, literature, government, history, a few runes—"

Rin whistled a tune. "That Royal really wanted them happy."

Anj looked confused. "Runes? I thought that was forbidden."

"They are, but you need 'em to do anything with Elderin." Rin turned Sal. "You best keep this to yourself if you want to keep on living. Runes, those Whitewoods? Never mention them again."

Sal nodded. Though he didn't understand much of what Rin said, he did want to keep living.

"You understand it'll be very hard," Anj said to Sal. "A sponsorship means you'll be trained with the Royals and they can be…" he glanced at Rin, "vicious."

Rin shrugged. "You've got the right of it."

"Think you can handle it?"

Sal nodded to Anj, and the world seem to waver.

Anj shrugged and looked at Rin. "It's your right, and your money. I'll have Ishaan draw up the papers." He turned to Sal. "Welcome to the provincial army, son."

He turned and walked out.

A wash of warmth swept over Sal and threatened to drag him into oblivion. He looked over to see the doctor fiddling with the water skin. He started when a large hand pressed into his shoulder.

"You did good, plague boy. I look forward to seeing how you perform."

Sal opened his mouth to reply but another wave of warmth washed over him and all he got out was half a moan.

"Yeah, good stuff that. Get some sleep. You're gonna need it."
