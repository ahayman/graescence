# 71 | Conclusions

Ellie’s face smoothed into nothing, as though she’d vacated her own body and left nothing but autonomic responses in her place. He recalled what it had been like, unable to connect his thoughts to actions, a prisoner in his own body, unable to care, but seeing it on her discomfited him on an instinctual level. He’d never really thought about how precious his own mind was until he saw it removed from someone else, how vulnerable someone who didn't care could be.

He shook off the thought and walked her to the closet. She followed without any resistance or will, and as soon as they approached the close, its door slid open. He grabbed caps, long-coats, and because he was there, riffled through the drawers. There were thin leather gloves inside and nothing else, which he found mildly disappointing. He grabbed all that he could carry, awkwardly tucked them under one arm, and pulled Ellie back into the other room as quickly as he could.

“Oh gods… I can’t do this anymore,” she said as soon they entered the room. “My mind feels like it’s a rag doll stitched together too many times.”

“I think you won’t have to,” he muttered.

He laid out everything he gathered on the table and then quickly donned the larger of the coats. It was stiff in sections, as though someone had sewn sticks into them. The caps were just odd, clearly gravtech, with dozens of finely curved gravwood filaments in them. The back of the cap extended down over the coat. He donned a cap but nothing happened.

Ellie groaned at the look on his face. “All that for nothing.”

“Don’t give up just yet.”

“Sorry… this place is getting to me.”

“I know, but if its gravtech then I probably need to feed it.”

But nothing worked. There was no place to feed it energy, or at least nothing that Roland could discern. Eventually, he realized there were more pieces and so looked over the gloves next. These also had gravwood filaments embedded along the top of the glove. He donned them, and fed them energy, though he had to do it through the top of his hands, which felt weird.

The jacket sleeve immediately snapped to the glove, but aside from that did nothing else. It was progress at least. It took him a while to realize the back of the cap needed to be under the coat to work. Once he figured that out, a very weak shield snapped around him and he collapsed to his knees.

“Are you okay?”

He held out a hand while he fought off waves of dizziness and fatigue. At the same time, he felt remarkably better, or at least more himself, but it was clear he hadn’t slept in quite some time. After collecting himself, he pushed to his feet and turned to Ellie.

“It works, but I think we haven’t slept in a long time. Just… realize that.”

“Fine, and you look ridiculous.” She brushed by him and donned a smaller coat. “Let’s just get this over with.”  A few more seconds and she’d donned everything. She actually took a moment to glare at him, then a shield snapped out around her. She staggered and slowly tried to blink away the exhaustion. “Oh gods…”

Both shields were so weak they’d barely slow a light breeze, but they were incredibly precise, wrapping around the contours of the body and even the fingers. Most importantly, they countered the room’s effect, though that was pretty much all they would do.

“Ready?” Roland said after Ellie recovered from the initial wave of exhaustion.

“Yes, please.”

She grabbed her pack, shouldered it, and headed straight for the door. Roland followed close behind, but as soon as they entered the apathy room, she headed for the exit while he headed for the table in the center. Ellie had almost made it to the door before she realized he wasn’t behind her. She turned as he began to inspect the items on the table.

“Are. you. kidding me?”

“Well, I never really got a chance to explore.”

“I cannot understand why you’d want to after all this.”

“But what do you think the room is for, and those chairs?” He gestured behind him with one hand while he picked up an intricate device in the other.

“I’m sure it’s nothing I want to know. Those chairs are… not good.”

He grunted out agreement but continued his inspection. Every device was complex to the point of absurdity, and just about every device was attached to the table— or, he corrected himself, perhaps they were all the same device. He looked closer and realized that was closer to the truth. The table itself was a device, an immense device of gravwood that connected to the chairs.

In truth, the only thing that wasn’t part of the table was the one device he’d already picked up, little smaller than his palm. It was shaped like a spherical, convex oval that tapered into points. From each end split dozens of gravwood filaments that twisted along the surface of the shape, split, and then dove into the center. There was no solid part of the object that he could see, just the endless twisting of filaments that split off into ever smaller pieces before they dove into the center.

“Are you done goggling the… whatever that is?”

He glanced up, then back over at the table. He was intensely curious, but there was little hope of figuring out what it was, even if he weren’t exhausted beyond reason.

“Yeah, let’s go find my pack.”  He pocketed the device and headed toward the door, only to hear that grating sound. He’d half hoped their new attire would disguise him, or at least do something to let him through the doors.

“Silly boy.”  Ellie giggled as she walked passed to him, and then through the door as it slid open. At least she was back to her normal, irritating self. It was more comforting than he’d like to admit.

The hallway was just as he remembered. An endless, slightly curved passage that appeared to go on forever. To the left he saw doors on both sides of the hallway, and as much as he wanted to explore he was far too tired to consider it. He headed right instead. His memory of the place was shattered, but he recalled enough to know which direction to go in. Also, there were foot prints in the accumulated dust, so his memory had a little help.

Each door would make that grating sound as they passed. It was annoying enough that he moved toward the outside of the hall, with Ellie closer to the door. Then the next door they passed opened.

Roland stopped and stared in surprise at first, then disappointment. It was just another hallway with doors lined on both sides.

“No,” Ellie said with a tone finality.

“I wasn’t going to.”

“Yes, you were.”

“But don’t you want to know where it leads?”

“No, definitely not.”

“Oh, come on, just a little?”

“Do you really want to get lost in here?”

He started at a thought and looked around. It was a good question. How did they navigate this place? There were no markings anywhere and with everything looking the same, it seemed impossible to know where you were.

“You have that look again.”

“I have a look?”

“You have many.”

“Huh, and which one is this?”

“The one right before you do something stupid.”

He screwed up his face at her. “No, just thinking.”

“Mmm hmm. Like I said.”

He took a step forward and the door slammed shut. Well, there went that idea.

“Wow. Those doors really don’t like you.”  She sounded absurdly pleased.

“Ack, fine. Let’s just go.”

They continued to walk as he chewed on the problem of navigation. The place was clearly massive. Did they memorize the layout, count the doors? It was an absurd idea, yet he couldn’t think of anything else. Even with a map, they’d have to count doors to know where they were. What if they lost count? No, there had to be some way to distinguish the— oh, or maybe not. What if he wasn’t looking right? What if they were distinguished, just not in the way he’d expected.

He opened his senses and then stopped in astonishment. Before the next door was a very weak but extremely complex surface. As he approached, the door made the same grating sound, but another line of surfaces appeared below the others.

“Level Nine, Causeway F - Thermogravics, Access Denied.”

“Wha—“

“Use your senses… they’re words, I’m sure. The letters are weird and the words misspelled, but you can sound them out, sort of.”

Ellie suddenly looked surprised. “That’s—“

“Impossible?”

“No. Just very… improbable.”

“Hmmm… maybe your backwater village just didn’t have them.”

Ellie rolled her eyes and began walking down the hall. After a few more moments and a regretful glance back, he jogged and caught up. He now wondered what he’d have seen in the apathy room had he the wits to use his senses in there.

“They use surfaces to write letters,” he said after an appropriate time had passed, which might have been only a few seconds.

She nodded, then shook her head with an incredulous expression. “This place scares me.”

“Why? It’s incredible. The words must somehow be ingrained in the wood itself.”

“Yeah, but what happened to them? This kind of tech is… it’s nothing I’ve heard of. It’s old, and yet it still has power. Roland, it has rooms that destroy the mind. What kind if people make stuff like that? What would cause them to disappear?”

Roland stuck his hand in his pocket and fingered the device. After a few steps he kicked at the dust to send it up into a puff. “Whatever happened, it was a while ago.”

Her frown deepened. “And what if what destroyed them is still around?”

“No, the place isn’t damaged, there’s no people, no remains, just dust. It’s like they just left.”

She twisted her mouth but remained silent and then, without a word, walked off. He stared after her a moment while his thoughts spun. He was torn between the desire to keep exploring and an unease he’d that had begun to worm through his mind. Ellie said the place didn’t like him, didn’t want him here, but that didn’t set right with him. The longer he stayed, the more he felt as though she’d gotten it wrong. This place wasn’t designed to keep him out, but in. It was designed to make him confused, docile, and — if she was right about her cell — it was designed to keep him here, sedated, trapped.

He jogged to catch up, matched her pace, and they continued silently down the hall. After a little while, they found his pack laying in front of one of the doors. Around it the dust had been cleared away. It took him a while to realize what had happened.

“I think I assaulted this door.”

She let out a cross between a laugh and scoff. She didn’t stop walking but he did.

He’d kept his senses open, and read the shapes in floating in front of the door. “Level Nine, Causeway C - Micro, Lock down”

She turned back. “Lock down?”

“Maybe because I attacked it?”

“Barely.”

“I was having a bad— ohhh.”

“You know you interrupt yourself almost as much as you do me.”

“It’s a research ah… hmmm… lost the—“

“Facility?”

“Yeah, that.”

Her eyes brightened suddenly. “So, not a prison?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“Maybe the rooms were where the researchers slept?”

“Maybe,” but his stomach sank under a new thought that finally pulled together from his unease, “or maybe it’s where they kept those they did the research on.”

Ellie closed her eyes and groaned. “That’s worse.”

He nodded slowly, then picked up and shouldered his pack. Ellie walked away before he’d finished, forcing him to jog a few steps to catch up. She walked quickly, her brow furrowed, silent. His own spirit had dampened under the realizations piling up, and so he felt no more need to speak than she did.

As they walked, he kept an eye on the words floating in front of the doors as they passed. They all started with ‘Level 9’ and the causeway letters decreased sequentially, but most of the words after that made no sense to him.

They stopped when a door opened for them instead of flashing ‘Access Denied’ along with that noise he both hated and had stopped hearing.

“Incinerator/Waste Disposal.”  He focused on the hallway after reading, which had a much thicker layer of dust coating the floor. “That’s a lot of dust.”

She said nothing and after a moment he turned to her but stopped at the horror and tears on her face.

“Ellie, what’s wrong?”

She shook herself off with a loud sigh and tore her eyes from the hallway. “Please. Let’s just go.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Roland, we’ve seen no bones, no remains.”

“So?”

She turned back to the hallway. “Waste Disposal.”

He staggered back as his mind finally caught up to her words. All this time, and they’d been walking through the dust of the dead. He’d kicked that dust, breathed it. His desire to explore suddenly winked out and left him with nothing but a feeling of horror and exhaustion.

A sense of foreboding crystallized into thought. “Ellie, why did it open for me and not the others?”

She shook her head, jaw clenched.

“Okay,” he said quietly, “you were right. Let’s go.”

She closed her eyes. “Finally.”

She turned first, he followed right behind, and they both walked down the hall, careful not to disturb the dust anymore than they had to. Roland refused to open his senses, kept his eyes away from the doors, and stopped hearing whatever protest or invitation they cried out as he passed.

Maybe it was the exhaustion, but it felt like a long time before they found the crack they originally came in through. Beyond it, he saw their tracks fade into the horizon, with more heading back. How long has he wandered the halls? He was beyond exhausted, probably severely dehydrated, his mind slow and empty. His body felt airy and sluggish all at the same time.

As soon as they passed through the crack, Ellie ripped off the protective clothes and threw them back into the hall. She looked angry and disgusted. Roland had been so distracted by the dust, he hadn’t even considered they’d been wearing a dead people’s clothes. He removed them but let them lie where he dropped them. He no longer had the energy to feel much of anything.

They’d only walked a few paces before Ellie stopped him, took his hand, and in a quiet voice said, “I’m sorry about this.”

His eyes snapped out of a haze. “Wait, wha— agh”

For the second time in his life, reality twisted and compressed around him, and with it his mind. It was far worse than before. Ellie took the impossible and dragged it far beyond the conceivable. The worst part of it was that there was no escape. He tried to close his eyes but the twisted weights of reality wouldn’t allow his senses to close. They pulled at his mind and tried to unmake him.

Ellie yanked on his hand and dragged him through a twisting darkness that ended only in darkness.

He promptly threw up absolutely nothing, several times, paused for breath, then continued to convulse. His journey through the depths lasted mere seconds, but it would be at least half an hour before he could stop dry heaving. In a fit of irony, Ellie said absolutely nothing. He wasn’t sure whether he appreciated it or not. A comment or two might have broken the monotony of repeatedly evacuating nothing from his stomach.

“Gods but I hate that,” he said after finally rolling over onto his back. “Oh huh, it’s night.”

“You done already?”

“I can’t move, if that’s what you mean, and my stomach hurts, but I think I’m done throwing up.” Also the stars were blurry and twisted around themselves repeatedly.

“Of course your stomach hurts, silly boy. You’ve been throwing up for an hour.”

He smiled. At least she was feeling better. “I think I’m going to sleep here.”

“In the forest?”

“Yes.”

“Looking to feed the wildlife?”

“Only if I get a few minutes to sleep.”  He was certain he couldn't stand, but was less sure it was from the after effects of a twisted reality or the extreme exhaustion that assaulted him in waves.

She hummed a non-response and kept going until it became a melody in truth. It wasn’t a song he recognized but for the first time he realized just how good of a singer she was. She never faltered, never uttered a false note, not even slightly off, no matter that she must be just as tired as he was. It was even possible that she was making it up, creating notes from nothing to bring an ethereal beauty into the world that would last for only a moment, never to repeat. Without knowing where the song would go, he lost himself on the tide of notes, drifting in the moment as her voice carried him through currents and lulled his mind into peace.

He awoke to a patter of wet on his head, a deep cold in his bones, and a tingling in his leg. His eyes snapped open, then water forced him to blink away the blurriness that had assaulted his eyes. He groaned and sat up to see a black wet mess on his thigh.

The rain reminded him of how thirsty he was, so he leaned over to grab his pack and sucked down the remaining water from his flask, careful to let Ellie sleep. She groaned anyway, and pushed herself off his leg.

“It was stupid to sleep out here,” he said as she rubbed the water and sleep from her eyes.

“Too tired to make it home.”  She looked around a moment, then pulled down a matted section of her halo and scowled at it as though it had intentionally offended her.

“Hmmm... rain,” he said with a smile. No matter the disaster it had wrought on her hair, he was happy for it to wash away some of the death dust that had accumulated over the... actually, he had no idea how long they'd been down there.

She turned the scowl on him, but that only worked to deepen his smile.

He folded up his legs, and pulled his pack to him. The bag had fallen open last night and let the rain soak everything so that what remained of his food was little more than a swollen mess. He pulled out some of what used to be jerky.

“I wouldn’t—“

“Yeah, I know.”  He threw it out, dug through his pack for anything else, then threw that out as well. He’d have to wait for home to eat, which was disappointing. His night’s rest seemed to reignite his hunger with a vengeance.

Ellie had pulled her own rations out and was presently chewing on them while watching him with a raised eyebrow. She gestured an offering, to which he slowly shook his head. He was hungry but dried mushrooms... how was that even considered food?

The rain increased in intensity until it had begun to fall in sheets. Roland closed his eyes and lifted his face to relish the cleansing seep into his face. The sound of watery assault against the canopy above transformed into a quiet clap for the escape of a prison that had threatened with the death of a silenced mind. Here was antitheses of that place, sensation, and it crawled down his face, down his neck, down his back and chest. The sensation was life, and even as his face remained firmly lifted upward to the heavens in supplication, so did the salt of his eyes taint the purity that cascaded down his body.

In time the rain let off, then slowly faded as the sun broke up heaven’s offering. He lowered his face, finally, with no idea how much time had passed, and for once the loss of time presented itself as a gift, as peace itself.

Ellie had watched him, brows furrowed into a pinch, mouth a firm pressed line, eyes intense and searching, though for what he could never guess. They stared at each other, her an unmitigated mess, he a soul damaged and cleansed.

“All that rain, and you sit in a puddle of mud,” she said, breaking the silence.

He looked down and then snorted. She'd sat on a root while he remained in the mud, clean yet soaked in a brown sludge. He shrugged.

“So what now?” he said after a moment.

“I don't know.”

“Will you go... home?”

She fell silent, eyes lowered, shoulders dropped.

“You *still* want to go back,” he said after a time.

“It still feels like home.”

“It's a lie.”

“And that's all I have, though, isn't it?”

He had no idea how to respond to that. He wanted to comfort her, to tell her that no, truth was in reach. Yet he couldn't. He clung to his lies just as tightly as she did hers. Yet his mind would not accept that, or could not. He cast around for an answer, a way out.

“Your parents? Can't you go home, for real?”

She shook her head vigorously. “No, can’t.”

“But why not? I’m sure your parents miss you.”

“No, it’s not that. It’s... it’s complicated.”

What could be so complicated that she’d rather be alone? Some fallout between her and her parents? He tried to imagine some disagreement that would warrant such ostracism, but were his own parents still alive, there’d be precious little that could keep him from them.

“I don’t under—”

“Listen. I... it’s my brother. That’s why I can’t go home.”

“Oh, you have a fight?”  She has a brother?

“No. No, he died.”

“Oh... I ah, I’m sorry. I didn’t know.”

“Of course you didn’t, silly, I never told you.”

“Right, okay.” He hated himself for not having something better to say, but words had fled him under shock.

“He...” She took a deep breath to steady herself. “It was a bad death. I see it, every day, him... dying. I can’t go back there, I don’t... I don’t think...”

His mind spun for things to comfort her, something to make it better. Yet pain, no matter what its form, was simply the form of the world. And it was a form he understood, knew intimately, a form that required silence and patience.

“We were close, but he was always, I don’t know, too sensitive, too meek. Yet he anchored me, kept me... in the here, in the now. When he died, I lost my anchor and, I don’t know, I’ve been adrift, lost.”

“I’m sorry...” The words felt trivial.

“But I never realized how lost until you. I never realized how alone I’d been.”

He opened his mouth, but the words died on his tongue, none of them sufficient, leaving silence the only answer he could give her.

“And you? You'll go back to _her_?”  She didn't even try to hide her disgust.

His lips pinched, jaw clenched. “I have no choice.”

“You always have a choice! Always!”

“And what choice, to stay here in the woods forever? Locked away from the world, scared that at any moment I might destroy everything I love?”

“No, that's not—“

“I'm a *monster*, Ellie. And unless I learn—“

“You are *not*! I know monsters, I've met them. I remember them. I—“

“You remember what?” he snarled, “You barely know tomorrow from today, much less yesterday. Do you even know how long we were in the ruins? Were we there for days or years? Do you even know?”

He shouted the last of that to a panicked girl, who’s eyes had widened in fear and horror at truths she’d avoided for a time she could not perceive. But he couldn’t see that over the anger and fear that coursed through him.

“You. don’t. know,” he screamed. “You’re just a scared little girl hiding in the woods from a past you refuse to confront.”

The pain and hurt in her eyes drove him to his knees. “No, no, I didn’t mean—“

But she was gone. He barely even noticed the nausea of her passing, for anger had revealed itself as guilt, and that guilt washed over him more thoroughly than any rain ever could.

“I didn’t mean it,” he whispered, “it was... I didn’t mean it. Please, I’m sorry.”

But he’d already chased away his only friend in the world.
