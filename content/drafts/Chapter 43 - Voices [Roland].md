# 43 | Voices [Roland]

Roland woke, gasping for air. He'd been attacked by Jackrets, but they were on fire and they were... speaking? Taunting him? Already the dream faded.

He took a deep breath and held it, eyes closed, waiting for his heart to settle. He billowed his cheeks as he released it, then groaned and sat up. It was still dark, not yet morning, though a half-light from Ionia filtered through the window and cast the room in sharp angles of orange.

He pushed the sheets back, grimacing at the damp sheets, and slid off the bed. He scampered to the closet and pulled on a pair of thick trousers and a long-sleeved shirt.

He should probably take a bath. He considered it for half a second before his stomach grumbled and rearranged his priorities. He had at least a couple hours before Rose got up, which gave him plenty of time to explore. It had become something of a ritual whenever his nightmares woke him, which was often enough that Rose often found him in some odd end of the house or, more recently, trying to break in to one of the other buildings.

The first few times, he was sure she would beat him. Yet every time she caught him she would calmly and firmly explain that he was to never do again whatever it was he was doing at the time. Her tone never wavered, her face as calm as glass, yet he could practically taste the frustration coming off her. She was a woman accustomed to being obeyed without question and she didn't seem to know what to do with a boy who simply didn't.

He opened the door to the hall, leaving his hand on the handle to keep it depressed, and cracked it just enough for him to slip through. The only sound was a small click as he slowly released the door handle. He spared a quick glance to make sure Rose was still in her room.

He froze. There was no light under her door.

That was a problem; she was always up at this time. It was possible she was sleeping but he could never figured out when she slept. Her light was on every time he'd checked, except now. Perhaps she was sleeping, but his gut twisted; it just didn't feel right.

It was risky to explore now, probably too risky — he let out a quiet snort — but then what? Even if she did beat him, how would that be any different than his normal training? But no, she would just calmly reprimand him and he didn't understand why. It's not like she was afraid of hurting him — his body was covered in bruises — so why such a light hand at everything else?

He shook off the thought when his stomach growled yet again. He crept down the hallway to the top of the stairs, then waited and listened. He glanced back down the hall; her light was still off. He heard nothing more than he always had this time of morning, but it felt just a little more ominous now, as though she waited around the corner to jump out at him.

He let out a quiet snort. What a perfectly stupid thought that was. He couldn't even put an image to it.

He crept down the stairs, having to feel for the steps hidden in the dark, and again he waited. Nothing. She either wasn't down here or she was staying completely still. There was absolutely no reason for her to do that; it was just a stupid thought driven by a child's overactive imagination.

He grit his teeth and continued on into a kitchen barely lit by a single small window from which drifted the diffuse orange light of the moon. On the far wall was a narrow door. He padded over to it and lightly twisted the handle, which stopped abruptly. Locked, but he'd expected that.

That locked door had been the bane of his existence. It was practically the most important door in this whole cursed compound and he hadn't been able to figure out where she hid the damn key... or not until recently, anyway.

The third drawer down, center of the counter held all kinds of cooking utensils. All these drawers did; she had a ton of cooking utensils, most of which Roland could never name. He pulled the drawer out slowly, stopping once to carefully push down a flat ended tool that may have been a spatula except it was oddly curved. Once out, he reached further back, careful to disturb nothing until his fingers brushed a small piece of curved metal at the very back. He grinned, pulled the piece into hand, and wove it back out.

Finally.

He rushed to the door, inserted the key, and twisted until it clicked. He could barely contain his excitement, but he forced it down. Now was not the time to be sloppy. He slowly leveraged the handle, pulled the door open, and peered into a perfect black.

On the right was a panel and he was sorely tempted to feed it, but whatever light it fed to would almost certainly bleed under the door. A pace in, he could barely make out the edge of a step. He would have to close the door and feel his way down an unknown staircase through utter darkness.

Doubt flared only a moment before the thought of his prize burned it away. He would not turn back now.

Step by step, he carefully worked his way down, his fingers lightly touching each wall. At first his fingers trailed polished wood, but that soon gave way to rough stone. About the same time, the creak of wood stairs were traded for the sting of bare feet on cold stone. After some more steps, it finally levelled out.

Sal would have counted the stairs; he'd have known exactly how many, how tall, and how far they'd gone down. Roland would have said there were a dozen stairs or ten, maybe, and Sal would corrected him. Fourteen, he would say, and he would tell Roland it was exactly this time, and they had that much time left. Roland had no idea how long he'd crept down the stairs; it felt like forever.

"It's just not the same," Roland said into the dark, which seemed to swallow his voice in a vast emptiness.

That was odd; he'd expected the sound to feel more contained. He cocked his head and took another step. The walls opened up, forcing him to choose a side but panels were always on the right, so he went right. He followed another two steps before he felt a square indention in the stone.

Relief washed through him. All this darkness was getting under his skin. He pushed a stream of energy into the panel and waited.

Nothing.

He fed it more, at least doubling the energy. Though it still felt like the barest of trickle, it was far more than a single light should need.

Still nothing. He frowned. What the hell was he feeding?

He pushed even more energy into it and suddenly a row of lights all lit up at once, arranged parallel to the wall.

"Woah..."

The basement? — no, not a basement, more like a cavern filled with rows of shelving — was far larger than he'd expected... or at least far wider than he expected. He couldn't see the end. But he could see another row of lights, so he pushed more energy until that row lit up, revealing yet more of the cavern and yet another row of lights beyond. He shook his head and continued pushing energy until the panel finally resisted further attempts. At least ten rows had lit up.

He began to walk down the center isle, momentarily forgetting his point for sneaking down here. The whole compound had been built on top of this... cave, which had been filled with shelves — he looked up — and pipes and conduit of some sort. But at least this row of shelves was empty.

About half way down he turned down a cross isle and began peering down each row. Not all were empty. Some were filled with what looked like building supplies, others with parts, maybe. And others—

Oh, food! His hunger clawed up his throat, forcing him into a run while pretty much every other thought fled his mind. He soon came upon stacks of hard cheeses. He stopped, grabbed one, and took a bite.

"Oh ugh!" He reflexively spat it out onto the floor.

It was not cheese, or not any he'd ever had. He turned it over. There wasn't mold so he didn't think it was bad, just really strong. He slowly worked the gummy-like remnants out of his mouth and spat again.

This time he was more careful, first sniffing the cheese before he found one that at least smelled safe. Still strong but edible, he chewed a piece while walking toward cured meats laid out beyond the cheeses. He switched out the cheese for a smoked sausage that tasted perfectly fine.

He ate as he explored, often switching out one food for another. There was an astonishing variety even though it all took up only a small portion of the basement. It turned colder the further he went, and soon he was shivering while he looked at stacks nearly frozen raw meats of all sorts.

He chewed on a carrot while he stared at it all in confusion. He knew Rose kept the food down here — it'd been his entire purpose for breaking in — but he'd expected a small basement. This was far too much food, even for him, and it still only filled a small corner of a massive room that could store enough food to feed a small army for months.

It was also way too cold. Yes, caves were damp and cold, but they shouldn't freeze things, not even in the winter. He abandoned the meats and continued walking toward the front corner of the room. The temperature continued to drop until his breath came out in white puffs tinted blue by the lights above. Much of the food was covered in ice now, but his attention was focused on the wall.

The wall was covered in what looked like tubes of ice. Ignoring the cold, he scratched at it, which flaked off to reveal iron behind it. Frowning, he took a step back and followed the piping to a large box of metal and wood. He put his hand on it, feeling a small vibration that hummed lightly and behind it, just on the edge of his perception he felt something rhythmic resonate within it.

He shook his head. It was gravtech, he was sure, but gravtech had to be fed and not only was there no place to feed the contraption that he could see, but Rose wasn't down here enough to keep it running, not unless it had some truly massive reservoir. There was, however, some kind of conduit leading down to it, a thin, rigid thread of gravwood hidden by the ice until it peeked out where it met the ceiling.

Roland followed it, weaving his way through mostly empty isles until he reached yet another contraption off center of the room and hidden behind shelves in a clever way that wouldn't have been noticeable if he hadn't been following the thread. He had no idea what to make of it. At least a dozen thread-like conduits descended from the ceiling down into a complex gravtech device that looked decidedly flower like. The threads wove and twisted, turning in on themselves endlessly in a central stalk. Limbs of woven threads branched out and then flared into intricate, spiralling patterns that reminded him of flower petals reaching out for rain.

He reached out and touched one of the petals. A small stream of energy broke away from within him and was pulled into the petal. He snatched his hand back.

It _stole_ his energy. He stumbled back. It was impossible. Gravtech was always fed; it didn't steal energy... except that this one clearly did. As if that weren't enough, he strongly suspected the device was snatching energy right out of the air.

And that was yet another impossibility. Only living things could make the energy that fuels gravtech. This was as foundational a truth as the sun was warm and all things pulled down. There are stories of people who tried, of course, but it was a fool's venture, like trying to create something from nothing.

So what was feeding this device? Who's energy was it stealing?

Roland stared at it for a long time but no answers would come and eventually he grew tired of looking at it. Also, he was thirsty after all that food.

He absently wove himself back out to the front of the cavern. He wasn't sure how long he'd been down here, but the lights hadn't faded yet, although he wasn't sure what that meant. Generally, a gravtech light would remain lit for a couple hours after fed, but he'd pushed a lot more energy into these. A glance at the panel showed no cutoff common to household lights. These lights would just have to work through the energy he'd given them... even though there was device beneath them presumably capable of feeding them forever.

He turned his back on the paradoxes and climbed the stairs back up into the darkness. He had his hand on the door handle when he froze.

Voices?

He pressed his ear to the door.

One was Rose and the other male, but it had a foreign, melodic accent he couldn't place. He continued down the stair until he could hear their words.

"How old?" the man said.

"Twelve."

"Twelve? A little young."

"You will not take it easy on him."

The man snorted. "It's been too long, Lady Rosiland. You seem to have forgotten who I am."

Roland's eyes flew up. Rosiland. He mouthed the name. Huh.

"It's Rose here."

"Ah, of course. Lady Rose. How... appropriate."

"I mean it, Sora. The boy is more resilient than any you've trained before. And he picks things up rather... quick."

Roland almost fell down the stairs. Did she just compliment him?

A pause followed; Roland pressed his ear in.

"Explain," the man said.

"He broke his arm a while back trying to run away. It had healed completely in a week. Bruises are gone in a few days."

Roland absently rubbed his arm. Did it heal quick? He wasn't sure. He couldn't recall his parents mention it and Sal was so careful he probably never broke anything.

"That is more than resilient. What is he?"

"Someone with a lot of potential."

"You've been training him?"

"Of course."

"Hmm."

"Start with unarmed. The rest will come later."

"Schedule?"

"Afternoons and evenings for the next several days. I'll still take mornings for now. The tutor will come in a tenday, but I plan to start him on the basics before then."

"I would like to watch."

"Of course."

"Temperament?"

He could hear her breathe out a huff; it made him smile.

"Stubborn, impetuous, likes trouble, acts before thinking, complete disregard for authority—"

"Yes, yes, I know the type."

"Either way, I'll break him of it."

Roland suppressed a snort. Break _him_? Not likely.

"Careful you don't ruin the tool you wish to shape."

Rose didn't respond, but Roland didn't need to see her to know the flat, dangerous look she'd given the man.

"Breeding?"

A longer pause this time, followed by a sigh. "Peasant, but I forbid the word. Never refer to him as such."

Roland's eyes narrowed. Rose sounded as if he'd been mud splattered on her person. He knew that technically he was a peasant, but no one in town had ever called themselves that. They were just people, citizens of the Empire same as everyone else, and while there were Royals that would consider them peasants, most in town would consider that a blessing; Royals had notoriously high death rates.

"Hmm," it sounded like a nod, "men naturally become their labels, but just because he was born low doesn't mean he's not intelligent."

"Oh I know that, but I found him about as remote in the mountains as you can get. It does not bode well, but I intend to see him educated well enough to at least pretend to be something more."

"And may I ask what you aim for?"

Roland's ears perked up. Answers, finally.

"You may not."

He sighed. He'd figure it out someday.

"And our location?"

"I don't care if you figure that out, but you'll keep it to yourself."

Roland rolled his eyes hard and let out another sigh.

"Of course, milady."

"None of that. Refer to me as Rose and nothing more."

Roland frowned as the silence stretched. The man had granted her honorifics as though they were expected. Roland always assume she was rich, but this suggested she was more.

"I see," the man said, "and may I assume this applies to the others?"

"Of course it—" she cut herself off, then followed with a low chuckle. "Very good old man; you gained acumen in your age."

"A natural result of my occupation, I'm afraid. I could hardly help it."

"I suppose you of all people should know my plans."

"I highly doubt that."

"A tutor, as you know, and you of course. A cook and at least one servant, maybe two later, once we bring more weapons masters. I might add a second tutor if he does well enough but..."

"You construct from nothing an entire school, all to teach a single boy."

Roland leaned in, causing the door to creak. All she needed to do was admit something, _anything_ that might tell him what her plans really were. This... school she was constructing highlighted his importance, and from it he could almost believe he really was this godling she'd spoken of, but he still half expected her to realize it was all a mistake and kill him for not being this powerful weapon she expected. And still, nothing about all of this told him anything new. He still didn't know _what_ she intended for him. What was the point?

"I do believe it is time for me to meet the young man," the man said after several seconds.

The bigger problem was this man knew less than Roland. He was was certain anybody Rose brought would be ignorant of her plans. At the same time, these people would take up _his_ time, giving him less a chance to extract the information from Rose... not that he'd done anything of the sort. But really, he'd barely gotten started.

Still, this Sora obviously knew Rose. That itself would be a source of information.

Also, shit. He'd finally processed the man's last words.

He took a step back from the door, then followed it with a deep breath. The key was to own the place, or at least act like it. He took a second to compose his face and then stepped through the door like it was a perfectly normal thing to do.

Rose sat in her customary spot, her chair face away but she was pivoted to face him and her expression was that of perfect calm that practically screamed annoyance to Roland. The man sat adjacent to Roland's seat, which would normally be right across from Rose. He was different from anybody Roland had seen before. His eyes were almond and narrow. His skin was smooth except for well defined wrinkles around his eyes and mouth. He had pitch black, straight hair that had been pulled off of an equally straight back and back into a bun. He wore a tight-fighting blue vest over which was a loose robe that hid the rest of his body.

Three plates had been arranged on the table, each filled with a variety of cheeses, meats, and crackers. His stomach growled, somehow pretending he hadn't just stuffed his face only a few minutes ago.

He walked to the third drawer down at the center of the counter, the only drawer conspicuously still open. He spared it an accusing glare, as though it alone were responsible for his failure to close it. With nimble fingers, we wove the key back to its original place, then closed the drawer slowly, letting the sound of it fill the room before it closed with a clack.

Satisfied, he turned around and paused.

The man, Sora, stood in a smooth motion. He was graceful, but it looked planned, as though he considered what he wanted to do, planned it out, and then did it as efficiently as possible. He then bowed at the waist to almost parallel the ground, waited for an uncomfortably long moment, and then rose.

"A pleasure," he said.

Roland returned the bow with a long blink.

"Ummm... you too?" he replied, not even pretending to understand what just happened.

"Roland, this is Ye—"

"_Master_ Yeng."

"Of course," Rose continued, "Master Yeng. He will be teaching you the art of combat."

"Right." Roland drew out the word. Wasn't that what she'd been doing? He levelled narrow eyes at her, then walked to his seat, sat down, and began eating the cheeses and meats.

"I look forward to our time together," Master Yeng said as he sat back down. His eyes never left Roland.

Roland spared a look at the man, who maintained a passive, if mildly pleasant expression.

"Who are you?"

"I am Master Sora Yeng. I founded The Royal Sután Academy of Arts."

Roland's brow pinched. "You teach people to paint?"

To his annoyance, Master Yeng only chuckled. "I suppose you could say we do, although we've exchanged our brushes for fists and weapons."

"Right." Roland returned to his meal.

---

"Tell me of your town." Master Yeng said, folding his arms behind him. He hadn't removed his robe.

"I though you were supposed to start with unarmed combat."

Master Yen's lips pinched in amusement, though it held none of patronizing sarcasm of Rose's infrequent smiles.

"Oh, I believe we'll have more than enough time for that. For now, I would know of you."

They stood center of the courtyard. Roland shifted on his feet, unsure of how to place them. He felt naked without a weapon and vulnerable standing still. His eyes darted, looking to the ground for his weapon. Rose wasn't even here, and he still found himself unconsciously wanted to move away from her expected blows.

"Why?"

Master Sora Yeng took his time answering; Roland's foot began kicking at the sand.

After an insufferable amount of time, Master Yeng shifted his view to toward the mountains. "A teacher who fails to know their student fails to teach."

Roland's foot stopped. "Huh?"

"I watched you train with Rose; you have made admirable progress, but her training is focused. My desire is not for you to learn forms and weapons or, even, to simply avoid the pain of a training stick." His gaze sharpened. "I would help you build a foundation you can use for all that you need it to. For me to help you, I must know you."

Roland stared down at the dirt while his face moved through conflicted emotions. He had no idea what Master Yeng meant, except that it was different from Rose and, for some reason, this man wanted to know more about him, something Rose had never bothered with. A part of him wanted to rebel, to say something sarcastic, to say nothing at all. Another part couldn't destroy his only chance at something different. That part won.

"It was just a town."

"Just is always but the illusion of distance. All towns become something more as you draw closer. What did you do in your town?"

"We sold wood."

"Ah, and did you cut down the trees or perhaps you handled the money?"

"Uh no..."

"Then what did _you_ do."

Roland frowned, trying to figure out what Master Yeng was looking for. He was just a kid. School? His family? His friends— friend? Sal; sorrow flared at the thought. He didn't even know if Sal was alive. He could have made it, but the thought felt like a lie.

"We killed monsters."

It sounded stupid, but Master Yeng's eyes lit up.

"Did you work together?"

"No, Sal was usually the monster, but sometimes I was. I think he hated it."

"But he did it anyway."

Roland nodded, fighting the tears threatening his eyes.

"That sounds like a good friend."

Roland didn't nod; he didn't trust himself.

"I bet you two got in a lot of trouble."

"Not Sal, he..." his voice broke.

"He was the good one?"

He shrugged. "His father wasn't nice..."

Master Yeng nodded. "So you took him to slay monsters."

"I think he hated it," Roland whispered.

"But perhaps he needed it."

He frowned and chewed his cheek. He'd never considered that.

Master Yeng turned suddenly and walked to one of the surrounding benches. He slid off his robe and folded it, revealing a white shirt bound by his vest and dark grey trousers loose enough to easily move in.

He walked back, placed him a few paces from Roland and bowed at the waist. Roland stared at him a few seconds, then bowed in return; it seemed the thing to do.

"The Art of the Unarmed revolves around balance," he said, rising from his bow. "While you've learned balance from the sword arts, it is an act of counter-balancing your own weapon. With unarmed, you must counterbalance your very opponent. Do you understand?"

Roland shook his head.

"Good. Now, take a balanced stance."

Roland did so, feeling awkward with nothing in his hands.

"Keep your feet on the ground."

"But my feet are on the— ah!"

Master Yeng moved far quicker than Roland would have guessed. Within a blink, he moved in and pressed against Roland's chest. As Roland flinched forward to compensate, Master Yeng pulled on his arm and suddenly Roland was on the ground, unsure of what just happened.

Master Yeng offered a hand, then pull Roland back to his feet.

"Tell me what happened," he said.

"You pushed me off balance."

"I did not."

Roland frowned, replaying the events in his head. "You pulled me off balance?"

"Not exactly."

Master Yeng stepped up and placed his hand on Roland's chest. He pressed lightly. "Are you in a stance?"

"No."

"Are you off balance?"

"No."

"This is all the pressure I used."

Roland blinked.

Master Yeng took the same arm as before and pulled on it. Roland shifted his weight.

"Are you off balance?"

"No."

He let go suddenly, then pushed on Roland's chest. Unprepared, Roland suddenly found himself reeling back. He tripped and fell to the ground.

"You tripped me," he said as Master Yeng once gain pulled him back to his feet.

"Did I? Are you sure?"

Roland pinched his lips. He wasn't sure.

"Did I pull you off balance?"

He sighed. "No."

"Did I push you any harder than I did before?"

"Well, no but—"

"Then why did you fall?"

He replayed the fall in his mind and finally realized what Master Yeng was getting at.

"I pulled myself off balance, and you used it against me."

Master Yeng took a step back and gave Roland a shallow bow. "And now you've grasped the first and primary principle of unarmed combat. Let us now work on the forms of balance."

Master Yeng first adjusted Roland's stance, then began moving him through forms entirely different than what he'd been accustomed to. After only a bell, he was sweating heavily, his muscles shaking, while he once again tried maintain balance twisted up in an impossible pose. Those would have been bad enough, except Master Yeng insisted on shifting between the forms very, very slowly. Roland fell over a lot and would have given up had Yeng not made it look entirely effortless.

Roland collapsed to the ground when Master Yeng finally signalled the end. He'd barely regained his breath before Master Yeng had him back on his feet in the first form.

"Keep your feet on the ground."

Roland's first instinct was to tense up, except his muscles felt like jelly and tensing felt like too much work.

Master Yeng moved quickly and pressed on his chest. Instead of compensation, which again seemed like too much work, Roland turned and shifted, allowing Yeng's pressure to slide off. When Master Yeng pulled on his arm, he didn't resist, instead allowing himself to be pulled forward while keeping his feet balanced under him. As Yeng let go, Roland grasped his arm and pulled, attempting reverse the move.

It did not work out.

Roland looked up from the ground at the offered hand as he tried to figure out what happened. He'd expected resistance when he grabbed Yeng, but again found his own effort used to throw himself off balance.

"I tripped myself," he concluded as Yeng pulled him back to his feet.

Master Yeng graced him with a small smile and nod. "Again?"

The question stunned him. Never had Rose asked; it was always a command, and one back by pain at that. Yeng had asked him truly. Roland had no doubt he _had_ to train, but Yeng wanted him to want it. Oddly, that made him want it. He nodded.

As the afternoon faded into evening shadows, Roland discovered that Yeng had a different kind of brutality than Rose. Rose was all hard edges, bruises, and pain. Hers were lessons learned the hard way through the misery of your own mistakes, every one pointed out and detailed while you bled on the stone. Yeng was like a river that flowed, inexorably, constantly, unrelenting. He was patient and kind, but he never stopped. His was a gentle brutality of unending effort, and at the end of it, Roland had never been more tired in his life.

It was also the happiest he'd been in months.
