# 23 | Mother [Lian]

The room was silent except for a light staccato of quick scratches. Light filled the center of the room, but left the edges cast in shadow from rows of identical bookcases that contained their own rows of identical books. Their only distinction, both bookcase and book alike, was an elegant, hand-written date range.

At the center of the room was a table, deceptively simple with no ornament or indication it was made of the most expensive material in the world. At the table was a single chair, equally expensive, and in it sat a dark skinned woman dressed in a flowing dress several centuries out of date. She was a somewhat plain looking woman, gifted neither with exceptional beauty nor cursed with ugly definition. Her face was simply unremarkable and though it held an agelessness, one would have to look twice to see it. No one every did. If there were anything remarkable about her, some feature that could be pointed to as uniquely hers, it would have been her hair. It was, put simply, a catastrophe. Spiralled curls extended in every possible direction, each coarse strand upholding its own weight and creating a halo that didn't frame her face as much as dwarf it.

Her face was relaxed, meditative even as she scratched ink onto velvety paper with precise, practiced motions. Though she wrote quickly, her penmanship was as perfect as her posture, and could have been easily mistaken for pressed ink rather than written script. The words themselves were of no importance— musings of the day, bullet lists of events both grand and personal, philosophical musings, political conjecture, ideas of the moment. Anything was fair game because the words didn't matter. It was the act of writing itself that held the true value. Once that act was done and the book was filled, it would be placed at the end of a long row of identical books, adding to one more of a long row of identical bookcases that filled countless rooms.

The words were not important, but emperors would sacrifice armies to read them.

The scratching continued for a time, then paused. It continued another sentence, then two, then paused. A rhythm, a meditation. More words, carelessly articulate from a stream of consciousness. Pauses born of thought. More words birthed from the silence.

And then, a longer pause. The pen hovered above the paper, wavered, then was slowly set aside. A new sound filled the air as her lips moved, counting the seconds.

Her voice was at first calm, still reflecting her meditative state. As more seconds passed, tension entered her tone, and that tension increased as each second ticked by. Eventually her voice became breathy, her expression incredulous, before settling into a more resigned tone. And still she counted until she abruptly reversed into a countdown. The entirety of the countdown was spoken in a resigned whisper. It continued into the negatives for a few seconds, then stopped, allowing silence to finally reign supreme for almost a full minute until its peace was broken once more.

"Shit."

Her calm now shattered, she almost closed her journal right then, only stopping as the ink glistened in the light. Her lapse disturbed her more than the prospect of smeared ink, as it reflected a chaos of the mind she could ill afford.

She lay flat the book, considered a moment, then picked back up her pen. She skipped a line and began writing again. A title first, then a vertical line down a quarter of the page. A horizontal line followed it. Labels were added, then numbers along each axis. Within the graph she sketched a bell shaped curve, adding values to its peak and at each end of the curve. Below the curve she wrote out calculations of distance, tolerances, and estimations of magnitude. A map was retrieved from a nearby desk along with a ruler, and on it she carefully measured out the distances she calculated, noting tolerances as small marks around a central mean. She grabbed a separate piece of paper from the desk, walked back to her journal, and copied her calculations.

Once done, she rolled up her map and walked out of the room. Whereas her writing room was panelled in wood, the hallway stood in stark contrast with a granite floor and glowing walls of ice. Graetech lights had been cleverly hidden beneath the floor to reflect into the walls, giving a steady light that diffused through the ice and seemed to come from everywhere.

Her destination was not close. So with barely a thought, she *compressed* the space, allowing her to traverse the entirety of the hallway in a single step. At the end of the hallway was not a door but a wall. Aside from the doors to her writing rooms, the hall had no discernible entry or exit. Yet within it were miniscule, virtually invisible cracks natural to the ice when it formed. She took one of those cracks, which she sensed more than saw, and *stretched* the space, opening it until it would just accommodate a her-sized person. Another step and she was through.

It took her ten more steps to reach her destination, a trek that would take any normal person at least half an hour at a brisk pace— her palace was not small. She stood before an ornate double-door of brass and wood that some long-dead artist had carved and gilded into scenes of a battle between fantastical beasts and equally fantastical god-like beings of power. She might even be able to remember the battle if she thought to bother.

Like just about every other door, she didn't bother to open it. Instead, she stepped through the space between the doors, *stretching* the space around her.

She was greeted by a cacophony of loud conversations, which immediately died down as every person in the room turned to look at her. She waved them off and walked— normally —toward a young looking woman with dark hair tied up in a bun.

"Asa, double check these, if you would."

Asa took the map and note. "Yes, my lady," she nodded.

She walked over to a table and spread out the map as conversations picked back up into a more subdued din. On the table were spread out similar maps. Asa began to compare them and add notes.

As she did, the lady walked over to a wood console embedded into the wall. In it were embedded a series of ten indentations molded precisely to fit her fingers. She stared at it a moment, idly tapping the side as her face betrayed hesitation. It said something that even under dire necessity, she would hesitate to make the call, and that for no more reason than it would be a thoroughly frustrating experience. She briefly considered whether she could simply deal with the situation herself, but the rules were clear, rules she herself had helped write, and it was all but impossible the other wouldn't have noticed... well, some of them at least, if they could even be bothered.

She scowled at her indecisiveness and, before she could talk herself into ruining millennia of peace, she placed her fingers on the console and began to feed into it a complex pattern of graescence that was, simply put, pure overkill. Never mind that the only person that knew the key was the one using it, but precious few people could even power the device anyway.

And yet... one could never be too careful with a device that could, quite literally, summon the gods to their Council.

They key entered, the lady then placed her hand on a central knob and *pushed* into it an absurd amount of graescence. Everyone in the room immediately stopped talking. Most had to grab a table or chair to remain standing. Several sat down on whatever would support them, even if it was just the floor, waiting for the moment to pass. Within the device graescense built up, its resistance increasing until a tipping point was reached. A damn broke and the graescence within *pulsed* out in a highly structured wave of distortion that immediately disappeared into the fabric of the reality.

Around the world, counterparts to this device would soon receive the signal, causing what had to be them most expensive alarm bells in the world to summon a gathering of possibly the most annoying beings in the world.

She flinched as a hand rest on her shoulder. She turned to see Asa smiling sadly at her. Behind, two people had passed out and three of them emptied their stomachs. It was better than last time at least. She noted them with the intent to study their cycles in the hope she could improve the next iteration.

"Lian," Asa said, placing her hand on the lady's cheek, "you'll be fine."

Lian snorted out an indelicate sound. "Of course I will."

Asa placed her other hand on cheek, framing her face, and pulled Lian in until their foreheads touched.

"It'll be fine," she whispered.

"They're gonna call me that...thing," Lian whispered back.

"They're just trying to push your buttons. Don't let them get to you. You're stronger than that."

Lian closed her eyes and sighed. "I know."

"You'll be fine." Asa tilted her face and gently kissed her.

Lian leaned in to the kiss for a second, then pushed her off. Asa's mask slid back into place but for her eyes, which still held warmth. Lian took strength from it, then took a deep breath and calmed her face into her own impassive mask. She gave Asa one last look of gratitude and turned to the double doors.

While she could travel directly from within the palace, to do so would likely incapacitate a fair number of her staff for weeks, if not kill them outright. So instead, she picked a convenient place on top of the palace and *stepped* on to it, bypassing several closed doors, thousands of stairs, and endless hallways.

The wind howled and tore at her cloths for only a moment before she shaped a bubble of stillness and funnelled a bit of warmth into it from the room beneath her. On either side of her, the ice blades extended hundreds of feet above, and thousands of feet below. The wind, funneled by the blades into the ravine they formed, could freeze a person to death in mere minutes... or seconds.

She stood there, silently idly admiring how the blue-white blades pierced a crystal blue sky. She was standing on one of the highest points of her palace, most of which was embedded into the blades. Below her were shielded walkways of ice, bridged across the blades and connecting the various wings of her palace.

She was procrastinating, and despite her influx of warmth, it was already starting to get chilly. She drew graescence and began to stretch, twist, and compress the fabric of space. Unlike her palace, she couldn't make the journey in a single step. The distance was simply too vast to even try. There was only one person who'd ever been capable of the feat, and she'd been too broken to manage... to broken to fix... and... and...

"Dead," she whispered, allowing her work to unravel.

Always this happened. Every single fate-cursed council. Asa was wrong. She wasn't strong enough and never had been. Every single council was the same. They would stab her, over and over again, casually, without regard to the pain they caused, until they left her a broken wreck. A knife composed of a single word against which she had no defense.

And... this was the way it's always been. She need but keep her mask up long enough, just as she always had. Because Asa was right. She knew she could do it, because she always had.

Space warped as she established her first landing zone, then again as she established her second. This occurred a dozen times in half as many seconds— she knew the route well and it was practically rote. She took her first step and arrived on a small plateau over a hundred miles away.

Were anyone there to see, they would see nothing they could understand. A strange twisting of the world mixed mostly with the colors of her dress and perhaps her hair. Of course, anyone near enough to see wouldn't be paying much attention as they would be preoccupied with emptying their stomach. Very few could tolerate what she did to space, and while she could take people short distances, it would be hours before they recovered enough to be functional. Her present trip would likely kill anyone other than her before the second step.

Or her...

The next steps proceeded as quickly as a brisk walk, space snapping back its shape on her heels, until she arrived in a cathedral dimly lit by cast iron torches.

She frowned while her eyes adjusted, trying to understand why no one had bothered to turn on the lights. The answer became clear as her eyes made out two forms at a large wooden table.

The first had an orb of light floating over his shoulder as he read from a stack of papers, likely reports. He had jet black hair, cut neatly, and wore an equally black suit immaculately tailored. He was thin, bordering on gaunt, with pale skin that spoke little of the sun. His face was severe with sharp angles that many mistook for a permanent scowl, though really that was just his face. In truth, he was a practical man, even tempered, and while he was not afraid to get his hands dirty, he tended to prefer to achieve his means through loyalty rather than fear. If he noticed her arrival— and he most certainly did —he made no indication of it.

The other man was almost the exact opposite. He was a bull of man, barrel chested, with freckled skin and hair like fire. She couldn't prove it, but he had to have dyed it— it was simply not natural. Regardless, it was apropos of his ability to handle flame, one of which was dancing along the top of his knuckles the way someone might do a coin. He was leaning back in his chair with his legs up on the table, a bored expression on his face as the flame danced to his will. He looked up as her first step echoed through the hall.

"Ah, mother," he said with only a hint of a sneer and returned his eyes to the flame.

He did not see her flinch in the darkness. He would not have cared if he did. She could bleed out on the floor without his eyes ever leaving the flame.

Lian walked to the wall and fed a panel set in the stone. Dozens of chandeliers lit a cathedral with no windows, and never would there be. It had been carved out of solid stone, deep within a mountain or, perhaps more accurately, *under* one. It had one massive entrance that led to twenty-seven massive wings, each one as impressive as her own palace. And yet, there was no entrance to this palace, no path one could trek, climb, spelunk, or even dig to gain entrance.

There was only one way into the palace of the gods, and already the first gate was forming. She ignored it as she made way to the head of table, sat down, and levelled her eyes on the man in black.

"Darsan, thoughts?"

"Bad," the man in black said without looking up.

"It's always bad," Forstal said in a bored tone, also without looking up from his flame. "Anything that summons the Council would have to be."

Darsan thumbed through a stack of paper, pulled a piece out, and shaped to float it to Lian.

She stared it as more gates formed. It was map similar to the one she forgotten to bring, also with similar markings, denoting an arc with tolerances written in. She mentally compared it to the one she'd made.

"Northern Santonia then," she said.

Darsan looked up, then gave her a questioning glance. She shrugged in response. Yes, she'd forgotten to bring the map, but she wouldn't apologize.

"You're sure of this magnitude?" she asked, returning her eyes to the map.

"Quite."

She sighed and shook her head. Bad was an understatement.

"And?" Forstal said.

She didn't bother answering, but slid the paper toward the self-proclaimed fire mage. It caught the air and flipped up, but was snatched out the air. Forstal casually glanced over and the fire stopped dancing, then sputtered out. His legs swung to the ground almost absently as he stared at the map.

He shook his head. "No, you made a mistake."

Darsan didn't bother with a reply.

"We have to do someth—"

"*You* will do nothing until the rest of us arrive," said the man who'd walked through the first gate, "or have you forgotten our law?"

Forstal visibly rolled his eyes as he put down the paper, slowly raised his two middle fingers into a v-shape, and shaped a flame between them.

"Child," the other man scoffed, before turning to Lian and bowing at the waist. "Mother."

She didn't flinch, but the knife struck true.

More gates opened and more of the gods arrived, though many of them would never call themselves that... anymore. It had been a... phase and probably one best forgotten. They'd certainly gone to extreme measures to make the world forget to the point that their very names were scoured and the gods were nothing more than a curse. It was better that way, all had agreed, and if some of them longed for the days when they were worshipped, well, they certainly wouldn't voice that at the council— those that clung to the past were destined to become a permanent member of it, forcibly.

They were an eclectic group. Many arrived with a full compliment of guards, servants, and other attendants, while other arrived alone. Some had integrated into current society, while others lived as hermits... for now at least. Three of them actually brought their personal harems with them.

Lian watched as the scantily dressed men and women walked by, hiding and revealing their best assets as best to tantalize. Each was one was a absolute specimen of carnal beauty and more than one looked at her with invitation in their eyes, but she ignored them. She'd long since reconciled herself to the practice, especially once she learned that all of them were treated well and all had joined voluntarily, but that didn't mean she understood it at all. She couldn't even claim it as chauvinism, as arguably the worst offender was a brow skinned woman dressed in... fishnet?

No. No, she did not understand at all.

Not coincidentally, all three sat next each other. Their wings were adjacent and very likely, they'd be the last to leave... months after everyone else vacated the compound.

The gods were an eclectic group, and yet each and every one of them greeted her in the same way.

"Mother."

It was her title, her honor, her curse. It was a poisoned knife to the heart and they stabbed her while she bled out on the floor.

"Mother, an honor."

"Mother, my pleasure."

"Mother," as sarcasm.

"Mother," with affection.

"Mother..." and it didn't matter how they said it, for the poison was always the same.

"Where the hell is Joshua?"

Lian blinked. The gods were seated, all but one, and she'd greeted them all with the same impassive face. The attendants had gone, and even the servants. This meeting was not for mortals. But before they'd left, they left wine and food piled upon the table, a gesture she found annoying— she had no intention of being here *that* long.

But Joshua... there was some debate as to whether they should continue without him, but others made the point loudly: the law was clear. No decision could be made without all the gods present. So they waited. Some ate, others drank, others talked, and some argued. There were friends, alliances, and enemies. Wars long forgotten by the world had not been forgotten by them, and they were waged in the shadows with casualties hidden by the night. It was the dark side of their agreement, for so long as the war remained unseen, it could not be punished or, at least, not by the Council.

Finally, a gate opened and immediately a mostly naked, rakish man stepped through, half way in the process of wrapping a robe around his body.

Joshua.

He was naked and yes, he was in the process of robbing himself, his half erect member clearly visible for all to see. He, of course, didn't care. He never did. Galielle though— the woman in fishnet —very much did. She had never hidden her desire for him, and she was practically salivating at the sight. For that matter, so was the Soren, the man sitting next to her.

It was an exercise of futility, for Joshua had never shown a desire for any of them. His thing was princesses and, occasionally, queens. There was a rumour he'd manage to suborn an empress, though none could agree which one. Regardless, he clearly wasn't interested in any of them. This rake's fair was naught but dissatisfied women in positions of hidden power.

And Lian strongly suspected he wielded the greatest political power of them all.

She also didn't care. While she was one of the primary architects of the iterative empire, she rarely paid attention to the current politics of the time unless it threatened to derail her plans. Joshua though...

He walked straight to her, bowed deeply, kissed her hand, and said those estimable words, "Lian, a greater pleasure as always."

And for that greeting alone she would support him to the end of days.

"Let us begin this meeting according the statues set as—" It was... dammit— What was his name? The first man through the gate, yet his name escaped her again.

"Yes, Al'Shoren, we know how meeting works," Galielle interrupted, still trying to catch Joshua's eye, who was pointedly *not* looking at her.

"We calculate this latest event to have magnitude of eighty-nine."

Silence descended as all eyes turned toward Darsan. He'd a habit of derailing argument with relevant information.

"You jest," said Sorah, an elegant woman dressed in the current style. She'd easily integrated into the current aristocracy as a minor... Chair? Ah yes, of the Royals; that's what they called themselves this iteration.

"I do not jest," Darsan replied.

Sorah scowled at him but it was true, he had never made any jest so long as... he'd been alive? At least so long as he'd been a god.

"Does the scale actually go that high?" said another, who's name Lian refused to even try to remember.

"We should eradicate him. I volunteer." That was the fire mage.

"Absolute not," said a man with an absurd mustache, "the last time you interfered, you eradicated half the Sorean forest!"

"Did I not get the job done?"

"That's not the point! It took us *decades* to—"

"Enough!"

All eyes turned to Lian.

"We're not here to rehash the mistakes of the past—"

"Hardly a mistake!"

"I dare dis—"

"We are *not* here to rehash!" Lian yelled, half standing from her seat.

She stared down the duo, who reluctantly sat back.

"If I may?" Dorsan interjected.

Lian closed her eyes and slowly sat back down. "Yes, please?"

"We've already dispatched my best Inquisitors. It should not take them long to resolve the issue."

"Bah! You and your *Inquisitors* can shove—"

"How is that suppose to help against a magnitude of... what was it?"

"Eighty-nine," Dorsan replied, "though that's hardly the point."

"How's that hardly the point?"

"I believe he's referring to the ah... refactory period," said Galielle, pointedly looking at Joshua in challenge. "Turns out, some men need time to recover."

Soren looked as her askance, "Not *all* men."

"Of course, dear. Some are more blessed—"

"Can we *not* discuss your vices at present?" said some other god Lian couldn't be bothered to remember.

"She makes a good point," Lian said, silencing the rest with quiet words.

They all turned to her, waiting, expectant. And she hated them for it.

"It will be quite some time before any godling can express their power so soon," she said, "especially after their first... breakthrough. Or do you not recall your own ascension?"

It was true. It could be mere months, but most likely years before that level of power could be expressed again. Years in which the godling would be vulnerable. And yet...

"That power, though. Even diminished, are we sure the Inquisitors are enough?"

"They are enough," said Dorsan.

Several of them looked like they wanted to argue, but in the end silence reigned. No matter your opinion of Dorsan, the effectiveness of the Inquistors he created was hard to argue.

"What about the location?"

Most of them seemed confused, but Dorsan dutifully passed out copies of the map which, Lian noted, included her own analysis— she had no idea when he'd added it to over twenty duplicates.

"Huh... so northern Santonia? I don't see the relevance."

"It intersects the Alderall."

"Ah," said another, "so it may just be a beast instead of a godling."

"So it could be contained already?"

"Humph, all this noise over a non-issue."

"We don't know that."

"But it seems likely..."

"Yes but what if it's not?"

"So what? It's not like..."

"Enough!"

"A vote should be reckoned," said another god before Lian could continue. It was one of the level-headed ones, and though again Lian did not feel the need to recall her name, she felt inclined to allow it.

They all looked to her, and she shrugged, "A vote then."

Her voice was tired, pained, damaged, though none seemed to notice.

"All in favor of allowing the Inquistors to handle the issue?"

Several hands were raised, and then more. Many of the gods were barely paying attention and, seeing hands raised, they raised their own, likely just an attempt to close what was to them a boring matter and move on. But it was enough, for more raised their hands as the popular vote gained traction until it was a majority.

In the end, only a few of them kept their arms down. And why not? Having some secret organization fix the problem leaving you to scheme, frolic, or fuck your way to oblivion was obviously the better choice. And the gods were, if anything, pragmatic about their vices.

Lian wasn't so convinced. It didn't matter, the gods had voted and by the laws she herself had helped draw, she was bound to them.

"Fine, let the Inquisitors deal with the godling, then." She stood and, the matter resolved, she began to walk away from the table. If she was lucky, she could step away before—

"A matter, Lian?"

She cursed her luck and turned to Joshua.

"Yes?"

"I fear that no matter how the godling is dealt with, it has already dealt a fatal blow to the empire as it stands."

Lian turned her full attention to the man, "Explain."

"Santonia is currently... ah, how should I put it?"

"How about, 'plainly'."

"Right. Well, Santonia has grown large of late, and it's made the Empire nervous."

"So?"

"So," he said slowly, "a godling in their midst will tip the scales quite severely in their disfavor, if only under suspicion alone. The Empire may well force the issue."

"I'm sorry Josh," Lian rubbed her forehead, "I fail to see the importance."

"The importance is simple. Should Santonia be... alienated from the Empire, the Empire will fall soon thereafter."

She frowned. "A single province... is the Empire so fragile now?"

"I fear so. Much if its strength is derived from that singe province, especially its economic and martial might. Moreover, it imports most of its weapons from Caldonia, which has been slowly constricting the market."

"Trade wars are not unusual, Josh."

"No, I agree, they're not. It's just the timing... it's unfortunate is all.I can too easily see this falling apart."

"That is proof of nothing."

"I offer no proof, matron, only a warning. This may well accelerate our next iteration."

Lian paused in thought. Joshua, no matter his tendencies, had excellent political acumen. If he said things were unstable, then it was quite likely the truth.

She nodded. "I'll keep an eye on it." And by she, she meant Asa.

He nodded, satisfied. "Well then," he clapped, startling those behind him, "I'll be off on my next conquest then!"

As he walked back her eyes were drawn to the line behind him. The gods had lined up, all to offer her partings.

She cried inside as the first of them approached with the dreaded words...

"Mother," the woman said, and Lian once again began to bleed.

---

She arrived at her palace late. The halls were cold and empty, barren, as she walked them. She had no desire to compress space and hasten her to her room. She knew what awaited her and while she needed it desperately, the numbness she felt was also appealing.

Did it matter if she was drowning her palace in her own blood if she didn't feel it?

Yet time betrayed her and, after a period that felt both too short and too long, she found herself standing before the door to her room.

She stood there for a long time before she summoned her courage. Her options were to enter or hide, and Lian had never before hidden. She wanted to, and desperately at that, but she couldn't start. For if she started hiding now, she wasn't sure she'd ever stop.

So, slowly, she opened the door to her own room, terrified.

Asa sat on a chair, opposite of the bed, reading a book that didn't matter. The moment Lian walked in Asa stood, absently placing the her book on the end table.

Lian stood slumped, defeated, moments from collapse. Asa caught her, holding her upright as she led her to their bed.

"It's okay, you're okay. You're safe now."

And as Lian began to sob, Asa rocked her back and forth as the pain of loss wrenched ugly sounds from her soul. They came in waves, wails and recovery, pain and exhaustion. Hours passed without relief until finally sleep forced itself upon her, dragging her into a nightmare filled oblivion.

"Sleep my goddess, forever will I be here to soften the blow," Asa whispered over and over.

And the goddess slept as tortured memories of who she once was, whom she was called, and of whom she longed to be filled her nightmares...

...mother.
