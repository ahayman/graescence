# 72 | Knives

Rose had gone insane.

It was the only possible explanation. She’d tired of the training. She’d tired of him. Maybe she’d written off so many years of his failures and decided to end it all. Perhaps time had finally popped the last screw holding her together.

Whatever the reason, she was trying to kill him.

She’d woken him up in the middle of the night, itself unprecedented, a first and, he desperately hoped, a last. For she handed him a brace of knives and gave him a single command.

Run.

This wasn’t about pain. It wasn’t about training or lessons, no lectures, no learning curve, nothing but survival. There was nothing practice about the weapons she used. Nothing restrained, nothing held back.

For the hundredth time, his hands checked his own brace of knives to make sure they were still there. They were the only weapons he had, and these weren’t the blunted things she used to pelt him with.

Sharpened steel sheathed around a gravic core. Each knife was a thin and almost fragile-looking, beautiful work of art. The steel head wrapped itself in elegance with intricate patterns that belied it's true intent. It was beautiful, and it was useless to him.

A twinge was his only warning.

He threw up a desperate shield in the general direction of a guess and was rewarded to see a knife embed itself in air, only a couple inches from his face.

The horror of seeing death so close, deferred only by an instinctual guess, distracted him from realizing a second knife had closely followed the first. It was the tickle down his arm that gave it away. He glanced over and felt mild surprise to see a knife embedded in his shoulder.

“Not good enough.”

Her voice did not come from the same direction as the knives, but neither did it reveal her person. She was invisible, a ghost, and she commanded knives from any direction or all of them.

He ran. The direction didn’t matter, not really.

Maybe if he knew where she was, then he could make some plan more coherent than ‘stay alive.’ As it was, running was the only sensible option, made oddly valid from her lack of reproach.

She wanted him to run, wanted him off balance.

He felt a surge of indignant annoyance that he was now the prey. That thought cycled into confusion, for it made no sense. This was far beyond the normal escalation of her training regime.

It was also beyond unfair, and he tried to feel angry, frustrated, or outraged, but the feelings refused to surface. It all felt surreal, as though the night had yielded itself to nothing more than a strange dream. If only he could wake up.

Another twinge, but he didn’t bother with a shield. Instead, he dove headfirst behind a tree and heard two thunks. He risked a quick glance around the tree in a vain hope the knives might still be there. If he could steal her weapons, perhaps she would stop trying to kill him, or something. But there were no knives embedded in the wood. She’d already recalled them.

He still had one, though, and that one he carefully pulled from his shoulder. Her knives were the same as his, embroidered death. In equipment, they were equal, which itself was a laughable concept. He would never be her equal, could never even dream of it. All these years and he still had no idea of what she was capable of.

He snorted softly to himself. It was a stupid idea, anyway. That woman would never be without weapons, even should he remove every single knife from her person.

The knife wrenched itself from his hand and _curved_ away into the night. She wasn’t simply _pulling_ them back to herself, not like he _pulled_. She wrapped them in a surface and guided them out to obscure her position.

He scanned the darkened woods frantically, but there was no sign of her, nothing at all to reveal where she might come at him next. Run, hide, dodge, or just sit still. It was all the same. The knives would still fly, and he would bleed. Habit told him to conserve his energy, take the hits, and solve the problem rationally.

She, though, had told him to run. It was not a command he could ignore without consequence, especially not when she appeared to be making every effort to kill him.

But even that thought refused to solidify, itself as evanescent as this dream seemed to be.

It couldn’t be right.

He’d be dead had she truly wished to kill him. It didn’t really matter how strong he was, her decades — or even centuries — of experience trumped all that.

Yet still, he ran.

Deeper into the forest, further from home, deeper into danger. He ran because she was trying to kill him, or not. He ran because of the terror he should have felt. He ran in fear of the pain he knew would come. But of all these things, he ran truly because she commanded it.

He trusted her in a way.

He hated her deeply, and yet he could not help but trust her. Trust, it seemed, did not require love or even the barest camaraderie. It was born of consistency, applied endlessly, and without fail over the years. Everything had a reason with her, a purpose. He didn’t need to understand it to know it was true.

She would kill him if he didn’t run fast enough, dodge quick enough, block hard enough. She’d made that quite clear. But he would live if he applied everything he had. This was the promise, the contract between them. She would make him bleed, and he would learn, but only after she’d broken him, and break him she would.

So why was the calm so easy now? His emotions didn’t rebel. They didn’t surge against their prison, didn’t press against the restraints. He felt oddly vacant as the empty he so often strove for embraced him willingly to consume his soul in the night’s darkness.

Not for the first time did he have to resist the urge to _pull_ and fly. He wanted to feel that freedom now, and it called to him. It felt right, as though this was the time, as though he’d always done it here. It was an advantage that would turn the tides.

But it was his secret, and he couldn’t let her have that, even if it meant dying at the point of a random knife throw.

Another twinge — no, two of them — and he threw up two shields. Both knives embedded themselves in the air, and then a moment later retracted into the night, each veering off in a different direction.

How the hell was he supposed to defend against that?

He swerved off in his run. It felt futile, but he did it anyway. It just felt better than running in a straight line.

Another twinge, another shield, another embedded knife quickly retracted. His arm stung and ached, adding to a chorus of cuts and bruises all over his body. Many of his older wounds had reopened and torn in his flight, but he didn’t have the time to consider these. He’d bled enough that it was merely on par with everything else in this hell he called a life.

The irony was that he could heal himself. It was painful, incredibly so, but doable. Yet it was another secret he refused to part with. He had so few, so precious few things that helped him hold on to his sanity, and he would not give it up.

He would not give it up, but he could do a little. It was risky, but then so was this whole night.

He pushed his cycle into a few of the wounds in his legs. The pain was intense, and he cursed himself for the risk. He almost stumbled and had to bite his cheek to keep from crying out as flesh and nerve forcibly reknitted under the flow of directed energy. He told himself the risk of discovery was only slight, and he needed his legs healed if he were to keep running. But if she found out—

Two more twinges, one blocked, but the other clipped his side and continued on into the night, veering off just before it disappeared. The pain had been too much of a distraction for him to block both, but at least he could run.

He tore off in a different, random, and probably useless direction. With his legs healed, he ran faster, moved quieter, his footing surer. He felt more at one with the night, and again he was struck with how familiar it felt.

The recent snows left spotty patches with autumn’s gifts poking though in a littered pattern. Both snow and leaves were loud in their own way, but he’d long since learned how to stalk. His body automatically moved into a crouch, and his gate altered to minimize the noise. Something about the position triggered a sense of déjà vu with a punch, and he wavered as two different realities collided in his mind.

All at once, he was both prey and predator. He was stalking the night and being hunted in return. He was moments from being skewered by a knife. He was moments from the kill.

These realities planted themselves in his mind, superimposed. Each one was perfectly legitimate, perfectly reasonable, and never had two truths been so opposed. They each fought and clawed his mind for supremacy. He grabbed his head and stumbled as he tried to reconcile such opposing truths, but they would have none of it. He could be predator or prey, but not both.

In the end, he had but to choose.

Yet there was no choice here, for he didn’t stand in the training ground against impossible odds. He ran through _his_ domain, _his_ realm. Here there was only one way for him to be. Here he was the predator, and so it could only ever be.

A low growl escaped his throat as fire and adrenaline burned his veins. An ache blossomed inside him. He yearned for this, needed it. The empty consumed his mind until it left only the craving of the hunt to guide him.

This shift in perspective brought clarity to all the mistakes he’d made that night. He never before entered a hunt without thinking through his prey’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as considering the environment they lived in and how to use it against them.

He’d played himself a fool, but even the beasts he hunted had never been so foolish as he. They, at least, had approached him from their strengths while he’d been running from his weaknesses all night long.

It was time for that to end.

He couldn’t negate every advantage. Rose had an advantage in her knowledge of his position even as he remained oblivious to her own. Her knives were dangerous, but they must be thrown, and so required range. If history were any clue, she’d stick to her knives and gravics, if only because this training of hers required it. At any rate, he couldn't allow her to close the distance, for a close ranged knife fight against her would last mere moments before she skewered him. But range he could use.

He shifted toward a thicker growth of trees he knew of and began to weave his way through them. He chose roots and rocks to tread on and _pulled_ in subtle ways to augment his jumps.

He couldn’t _pull_ much or else risk exposure, yet the advantage it provided was too much to forego. He changed direction frequently, made leaps with a _pull_ that strained credulity, and weaved randomly while staying within the denser area of the forest. He became silent, little more than a ghost to haunt the night.

Then he stopped.

The silence filled his ears in a thundering roar. He forced himself into stillness, then willed his heart and breath into an even, slow cadence. His body rebelled and thrust its need into his mind, yet greater was the need for quiet. Slowly the thundering sound of his heart and breath receded to reveal the true silence of the forest.

A soft drift of snow sprinkled down from the sky that reduced the visibility and smothered all sound. He glanced up to see a couple stars still visible, but then they began to wink out, and the night became dark in truth.

He didn’t wait long before he heard a small snap of twig rendered. It was her, and it was far off, but such things were deceptive. She could have easily planted the noise.

He moved quickly and silently jumped from root to stone as he made for a new position. Then again, he stopped and listened.

Another snap sounded through the trees, but it came from the wrong direction. She was playing games now. He didn’t think she could move that fast, but certainly, she could shape a surface to break a twig.

He needed off the ground. Height and elevation, perspective, was always an advantage.

The tree he hid by was no Whitewood, but there were plenty nearby. He pulled on several at once, enough to slide up the tree, faced outward as he scanned the forest for any sign of her. The rough bark pulled at his shirt and skin underneath. With luck, it would look as though he were climbing the trunk so long as she didn’t look too closely.

Look too closely, and weird wouldn’t even begin to describe it.

He made the first branch quickly and then climbed the rest. He _pulled_ only to maintain balance or for an extra boost until he was several dozen paces above the forest floor with a decent perspective of the surrounding area.

He settled in to wait, toes perched on the branch, while the snow let up.

While his eyes scanned the forest endlessly for his prey, his mind ruminated over this shift in perspective and what it meant. Only a few minutes ago, he ran through the forest for his life, and absolutely nothing about his circumstances had changed. Rose still hunted him. She had every advantage she started out with. Yet he was no longer running, no longer the prey, but instead a predator. The only thing that changed was how he viewed it, and that made more of a difference than if some ill fate had afflicted Rose to cripple her.

How many times had he allowed the situation to dictate how he viewed the world?

The thought was troubling enough that he shied away from the ramifications. There was so much damage inside him, so many scars. How much of it was self-inflicted? How much of that could he control, or at least reign in, through a shift in perspective alone?

He violently shook his head to clear the thoughts. Such reasoning would lead only to insanity, or at least deeper in than he already was.

Another snap drew his attention back to the forest. He didn’t bother to locate it. It was but another attempt to draw him out and a poor one at that. Did she think these noises would frighten him? He scoffed inwardly but flinched as he realized it would have worked only a few minutes ago when fear dominated him.

She thought he was still running. She was still trying to flush out a fearful prey.

Waiting for her wouldn’t work. He could sit up here all night with little chance of discovery while she made noises all over the forest in an attempt to flush him out.

He needed to draw her in. He needed to be the prey or at least an illusion of one.

His ability to shape surfaces was practically nonexistent compared to her. At most, he could shift and rotate some basic shapes, hardly more than shields, which itself was useful but not actually considered shaping.

Shapers manipulated the actual shape of their shields, thus the name. Doing this requires a deep instinctual understanding of gravic waves and how they interact, and that was something he still struggled with, working as he was through some incredibly advanced gravic math. So he could not wrap a twig and then morph the shape to snap it, but he could form a shield and press it into the ground, or even drag it through the dirt. He decided to do both.

He formed several shields and pressed them down in sequence, followed by dragging another a short distance, and finished it up with several more presses. His goal, of course, was to make it sound like someone running and stumbling through the forest, but it was poorly done. He couldn’t see how anyone would be fooled by it. Yet barely a minute later, he spotted her for the first time since she’d told him to run.

She wore all black — no red, incredibly — and moved like water. He almost missed her, and even after seeing her, his eyes were at constant risk of losing her. The recent snow had left a light dusting on her shoulder. Otherwise, he may not have been able to track her, at least with sight.

She stuck to the shadows as she moved and made no sound. She was, he realized, vastly better than he at stalking through the night. Or, she would be if he was stuck to the ground as she was.

She stopped at his fake tracks and knelt to examine them. Her body tensed, and her head shot up to scan the forest, no doubt realizing the trap.

He formed a shield and pressed it into the ground enough to snap a twig well out of sight. Her arm shot out and sent a knife flying into the darkness, aimed perfectly toward the sound. Just as it moved almost beyond reach, he _pulled_ on it hard to bring it back to himself and snatched it out of the air before tucking it safely into his belt. It was a risk doing this so near to her, but one that would answer several questions.

She didn’t move for a long time, perhaps listening for more noises, or perhaps consuming the secret he’d just revealed.

“Twigs don’t snap themselves,” he whispered to himself with a smile.

After a little more time, she finally moved in toward the snapped twig. He relaxed his shoulders as tension fled his body.

She couldn’t sense his _pulls_. His secret was safe.

Shields, surfaces, gravtech — these things were easy to sense when in use, which was why it was so important to trigger the sounds far enough out. He’d worried that his _pulls_ would be painfully visible to anyone with half a sense, even as he suspected they might not act on the same principles as most gravtech. That it could not be detected was a considerable advantage.

Feeling much more confident, he _pulled_ himself to the next tree, careful to avoid rustling any tree limbs. She might not be able to sense his _pulls_, but sight and sound could yet betray him should she be given a reason to look up.

He vowed to give her no reason to scan the darkened sky.

Before she’d made it far enough to retrieve her discarded weapon, he rustled leaves a little off her angle, just enough to suggest a chase. Her body froze, and he smiled as he imagined the indecision she must be experiencing. Retrieve the knife and lose her quarry or maintain the hunt and forgo the knife.

Given he possessed said knife, he decided to offer a little encouragement and lightly rustle more leaves just a bit further out. For a moment, he wasn’t sure she heard, but then she suddenly bolted into the night, silent as ever.

He was impressed at how quickly she could move through the forest with no sound, but in the end, her speed was nothing when he was _pulling_ himself through the trees, flying as it were through the night.

He pressed hard into the ground as she ran and broke something larger than a twig, making him wince even as she instinctually threw a knife into the night. He hadn’t intended to make quite that much noise, but he wasted no time to retrieve her blade.

Now he had two.

If she had the same brace as he, then he had only ten more knives to steal that night. The trick, he realized, was to create noise during the chase, which seemed to tease her instincts into reacting. She was much less likely to throw when she was still.

He spurred her into an illusion of a chase as he systematically relieved her of knives. He kept expecting her to see through the illusion, to look up suddenly and spot him high among the trees. It seemed impossible that she would not realize what he was doing, and yet she never faltered, never hesitated in her chase. She was convinced he was on the run, and no amount of shoddy evidence would persuade her otherwise. She was, he realized, not actually a good hunter. She lacked the experience of tracking prey, something he'd almost developed into an art over the years.

“You can only run so long, little boy.” Her voice came from behind him, though he watched her from behind. That was a trick he wished he knew.

He almost snorted out loud. It’d been a long time since he’d been a little boy, a long time. How many winters had he endured? He didn’t know. They blurred in his memory so that his very sense of time distorted beyond use. He simply didn’t know how long he’d been there, or even how old he was. It was a disturbing thought he didn’t have time for. What he did know was that the boy he once was had long ago died.

She was still using fear tactics, but now that he sat outside them, they fell flat and pathetic. Her perception of the situation was flawed, shifted roll reality, and from that, he held the real power now. He marveled at this truth.

It was all about perception, it always had been.

He suppressed a growl as every fiber in his body screamed at him to attack and end it there. She was weak and vulnerable. Her very perception was his to mold, and he owned her. He could take her on a chase or with one knife end all this.

But he didn’t.

Something held him back, and that something was called fear.

No matter how weak she seemed, he couldn’t bring his mind to accept it as truth. All his experience demanded that she be immortal and unkillable, and to attack her would only earn the kind of wrath that would break him. Or worse, it would lay every secret of his bare.

There was more besides this, a truth perhaps more substantial than even this block in his mind.

Killing her would end everything he knew, everything he’d learned to accept as real. There was no shift in perspective to change that, for there was nothing to shift that perspective to. She had molded a reality for him, and he’d consumed it whole. At that moment, he realized that he’d genuinely accepted his world here and that it was no easy thing to destroy one’s entire world.

He didn’t have the courage to even try.

Instead, he decided to pick up the game, for she would not part easily with her last two knives.

He positioned himself a little beyond her path and lowered himself to the ground behind a tree. When he’d judged her close enough, he stuck his head out.

She was closer than he expected, but not by too much, and she immediately sent a knife unerringly toward his head. He snatched his head back behind the tree and _pulled_, making sure to keep the tree between them.

He flew into the night and warped his path to land on a tree behind her. All the while, he kept a light pull on the knife so that it followed him. He snatched it out of the air with a flair of satisfaction only a moment after alighting on the branch.

A vicious smile curled his lips. And then there was one.

Removing the last knife from her would not be easy, and he briefly considered leaving her to the night. Yet that last knife meant something, had become something of victory to him.

Just as Sylas had stripped her of all her secrets so long ago, so would he strip her of everything else.

To leave her defenseless in the night, oh, but he craved that more than anything. He would strip her of everything, tear from her every dream, every shred of her sanity. He would abuse her, tear her apart, methodically, and with great pain. Her last knife would be but the beginning.

He _pulled_ himself through the night to once again alight on the ground, hidden behind a tree.

He ran.

He had to make an effort to stumble, to appear as prey rather than predator. He staggered and feigned a near fall before righting himself again to tear off into the night, her in silent pursuit and closing the distance with ease.

He dodged behind a tree in apparent desperation and _pulled_ to launch himself enough to gain distance. Then he continued to run as though nothing had changed.

She noted the increase distance with nothing except a knife in the air, just as he’d hoped. But there was no cover, nowhere to hide, not enough time to dodge, and he felt the knife embed itself in his shoulder.

Still, he ran and did so with a smile. She had, after all, commanded it.

He spotted a large tree and dove behind it as though for cover, but just as he would have landed hard, he _pulled_ instead and launched himself into the night.

She arrived only an instant or two later to find no one there and no tracks leading anywhere.

He flew through the night and after some distance, let out a laugh of exhilaration. Maybe she could hear him, maybe not. He hoped she could. He hoped she would hear the triumph, his laughter the echo of victory as she was forced to walk back without a single weapon in the dead of night and — he felt snow tickle his face... how delightful — now she would walk in the snow as well.

Despite the many hours he’d spent running through the forest, it took him only a couple minutes to make it home. He landed himself in the center of the training ground and walked calmly to the door as he considered what to do with her knives. He needed to make a statement, something to mark the victory, something to create fear.

He didn’t have long. He’d seen how fast she could move through the forest, and that while remaining silent. So he chose the simplest option he could think of and buried ten knives deeply into the door frame, spaced evenly, with only the hilts exposed. It would take force to remove those knives, a statement in itself. He returned his own brace to one of the weapon’s chests unused, also a statement. He’d won without drawing a single knife.

He kept one in his belt, the other still embedded in his shoulder, and walked into the house. Once in his room, he carefully removed the one in his shoulder and drove it into the door frame, blocking the door. Never again would she enter his room like she had that night. He smiled as the blood trickled down the door frame, scarcely glistening in whatever light had reflected back from the snow.

He’d marked his room with blood, making it his own for the first time. The final knife he embedded into the window sill, sealing off the only other entrance into his room.

Feeling satisfied, he took a moment to push enough energy into his shoulder to stop the bleeding. He wouldn’t risk any more than that, and so took out a wrap stored in a bathroom drawer to treat the remaining wounds.

He wasted no time to get to sleep. He’d already lost more than half the night, and he refused to lose even a moment more. He didn’t hear her come home, nor did he care. He would know if she attempted to interrupt his sleep again, and that was enough.

His last thoughts before he drifted to sleep was that he would never, ever be prey again. It had been so simple, nothing but a choice, and with that realization, he knew everything would change.
