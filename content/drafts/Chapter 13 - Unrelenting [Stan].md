# 13 | Unrelenting [Stan]

The snap of a twig drew open Stan's eyes to stare at the sky above. A smattering of stars peeked out between a thin layer of drifting clouds glowing orange from the reflective light of the moon, Iona. Half obscured by the forest canopy, no sign could be found of the green splotches of the slave plantations. Instead, towering mountain ranges haloed by thin-wispy clouds bracketed massive seas of sand interrupted by black cracked ravines. Barely more than thin scars, yet to be seen from so far, they were likely hundreds of leagues in width.

The cracked side of the moon, it was called, with winds that could scour the flesh from bone and scorching sun to bleach them. Unlivable, and yet he wondered if anyone lived there all the same. But these were old thoughts. Every child had asked and speculated on it countless times, drawing stories of heroes and villains upon the canvas floating in the sky.

The rustle of cloth drew him from his thoughts. He blinked several times and took a deep breath, only now realizing Min no longer lay next to him. He propped up on his elbows and found her crouched over several piles of stuff barely visible in the wan light. Her hands moved decisively, organizing the large pile into smaller collections of what looked like clothes, tools, and food.

"Are you okay?"

Min jerked back, falling from a crouch onto her haunches in surprise. Her expression quickly shifted from shock to anger, and she huffed out in exasperation.

"Give a little warning," she hissed.

"Sorry, I justâ€”"

"It's fine," she waved him off and pushed herself back into a crouch. "I couldn't sleep, so I figured..." She waved at the pile.

"Right." He stared at it for a few seconds before shuffling over. "Can I help?"

She shrugged. "I don't know if I got everything we need, but they had a lot of stuff packed up. I think it's for their..." her face twisted, "hunters."

"Hunters?"

"They were all out...hunting, I guess? I don't know. She just said she was waiting for them to come back before...before..."

Min's hands bawled into fists, shaking slightly.

"It's okay."

He shifted forward to grab her hand at the same moment a snap of twang reached his ears. A whistling sound preceded a sharp pain in the back of his head, causing him to instinctively reach back to finger it. They came back wet. He stared at them in confusion.

"Arrow?"

Stan shifted his gaze to Min. "What?"

She wasn't looking at him, though, but to the side. Her eyes widened suddenly in horror.

"They're here," she whispered.

"What?"

He followed her gaze to a rough-hewn arrow wedged into the dirt near the edge of the clearing, just shy of his short crystal wall. He stared at it, his brow drawn in confusion, like spotting a robin in the dead of winter, it didn't belong. He didn't understand.

The world suddenly flipped wrong-side up when something punched into his gut, sending him flying. A whistle tickled his ears as he fell.

"Protect us, you fool!"

He stared up at the face of fury, which had mounted him.

"Wha..?"

Another whistle caught the strands of her hair, pulling them along the progress of an arrow only a fate's breath away. With it, reality crashed into his consciousness.

He bolted up. "We're under attack!"

Min could not roll her eyes hard enough, or fast enough, not that it mattered. Stan launched himself up, throwing her off him in a tangled mess.

Short crystal walls embedded in the mud reached for the sky until they met the canopy above. While rain no longer assaulted the dome, it yet merged with the walls to form an impenetrable barrier.

An arrow snapped against the crystal as Stan slowly stood. He glanced around, peering into the darkness, yet could find no source for the attack.

It was odd. He'd been on the run for so long, yet the idea of an ambush had never really occurred to him. While Inquisitors had pursued him, they'd never come close to finding him. The only time he'd thought to protect himself fully, he'd almost died.

Turns out, fresh air was a requirement for survival. It was a lesson he never forgot.

Holes formed within the top of the crystal, allowing air.

"Where are they?"

Stan peered into the darkness, yet no movement could be found. Min followed her voice and rose from her tangle to join him, peering into the darkness.

They waited, searching the early morning night, yet nothing but silence answered.

"They're gone," he said after a time.

"They're not."

"I know, I know. But they're not here."

"They are."

Stan shook his head slowly. She wasn't wrong, probably. Within the absolute stillness of the early, morning he could hear nothing. Not the sound of birds, nor the sound of rain, nor the sound of stalkers with bows in the night.

"What do you want me to do?"

"Kill them."

"No."

The answer came quick, without hesitation. Perhaps too quick, given the flat expression Min gave him.

"I...don't understand you," she said.

"No. No, you don't."

He stood and walked to the edge of their glade, placing his nose right up to the crystal. This close, it was all but invisible. Yet he stared, peering into the darkness, trying to make out invisible shapes in the dark. Nothing stirred, nothing moved, at least, not that he could tell.

"Mother's grace, just take this."

He glanced over to see a bundle of dried jerky thrust at him. His stomach rumbled weakly, which wasn't a good sign. How long had it been since he'd eaten?

He took the bundle from her and began to chew, eyes firmly fixed on the still dark beyond. She was probably right; they were still there, watching. He just didn't know what to do about it.

Kill them. The answer was so simple, so clean. It was her answer, but it couldn't be his. It could never be his. Not ever.

He turned from the crystal shield and walked to the piles she had made of the supplies. She'd divided them into piles of food, clothes, and tools, plus one smaller pile. He approached it, noting the breeches and shirt, probably sized for him.

She watched him as he slowly picked up the clothes. He paid her no heed as he opened the jacket and wrapped it around himself. Next, he pulled on the pants, one leg at a time. All the while he ate while his stomach demanded far more than he could stuff down his gullet.

"They're going to come after us again."

Stan glanced at her as they walked. Morning had revealed a brilliant, clear sky. The soft shimmers of crystal undulated about the bush, then extended far above to wrap above them.

Stan wasn't taking any changes.

"Let them."

"Let them!?"

"What are they going to do? Shoot us with bows and casters?"

"Yes, yes that's exactly what they'll do.'

"And how do you do think they'll do that?"

Min grabbed his arm and pulled him to a stop.
