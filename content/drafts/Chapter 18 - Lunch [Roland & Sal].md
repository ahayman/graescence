# 18 | Lunch [Roland & Sal]

“Shoes off!”

Roland froze, eyes wide, and looked back at the mud-trail he'd dragged halfway down the hall. Sal stood by the door, his shoes placed neatly, while he waited patiently for the inevitable. Roland began to slowly walk backward , careful to place his feet in the mud trail—

“ROLAND ANSELM!”

Roland winced as his mom’s voice. Her eyes widened at the carnage.

“Sorry, mom.”

“Gods below, boy how— what happened to your face?”

Sal snorted out a quiet laugh.

"Again?" Roland's mom closed her eyes and sighed. "You cannot keep doing this."

"But they—"

"No!" she walked up to Roland, knelt, and looked him in the eyes. "Roland, you always have an excuse. What did they do this time, say something mean?"

“No!” Roland looked down. "They—"

"Because it doesn't matter. You cannot fix every problem in the world, Roland, and certainly not with your fists."

"I was just going to ignore them," Sal said quietly from behind.

Roland's mom looked at Sal and her face softened; she looked back to Roland and brought her hand to his clenched jaw.

"You're a good boy, a good person; but Roland," she wiped some of the blood off his cheek with her thumb, "there are better ways than this."

Roland kept his eyes glued to a spot on the floor, just to the right of his mom, his hands unconsciously balled into fists. After a few moments, his mom stood.

"I'll get towels," she said through a resigned sigh, and walked away.

Roland stared at the floor, took a deep breath, and held it. He released it in one explosive burst, turned to Sal, shrugged, and walked back, creating a new mud trail. He was removing his boot when a wet towel smacked him upside the head.

“Hey!”

“You will clean every spec of dirt in this hall before you take a single bite of lunch.”

“But—”

“No buts!” She turned to Sal, who was trying to blend into the wall. “Sal, you’re almost as filthy as Roland is. What did you two do, roll around in the mud?”

Roland shot Sal a guilty look.

“Never mind that,” his mom continued in a resigned tone, “come here, I’ll take your clothes. You can wear some of Roland’s for—”

“Wait, not my—”

“You! Clean.” She glared at him, her finger sharply pointed at the mud stains.

“Okay okay, fine.” But only because there was a lot of mud and he was hungry.

“Come on, Sal. We’ll get you cleaned up.” She led his friend back to his room as she mumbled under her breath.

He looked at the hall and sighed in dismay; it would be days before he ate again. His stomach growled in protest, so he swiped at the floor with the wet towel that only seemed to smear the mud.

Sal walked out a few minutes later wearing Roland’s clothes. They were clearly too large for him and he opened his mouth to say so, but a single look from mom shut it with a clack. He resumed his cleaning; it was the safest option.

“Clothes off,” his mother said.

Roland didn't look up. “No, thank you.”

“You will if you want to eat. You certainly aren’t trouncing about the house in that condition.”

Roland looked up at his mom, transferred his stare to Sal, then returned to smearing mud across the floor. His mom caught the look, rolled her eyes, and gestured Sal toward the kitchen.

“We’ll be just a minute, Sal,” she said.

Roland waited for him to disappear, then waited a bit longer to be certain.

“Roland!”

He huffed, sighed, and then stripped to his undershorts.

“You’re far too young to have an ego,” she mumbled as she wiped him down just a little too hard.

“Gods mom, I can clean myself.”

She snorted, but didn’t stop, and he knew better than to push it. Come home bloody and she sighs; track mud across her house and... well, he'd rather come home bloody. As he endured the indignity, a thought occurred to him.

“Mom?”

“Hmmm?”

“Can you make sure Sal’s clothes get really clean?”

She paused and shot him a confused look. “Sure, but why— oh.”  She frowned in thought, then began scrubbing him down again. “Tell you what, Roland, before you two go on one of your adventures, he can change— no, you _both_ can change into something more suitable. When you get back, he just needs to clean up and change back. How does that sound?”

“That sounds great.”

“Good.”  She gave him a last hard wipe and looked him in the eyes. “You’re a good kid, Roland.”

She tried to ruffle his hair but he swatted her hand away. “Stop it.”

She smiled and handed him clothes, then her eyes turned hard.

“Clean, now,” she said.

"Can I put on my clothes first?"

Her face flattened into a glare. He scrambled into his cloths, yanked the towels off the floor, and was scrubbing mere moments later. He did not dare look up, not even when she walked away.

It was hard being eleven, scrubbing away at mud while your best friend ate lunch. Roland wiped as best he could while he suffered the sounds of food being prepared. He cleaned quicker when he heard the noise die down, his mind filled with thoughts of food being eaten by not him. A few frantic minutes later, he triumphantly arrived in the kitchen with a rag that was far too dirty.

“Done!” He made straight for the kitchen table.

“Stop right there, young man.” She moved to block his path and motioned for him to hand over the dirty rag, which he did, only to find a clean cloth handed right back to him.

“Now, do it _properly_.”

“What? I did!”

“Uh-huh.”  She calmly walked over to the kitchen door, leaned out into the hallway, grunted, and then walked back.

“Pro. per. ly.”

Roland stared at the table with longing. His mother had taunted him by placing a plate full of food next to Sal, whose dish was already half-eaten.

“Don’t touch my food!”

Sal reached for Roland’s plate.

“Hey!”

“Now, I said!” His mom placed her hands on her hips.

“Okay, fine.”

Roland glared at Sal a moment, stalked out, and stopped in shock. Surely, he’d cleaned more than this. Not that he had a choice with starvation hanging over his head, so he scrubbed away at the floor, again. His stomach grumbled, again.

It took two more trips to finish the hall. Sal had almost finished eating, and Roland scrutinized his meal to make sure his best friend hadn’t pilfered it. He glanced over at Sal, who stared back at him with an overtly innocent expression on his face.

Oh, he definitely pilfered.

Roland growled a little at Sal, sheltered his plate with one arm, and dug in with another.

“Slower! You are not an animal.”

Roland slowed his intake just enough to balance his mother’s demands with hunger’s clawing insistence.

The clack of knife against wood could be heard from further in the kitchen as his mom prepared for the night’s meal. It was early, but she’d adopted a habit of prepping before she headed off to her job with the town council so his dad could cook when he got home.

The sound of chopping stopped the moment the front door closed. His mom walked carefully toward the kitchen door, knife in hand. Just as she approached, a large barrel-chested man with thick arms rounded the corner, towering over everyone in the room.

“Dad!”

Roland’s dad looked over at his mom and eyed the knife. His eyes lit up with mirth.

“I promise,” he said slowly, “I took off my boots at the door.”

She dropped her arm and let him walk over and wrap his arms around her. Her tiny frame almost disappeared in those arms, but she visibly relaxed.

She pushed him off her. “What happened?”

“Nothing to worry over. Some argument with a Royal over the logging rights. Mayor’s dealing with it, I think, but they’re calling the council to discuss.”

“Youlson?” his mother asked.

“No. That’s the problem. This one believes he’s got rights.”

She rubbed her forehead. “That could be a problem.”

His father waved it off. “Royals always compete like this. To be honest, I’d not care which one takes our lumber just so long as they pay for it.”

His mother nodded, but her worry only deepened. “When’s the council?”

“In a bell; they're giving the Royal a tour now. If you don’t mind, I’d like to be there.”

“That should be fine.” She made her way back to the kitchen. “You eat yet?”

“No chance. Had to help shut down the plant, else I’d have come sooner.”

“Okay, I’ll fix you a plate. We can head to the hall after you eat.”

Roland’s father nodded and squeezed himself into a vacant chair as he watched his wife work distractedly with the food. Roland squirmed a little as he ate.

“Yalinda, it’ll be fine,” his dad said. “You’re a respected member of the council, perfectly capable of smoothing any misunderstanding.”

She snorted. “That’s not enough, Jast. Royals don’t give a damn about our council. You know that.”

“I don’t mean to suggest this isn’t serious, love. Just that you’re perfectly capable of handling it. The Royals have to deal with someone, the council is best to handle it, and your the best of the council.”

Yalinda said nothing as she continued to prepare food.

Roland slowed his intake; he could feel his father's eyes on him, but he refused to look up. Suddenly, every one of his injuries felt glaringly visible; they practically screamed their presence to the room. He absently tongued his split lip.

When his father finally spoke, his voiced filled the room with a clean baritone.

"What it good? Was it right?"

Roland looked up to find his father staring at him. He dipped his head.

"Did you win?"

Roland's eyes dropped, then darted back and forth in thought. After a few seconds, he raised them; then he dipped his head again.

His father held Roland's gaze; the silence stretched. Finally, he jerked his head down; respect was in his eyes; a smile just touched his lips.

A plate of food slammed down in front of him, startling both father and son and earning a yelp from Sal, whose eyes grew wide. A mug of ale came next and spilled Yalinda's displeasure over the food. She held it down and glared at her husband; he met her with mirth, his lips pressed firmly into a tightly suppressed smile.

Sal stared intently at his plate, though it was clean. Roland also found sudden interest in cleaning his plate, though he stopped tasting the food.

After a literal lifetime, Yalinda harumped a growl-like sound and pushed herself off the mug, spilling even more of the ale over her husband's food. Jast watched her walk away, mirth still in his eyes, before he picked up the mug and sipped it lightly.

"We saw soldiers!"

Both Roland and his father looked over at Sal in surprise; his father put down the mug.

"Did you now?"

Sal whipped his head up and down. "They were at the inn."

Jast chuckled. "That would be the appropriate place for them."

He speared a piece of meat with his fork and brought it to his mouth, but paused before eating it. He looked back up to the boys, his brow furrowed.

"Only soldiers?"

Roland shrugged as he chewed but Sal nodded firmly.

"How many?"

Roland swallowed. "Like, maybe twenty?"

"Twelve." Sal corrected.

"Whatever." Roland shrugged and got back to the much more important business of stuffing his belly.

Roland's mom sat down with her own plate of food and shared a look with her husband.

"You two stay away from them," she said.

Roland grunted a non-committal noise. Sal said nothing, but his eyes darted and his brow was drawn down.

"And the Royal, never go near them; better they never see you," Roland's father added.

Roland repeated his previous noise and scooped the last of his food into his mouth. He stared at the plate in discontent, then opened his mouth to ask for more.

“Why don’t you two go back out and have a few adventures?” Roland’s dad said.

Roland looked at his dad, then back to his plate, and finally back to his dad. He licked his lips.

“But don't go too far,” his mother added.

He gave his mother an exasperated look. He wasn’t stupid; he knew where the line was. People who went too far didn’t come back.

“And stay away from the Whitewoods.”

Roland turned his eyes away. He was really bad at ignoring that particular rule. His mom grabbed his arm.

“I’m serious.”

“Your mother’s right, Roland. I’ve known men badly hurt by those trees, or worse.”

Roland gave a reluctant nod.

“Let me hear you say it,” she insisted.

He rolled his eyes. “I won’t go too far.”

“And?”

He sighed. “And I’ll stay away from the Whitewoods,” he lied.

She narrowed her eyes but released his arms. He almost made up before she grabbed him again.

"That lip looks bad."

Roland froze. Uh oh.

Sal stood up suddenly. "I ah... have something I need to do."

Roland scrunched his face at his best friend, now turned traitor. "Like what!?"

Sal gathered his plate. "Just something," he mumbled.

Sal kept his head down as he rushed to clean his plate. Roland tried to give him a furious look as he left but Sal's eyes were firmly averted. He almost ran out of the kitchen.

Roland whipped his head around, desperate for any sign of help, but there was no mercy in his mother's eyes. He turned a pleading gaze to his father, but his father ate as though he were the only one in the room, a suppressed smile his only give away.

Roland's shoulders dropped in despair; he groaned. "Noooo..."

His mother flashed him a wicked smile. "I'll get my sewing kit."
