# 19 | Soldier [Sal]

Sal scrubbed his shoes, his motions practiced and precise, using a rag he'd stolen from Roland's kitchen. They weren't great shoes. The leather was a little too thin, the soles worn uneven — not all by him — and the laces not quite frayed, but only barely. There were stains from mud and scratches from play that should never have been allowed, yet he couldn't bring himself to regret those.

He stopped near the toe of the second shoe and frowned; the stitching had broke. He fingered it, tried to rub it back in place, then settled for pressing it under the fold. Over time, it would come undone if he didn't find a way to repair it.

He slipped his feet in and laced the shoes, careful to make sure the length of each tie matched the other.

He stood and thoughtfully regarded the travesty of what he wore. Roland's clothes were well made, much better than anything he owned, but they were little more than vast swaths of billowing brown cloth on him. He briefly considered making a trip to his house and adding a few strategic stitches, but that risked his father and he didn't know how Roland's mom would react if he returned tailored clothes. He couldn't alienate her; Roland was his only friend.

The sleeves stopped just shy of his finger tips; he carefully rolled them back by two folds, ensuring the crisp lines on each matched their counterpart.

His pant legs were worse; the backs of them would curl under his heel and wear holes. Unacceptable. He knelt down and rolled each leg up by three folds, then stood and looked down in dissatisfaction. He looked like a country bumpkin.

He knelt back down, unrolled the pant legs, and then rolled them up inward. It took much longer and several attempts to get them to match. He pinched, then rubbed the bottom creases using his fingernails until it was crisp or, at least as much as he could make it. When he was done, the pant cuff almost looked normal, perhaps, if one ignored the obvious "thickness" around his ankle the roll produced.

He stood again, only a little less dissatisfied. His next matter to attend was his shirt. Most people in town wore their shirts untucked, relying on cut of cloth to provide style or, at least, what passed as such in a small town.Really, they were just lazy. The soldiers, though, wore their shirts tucked in, but then they also wore coats.

Sal tucked his in.

He reached behind with both hands and pinched the shirt near the sides. Slowly, he rubbed his fingers in a way that pulled the front of the shirt in, cinching the billowing cloth into two large creases tucked into his back.

He tightened a thin leather belt, one much better than he was used to — his own was cloth — but also too large. The size wasn't a big deal if he could keep it from dangling. It forced him to use a notch too tight, only a little uncomfortable, but the end tucked into the second belt loop, if only barely. At least he needn't worry about his shirt coming untucked.

Finally, he picked up the rag he'd stolen and folded it neatly into a square. He should go back in and clean it, but then Roland would never let him leave and Sal had no desire to watch Roland's mom sew her son's flesh closed. Besides, he needed to leave.

He carefully placed the rag next to the door and hoped Roland's mom would understand.

Larstead was nestled in a narrow valley, hidden between steep hills. It was long, as though someone had taken a normal town and squeezed it through a narrow hole, causing the buildings to explode northward from there. The only road into town was first pinned down by the Inn, then split in a v as space allowed. Both subsequent roads, none of which were named, split again further down. From there, they meandered into the valley until they ceased being roads at all. Roland's home was on the western side of the western most v just beyond the second split.

Sal walked around the back of the house and onto the cobblestone out front at just after two in the afternoon. It would take at most a ten minute walk to make it to the inn, if Sal kept a brisk pace. He balanced this against the summer sun; he would not allow himself to walk into the inn flushed and sweaty.

Twelve minutes later he stood on the porch. His resolve faltered. Laurice would be in there, and her father. The noise from within fought its way out in a blended, boisterous sound uncommon to this time of day. If he continued on only a few hundred paces, he could wait for Roland by their path into the mountains. He could forget this stupid idea; he could forget his stupid dream; he could be a coward. Lot's of people were cowards; he knew this; his father was one.

The door burst open to reveal a man with a flat face and pinched lips. He was a local logger, though Sal couldn't recall the name. The man took a deep breath, shook his head, and walked past Sal without seeing him. Sal rushed in before before the door could shut, before his courage could fail.

Sound and smell assaulted him, but it was the smell that caught him unaware. There were the normal scents: food, ale, and sweat mixed with must and spicy sweetness. But shoved in was a sour note, one of piss, and that made no sense. Mr. Henderson would never allow his inn to smell like piss. Why the man would allow this with a Royal in town was beyond Sal, but he was not here to critique the man.

His eyes were drawn to Laurice of their own accord. She worked behind the bar today, which was unusual; she normally served the guests. Her face was tense as she wiped down the bar with hard jerky motions, as though the wood personally offended her. Sal quickly shifted his eyes lest she notice his stare. Her father appeared with bowls of stew and walked toward the soldiers with a stiff gate, his jaw clenched.

The solders were relaxed, their lances propped between tables and chairs, their coats unbuttoned. Several stomaches pressed out against constraining buttons to make gaps that revealed brown flesh beneath. Their voices were slurred, their eyes blurry, their faces flushed.

A hand pressed on his shoulder and for the second time today Sal froze, unable to keep the terror from rising. He suppressed it and looked, knowing he would see the older soldier, fearing he would not.

"I'm glad you came," the soldier said, "come with me."

He led Sal toward the back and up the stairs, which led to rentable rooms. There were eight doors, four on each side, barely lit by the shaded light let in from windows on each end of the hall. The last room on the far left was larger, taking up space the opposite side had reserved for the stairs.

Inside was stuffed a bed, a chest, and a foldable desk which looked to have seen better days. On it were a scattering of papers held down by a single flask.

Sal walked in and snapped to attention, just has his father had drilled him: back straight, chin up, eyes out, shoulders back but loose, arms straight down, palms facing his thighs, feet together.

The soldier sat across the table in a fold-out chair, grabbed the flask, and leaned back. The flask touched his lips but then paused when he noticed Sal. He blinked slowly, put the flask down, and leaned forward. He frowned and took in Sal's appearance, starting from the top and working their way slowly down to his shoes, where they lingered.

Was he staring at the broken thread? Sal shoved the thought aside before it drove him to look down, which he absolutely should not do.

What rank was the soldier? Captain, sergeant? Sal saw no insignia, though he wouldn't have known how to read it anyway. With almost a dozen soldiers under him, it was probably Sergeant.

The sergeant's eyes snapped up. "Recruit. Report."

Sal's heart jumped at the word recruit; then it fell straight into his stomach. Report... report what?

"Nothing to report, sir." He kept his words crisp and short.

"Nothing? Nothing at all?"

Sal thought furiously for thirteen seconds before he was rescued.

"Recruit," the sergeant drew out the word, "tell me about this... town."

"We sell lumber, sir."

"Drop the sir; it's too much."

"Yes, si... uh."

"So this lumber pays for your roads?"

Huh? "I guess so." Was something wrong with the roads?

"You guess, or you know?"

"I don't know, sir."

"Okay, _recruit_, when was the last time you saw the road paved?"

"Never, sir."

"Never?"

"No, sir."

"What did I say about calling me sir?"

Sal winced. "You said not to—"

"Right. How do you expect to be a soldier if you can't follow a simple order?"

"Force of habit sss ah... I won't do it again."

The man fell silent for thirteen seconds. It took every ounce of effort for Sal to not apologize, but if there's one thing he'd learned from his father, it was to never apologize in the military. You explain how you're going to change and accept the consequences.

"So when they build a new house, they don't add to the road?"

"No sir," _shit_, "ah... um, there's no need."

"And why is that?"

"The mayor sells them one of the empty ones."

"Empty... right, of course, the empty house just waiting to be filled. Okay, and the ones who can't?"

"They live in the standard Empire flats." Sir. He didn't say sir, he just thought it. That was probably fine.

The soldier sat back, revealing a slight paunch Sal hadn't noticed before. It made his coat look a size too small.

"What other Empire... standards are met?"

With that, the whole line of seemingly random questions suddenly made sense. Sal almost breathed out a sigh of relief but caught himself; sighs of relief were wholly inappropriate in the military.

"Every Empire standard has been met." Pride had crept into his voice, and he managed to not even think of the word 'sir'.

The soldier waved him on. "Elaborate."

Sal ran through his head what he knew of the standards, picking out what he figured was important.

"All homes have either running water or access to the bath house, per the regulations, ssss.... um, they also all have at least basic heating and lighting gravtech appliances. Those who can't afford a home have access to the flats for reasonable rates and it's not even half accupantsy. We have no homeless. All children are required to attend the school house three days a week, and I can personally attest the material meets all regulations."

Never mind that the reason he could "personally attest" to the school house was because one of those children was him. Sal had intentionally included several big, military words that he hoped would impress the man, although he wasn't certain he managed the word occupancy right. He was pretty sure it worked; the sergeant's mouth had slowly dropped open during the report.

"Flats..." The sergeant tasted the word, then his eyes narrowed. "How many flats?"

Sal had no idea. Several of the boys who taunted him lived in that area, so he avoided it. It was a two story building though, and the flats weren't all that large, maybe a bedroom attached to a combined kitchen and living room. A floor held maybe twenty flats? No, that wasn't right—

"Recruit, I asked you a—"

"Thirty, sir."

The sergeant slammed his hand down with one hand, scattering the papers onto the floor, though he caught the flask before it too fell. He got up, sending the chair over on its side, and paced back and forth in the space left between the desk and the bed.

"And that tit-sucking asshole's got most my men in tents. It's been a shit show from the start and it'll be..."

Sal missed the rest. He knew what came next; he knew what would happen. But if he could keep himself still, perfect, above reproach, the storm would pass over, him as untouchable as the cliffs against which any storm raged. His hands trembled; he pressed them into his outer thighs to hide it.

The sergeant picked up the chair, slammed it down, and practically fell into it. He leaned over and pressed his thumb and fingers into the bridge of his nose, muttering incomprehensible, angry words that Sal couldn't make out. After twenty three seconds, he released a slow breath and managed to get himself back under control. When he looked up, he seemed surprised Sal was standing there, still at attention no less.

His eyes flashed disgust. "You want to be a soldier?"

Sal straightened his back. "Yes, sir."

The sergeant scoffed, shook his head, then picked at something in his teeth.

"Meet me here tomorrow morning," he said through his thumb. "Dismissed."

"Don't you need my father's—"

"I said dismissed!"

Sal snapped out a crips salute and turned on his heel, earning an amused grunt. The sergeant was already tipping back the flask as he shut the door.
