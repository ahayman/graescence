# 90 | Epilogue

Rose was tired, though it wasn’t a physical thing. She’d long since ceased to physically tire, and even after days without sleep, days of endless exertion, she would barely feel the effects.

Yet this wasn’t days without sleep. It wasn’t even weeks. It had been years.

Too many years.

How, after centuries of living, a mere decade or so could drain her so much, was beyond her. Yet drained she was. Even her passion, that precious, slow-burning poison of vengeance she kept carefully hidden deep inside, had been robbed of much its warmth.

It just felt tired and worn, so very much like her self.

She didn’t need sleep as others did and hadn’t for a long time. It was a truth she’d long since grown accustomed to as one of the many advantages that the gift the gods had blessed her with. Gods that no one knew existed anymore, yet somehow guided all. Gods that terrified her, yet blessed her with immortality. Gods that allowed her to pursue her vengeance.

Yet her sleep was restless now, and her dreams troubled.

She couldn’t recall the inflection point, that one point in time when things had irrevocably veered off wrong, when she no longer thought of herself as safe, when fear had begun to leech the fire from her passion. Yet in retrospect, it’d been draining her life for some time now.

It was not the gift that had failed her. It was as it always had been, a sustaining energy latticed throughout her body. But it could not battle what wormed through her mind and devoured her passion.

This was all hidden, as it should be. There was not a soul who knew these things, and never would there be. Her mask had long since been perfected, from her face down to every twitch and gesture of her body. She didn’t reveal weakness, ever.

But there was not a soul near her, not within so many leagues as to redefine isolation itself. So she slumped in her chair as she pressed her fingers into the bridge of her brow and drug them out to her temples, repeating the process over and over. She stared at the floor with unfocused eyes. Her hand periodically blocked her view as it continued to carve stress from her brow, yet her eyes never bothered to change their focus.

It had all seemed so perfect. The perfect opportunity, the perfect plan, the perfect boy. It had started out so well, and it should have continued just as well.

She’d broken dozens over the centuries until time blurred the true number. Men, women, children, it didn’t matter. She’d long since perfected her art, long ago learned what people could and could not take, cataloged their types, knew their weaknesses and how to exploit them. She knew when and how they would break, where the cracks would form, and exactly how to use those cracks to reform the person. Once broken, they were malleable, pliant, and so readily built into her plans.

And in the end, they always worshipped her for it.

But he didn’t worship her, and that made no sense.

The boy had not broken, not even once. So she had continued to ply the pressure, ever more of it, escalating ever over the years, until she found herself straining to simply maintain it.

She kept expecting it, that moment when he would finally crack. Oh, he had outbursts, and they’d been terrifying slips of control that forced her to face her own mortality. The sheer power the boy commanded was nothing she’d ever before witnessed, ever thought possible. He could end her with an errant sneeze.

Yet he should have broken.

Power or no, he was still just a boy. While she’d had projects fail before, it hadn’t happened in so long as to render the possibility moot. She’d _perfected_ the process. Her methods were inviolate. Even when they failed, always there had been some missed external factor, usually someone she’d failed to account for. The only possible way for him to have remained whole was to rely on someone else, and yet there literally could be none of that here. _Here_ was possibly one of the most isolated places one could find, guarded by some of the fiercest creatures on the planet. Even she only dared live here because she could travel, and there was something about this valley that discouraged the greater beasts.

Her fingers dug deeply into her temples. The boy shouldn’t have just broken, he should have been a puddle, a weeping malleable mass after all she’d put him through. He should look at her with wonder and terror, eager to please her every whim. It terrified her in the deepest parts of her psyche that he’d not just remained unbroken but somehow grown stronger in the process.

The longer it went on, the more crept in doubt, the more wormed in dread that she’d taken on more than she could handle. The doubt ate at her confidence and eroded it until she became confident he would not break, that one day, he would turn on her and end her for her many sins with barely more than a thought.

And so her perfect plan had been revealed faulty by the most unexpected weakness, her. It rankled her to admit it, and perhaps that had drawn everything out further than wise. But she’d not lived so long without admitting her mistakes, few though they were, and she’d come to realize her plan simply wasn’t going to work, at least in its current form.

All good plans have contingencies, and it had taken her years to set this one up. It was a risky alternative, imperfect as it relied on so many others but necessary. The boy simply couldn’t stay here any longer. Had he broken, she could have simply commanded him, and it would be done. Now, she would have to do it by proxy. Her only consolation was that her real goal was still attainable. She wasn’t sure she could have accepted that loss.

The boy had been gone for over a week, not the longest of his hunts but very nearly so. He should have taken the bait by now, but she would not clear out his room until she was certain.

She itched to clear out his room. She itched to rid the whole house of every last shred of him.

She got up suddenly and walked outside.

It was morning, the sky crystal with not a cloud to mar it. She took a deep breath and relished the air’s cold bite.

A distraction, that’s what she needed.

She walked out to the center of her training ground and released that breath slowly. At a thought, she summoned her sword to her self, her mind unconsciously forming all the required surfaces with hardly more effort than it took to breathe.

Sword in hand, she began to work through some of the more advanced forms she knew. She spun and twisted her body in ways that most wouldn’t consider human. She moved quicker than possible, shifting stance and position with a grace that drive most duelists to tears and envy. Her body became a weapon of grace, with not even a twitch of muscle out of place. Halfway through, she stopped and lowered the tip of the sword to the ground.

Dread still clung to her like a shadow.

She formed an edge this time and started up her forms again. It was a bad idea to practice forms with an edged weapon. One slip could render an arm or even life. Yet she needed this danger to distract her from the worms of doubt that ate her soul. Slowly but surely, the practiced motions conjoined with imminent danger and forced her mind to clear. Part of her knew all the dread and doubt would return in short order, but for now, it was a reprieve she would take.

She was in the middle of a complex maneuver when she gasped at an assault of energy of the like she’d never known. The sky brightened to a painful degree, and within seconds, she more felt than heard the earth crack, followed by a blast of wind.

The world could not have broken. She knew that it wasn’t possible, but it was the only sense her mind could make of the experience. She looked around as all trees, including the Whitewoods, waved back and forth.

And then it was gone.

The trees settled, the wind and sounds died out, and the forest grew silent. After some time, chirps, creaks, rustles, and cracks began to fill the forest again, slow, tentative, until the forest sounded once again as a forest should, silent with all the noise that entailed. The sky remained clear, Ionia remained somewhere up above. The earth hadn’t shattered, though her mind still demanded it must have.

Rose stood up from her knees and unclenched her hands. She looked down to where she dropped her sword and admired the exquisite design of the relic, one of the last of her family’s heirlooms along with its brother, which sat unused in the house.

Her family.

She closed her eyes to remember, weighed down with the knowledge that she alone retained it. Their very memory had been deliberately and systematically wiped from the earth. So she remembered, brought it all back into herself, and bolstered her courage. She was the last of the true Rotakans, and she would not be outdone by a mere boy.

She opened her eyes and with resolve, began to form the shapes required to travel. Dozens, then hundreds, of shapes took form, folding in on themselves over and over again, only to be added to by more patterns. After a minute or two, space itself began to warp, and still she continued.

With an anchor — of which she had many — this process would barely take seconds. But without she was forced to manage every detail herself, hundreds of them, all at the same time, and slowly build up the necessary construct to take her where she desired. It’d taken her over a century and several near-death experiences to master it. She’d killed all involved in training her, and of those who knew she could travel, precious few knew she could manage it without an anchor.

Once satisfied the gate would hold, she stepped through into a world of destruction. Trees, brush, boulders, and even the Whitewoods had all been flattened, as though some giant had carved them off the surface and pressed them back down into the exposed loam of the forest floor. Small fires cast smoke in an ill-fated attempt to darken the sky, though none of those flames seemed capable of taking hold amidst all the dirt, stone, and remains of shattered Whitewoods. The destruction felt a stark contrast to the clear sky above, like it should have been cloudy, overcast, and dark to complement the scene before her.

She picked her way through, carefully, so as to avoid any errant Whitewood that might spear her. The aftermath of the desolation had left a veritable minefield of them scattered about to splash their brilliant red leaves among the detritus.

The chaos of destruction carried within it a clear pattern that pointed back to a source. She could see neither the end of it nor the other side. To her right, she could see a distant line of standing trees that might be an edge to the destruction. It seemed evident it was a cone of destruction that emanated from some source, and so it was toward that source that she carefully picked her way through the detritus.

After almost an hour, she stopped and narrowed her eyes at a sight her mind refused to process.

From a distance, she’d almost mistaken it for a felled Whitewood, or perhaps an oddly shaped boulder. The shape of it became clear as she drew nearer, but her mind kept rejecting the form, insisting to her that it must be something else. Yet the closer she got, the more she simply couldn’t deny that she was, in fact, staring at a massive serpent’s head.

The crown of its head towered over her own. She almost could have walked into its eye socket without bending over. Its scales were white, but as she moved, she caught slight shifts and changes of color within them. As massive as it was, this thing must have hidden well with scales like that.

After a few minutes, she abandoned her examination of the head and allowed her eyes to wander down its body. The body ended only a dozen paces beyond, likely disintegrated from the blast. She tried to extrapolate just how large the whole body would be, but her imagination failed her, partly because she had trouble imagining an animal so massive in the first place. Scaling up a garden snake didn’t exactly work well in this case.

She tore away her gaze to move on, but a glint of light pulled her attention back.

She turned back and waved her head back and forth until she caught the glint again. That wasn’t from a scale. She raised a hand and formed a shape before she paused and looked at the head.

It was dead, obviously.

It was dead, but she couldn’t escape the sense of dread that accompanied any thought of disturbing the great beast.

She shook off the feeling and pulled the object out and to her person without further hesitation. Her heart skipped. She closed her eyes and forced her breathing into an even rhythm.

It was _her_ knife suspended before her.

“Fool boy,” she growled as she snapped the blade from the air.

Her hand trembled with whitened knuckles around the hilt. What had possessed the boy to fight something like this? He’d jeopardized everything for what? To prove that he could do it?

She shook her head and forced herself into calm.

It made no sense, and when something doesn’t make sense, she’d learned to always reanalyze it. No mystery cannot be unraveled by time, patience, and the endless application of thought.

He’d ever reached too far in his hunts, but this was another level entirely. She just couldn’t believe him to be dumb enough to fight something like this unless... unless he felt he had no choice.

She looked over to the massive head in confusion and pinched her lips. Had it threatened the expedition? A few people in the woods should be well below the notice of beast such as this, yet it was the only scenario that made any sense.

She brought the knife up, looked at it a moment, and let out a huff through her nose. Might as well fight a lion with a needle.

And yet so he had.

She turned her gaze up to the beast’s head, then continued to take in again the destruction around her. She forced herself to face the obvious truth.

The boy was dead and with him the best of her plans.

With that thought came a profound sense of relief that was yet laced with unease. She turned her attention toward her nearest anchor, her only home in this place.

He must be dead.

It was simply impossible to survive something like this. She looked back in the direction from where the blast originated and sighed quietly to herself. She needed to know for sure, or she would never rest well again.

She once again began to pick her way toward the epicenter of a cone of destruction that appeared to have no end.

It took over an hour before the detritus became small enough to leave her capable of walking a normal stride. The further in she walked, the smaller the pieces became until she was literally walking on the dust of vaporized wood, stone, dirt, and very likely flesh.

She tried not to overthink how the wind picked up that dust and swirled it around in the air.

She could finally see distant trees on either side. They funneled her toward a center that yet remained just beyond her sight, obscured as it was by a horizon that wavered.

It grew hotter the further she walked, which answered why the ground seemed to ripple in her vision. Before long, her feet strode on a hard surface.

She stopped and knelt. Obsidian, or just glass? It had a transparent quality to it streaked with black, almost as though obsidian had mixed with glass. She tapped her knife against the ground as the heat of it assaulted her face. The sound was as metal on glass, but that answered no questions. She stood up and looked around. Whatever it was, she was confident extreme heat had caused it.

She swallowed hard and walked yet again toward the center. It was hot enough now that she considered removing her coat. Occasionally, a cold wisp of a breeze would kiss her face just enough to remind her that yes, it was still winter.

The end was in sight, of a sort. She could see the treetops ahead, but they looked cut off, as though someone had sucked them most way into the ground. The further in she walked, the more the trees began to disappear into the terrain ahead. It took her some time to realize she’d been on a slow decline, and gazed not a horizon but a cliff of the same obsidian she walked on. A little beyond that would be the tree line, slowly blocked from her view by her increasing angle against the cliff. It blended in so well with the ground that she still had trouble seeing it for what it was, her mind waffling its perception between cliff and horizon.

She stopped when she realized she could never reach her goal this way. Already she had begun to sweat, itself a somewhat odd occurrence even if it wasn’t winter. Supposing she could survive the heat, the cliff was clearly made of the same substance upon which she walked, and she had no way to climb it.

She turned to her right and walked parallel until she arrived at the edge of the destruction, which was itself a continuation of the cliff as it wrapped around in a cone-like shape. She had to back-track until the cliff was shallow enough for her to climb up. Once up, she jogged through what had become a surprisingly normal forest only a few dozen paces from the cliff’s edge.

It occurred to her that she’d been walking in the future bed of a decent sized lake.

She arrived at the top of the cliff to find the swirled remains of a different sort of destruction. Clearly, the vast majority of energy had been directed outward, yet what had leaked back around had been more than enough to burn the ground clean of any vegetation.

It was the ground itself, though, that stole her attention. In it was etched an intricate and beautiful pattern of lines and curves. They wrapped around the edge of the cliff and intersected with one another in a complex dance that tickled her memory. She stared at the pattern for a long time before her mind was able to drudge up whatever distant knowledge it had locked up beneath time’s inexorable march.

She laughed out a delighted and surprised noise into the silence.

It was a refraction pattern. Battle magic. A very old and long-extinct study on the interaction of surfaces with one another. It posited an underlying presumption that someone with superior knowledge could defeat another with greater power by merely knowing how gravic waves interacted with one another. Their entirely philosophy and even math revolved around patterns such as this.

It was a simple philosophy of subtlety over sheer force, though practitioners were rumored to be capable of unraveling another’s shapes by resonance alone. It was an attractive idea, but the underlying math was brutally complicated and took decades to understand, much less put into use.

The subject matter had only begun to be explored in her own time, but her family’s library had once held books under lock from an ancient era when the subject had been highly studied. And here before her, written into the very surface of the earth, was a mathematical proof that she suspected most from that long-dead era would have sold their own mothers for. All it had taken was the interaction of god-like amounts of energy.

Her breath caught in realization as she returned her eyes to the cliff.

It was a shield.

The boy had created a shield, the size and strength of which she could barely comprehend. And it had held, it must have, against an equally powerful opponent, a serpent the size of a large palace, which had near been obliterated. The boy had simply died from the mere refraction of energies involved.

She wondered if she would find a body.

She followed the pattern slowly toward the center of the cliff, careful to memorize as much of the complex proof as she could. It was at least something of a consolation prize. She would need to come back later with pen and paper, but the pattern was intriguing, and there was no guarantee she could return. She rarely went beyond her valley and for excellent reasons, given the size of that serpent.

She found no dead body at the center, but she did find an abrupt cessation of the pattern that bordered a small patch of burnt green. A second shield, even after the massive one?

She scanned the tree line but saw nothing. She pursed her lips and tapped her foot as she thought it through.

There should be _something_ around here. The boy didn’t simply dissolve into nothing, though had he been on the other side of the blast, she might have believed just that.

She walked toward the tree line, which was still a ways back. The refraction lines lessened as she walked, and then disappeared entirely without any clear demarcation. They’d simply faded as the energy dissipated.

With nothing more to memorize, her eyes scanned the forest edge fervently for any sign of a body. Before long, she’d locked onto something that lay within the shadows cast further in from the treeline.

She angled to approach it.

His back was to her, and he lay motionless of the forest floor, with not even the rise of his chest to betray life. As far as she could tell, his body was whole, which she found more than just a little remarkable. More notable was the three knives embedded into his back. Two of them were hers, one was not.

She suspected she knew who owned the foreign knife. What she could not reason out was why these knives were embedded in him. She could not conceive of any circumstance where not only that girl’s blade, but also her own would somehow come to this arrangement, and she refused to believe that the serpent could wield knives.

She moved around the boy and was only mildly surprised to see two more knives, one in his shoulder, the other his leg. His brace was empty, which she found faintly annoying. Those knives were far from cheap.

She knelt down and paused at the sight of his face now that she was close enough to pierce the shadows. It was horribly burnt, blistered, and charred. She shuddered as she saw much of his clothes had burned, and every bit of exposed skin was in the same condition. His head was splotched with patches of hair, burnt skin, and dirt.

In a rare moment of grace, she genuinely hoped he hadn’t been conscious for that.

She stole her nerves and pressed her finger against his throat to confirm the obvious, only to snatch her hand back in surprise.

The boy was very much _not_ dead.

She stumbled back a few paces as her mind struggled to reorient itself to this impossible reality. Over the past several hours, she’d slowly reconciled herself to the frustrating reality that she’d permanently lost over a decade of her life to the boy’s idiocy. More staggering was the loss of what she could _do_ with that boy.

That loss came with palpable relief, and a part of her had written it off for the best. Some weapons were simply too dangerous to wield.

Yet now her world had inverted to give her another chance at an opportunity that required her to handle a weapon that could tear out the sides of mountains to create lakes.

Oh, but she was torn.

She couldn’t just leave him lying her for someone else to find or beast to consume, yet she loathed the idea of taking him back in.

She turned and scanned the forest as her mind churned through possibilities and plans.

Presumably, the expedition was still out there, though she had no idea where and no intention of risking her own life to find them. She flirted with the idea of killing the boy, but she wasn’t entirely certain that was even possible anymore. Even if it were, he lay there like a feast to her hungering vengeance. She simply could not give up the opportunity.

She closed her eyes and pressed her fingers into the bridge of her brow. Good plans have contingencies. When those fail, you simply create a new one. Perhaps this could be salvaged, especially if the expedition survived, and if the attachment between the boy and girl were strong enough.

She snorted to herself in amusement at the thought. She’d give her left arm if those two weren’t bound like glue. She narrowed her eyes and looked at him anew. Had he done this for that girl? Had he clawed success from a monster and blasted out a large lake, just for her?

Gods, she hoped so because devotion like that was valuable. It could be used, exploited, and would make it that much easier to exact her vengeance. More importantly, it meant she’d done something right over the years. Perhaps he would never worship her, but he didn’t need to. So long as that devotion existed, she could manipulate it.

Her eyes trailed over the boy’s form as she nodded to herself. Yes, it would take another few years, but she’d survived him this long.

She wrapped the boy in a complex surface, careful to keep the knives pinned precisely where they were. It would take time to remove them properly, and she didn’t want to waste another moment in this desolation. She lifted the boy a few feet off the ground and turned toward her nearest anchor, its presence never far from her mind. She almost started to form a gate when she caught motion from her periphery.

She turned, and her blood turned to water.

Outside the tree line, backed by the cliff and desolation beyond, was a girl with ebony skin and astonishing green eyes. Her head was surrounded by a halo of hair that seemed to blend in with the desolation behind her.

Rose blinked several times before her mind would accept that reality itself was twisting and warping around the girl. The girl was ripping apart reality itself, and that shattered reality grew larger with every second.

Rose had never before felt so insignificant, like a child who stood blithely before a tornado. Yet it was the girl’s eyes that drove terror into the deepest parts of her soul, for those eyes were consumed with a jealous rage that danced with insanity.

The shattered reality surged toward Rose.

She had never formed a gate so quick as she had at that moment. She shoved the boy through and practically dove after him an instant later, while behind, her gate was torn apart viciously by the shattered pieces of an insane girl’s rage.
