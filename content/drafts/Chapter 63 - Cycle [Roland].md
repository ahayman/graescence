# 63 | Cycle [Roland]

The brush had thorns, because of course they did. And these weren't just little stubs either. They were long, wickedly curved, and they scoffed at the paltry defense of his clothes. They snagged and tore skin, then required utmost care to remove without tearing large holes in his clothes.

It wasn't impossible to make progress, but difficult without scratching his skin off. He tried using his sword once, but pain lanced his arm and left him feeling dizzy. So he pushed, grunted and cursed his way through and still found himself falling further and further behind even as he accumulated an impressive collection of small scratches all over his body.

Ellie simply walked through the brush in a leisurely stroll.

"You're not very stealthy," she shot him a look over her shoulder.

"You're not helping."

She stopped and turned, looking at him curiously.

"I'd not have thought you, such a mighty hunter, would be thwarted by mere brush."

He raised his wounded arm and glared at her, but faltered as the pain subsided. He left it raised and tried to keep his glare, completely aware he looked like an idiot.

"Oh, it's hurting?"

"Yes, it's hurting," he hissed through clenched teeth. He didn't bother pointing out the countless scratches.

"Hmm, we don't have time to change the dressing. That would take hours. But you do know why it hurts, right?"

He glanced at the wrap. That took hours? "It hurts because a grek clawed me."

She laughed. "That's true, but not what I mean." She gave him a curious look, and for a moment, he felt like a schoolboy before his teacher. "Okay, so your arm is throbbing, yes? And it's throbbing to the beat of your heart?"

"Of course it is." Dwelling on the pain wasn't helping his mood.

"Right..."

She seemed to wait for him to have an epiphany, but he decided to glare at her with his arm in the air, which made him feel better no matter how stupid he looked.

After a moment she shook her head in wonder. "Right, okay. So if you had less blood in your arm, maybe it would hurt less?"

"Did you... just suggest I slit my wrists?"

"What? No, don't be silly. Death might be the ultimate cure, but it's not a good one." She huffed and seemed to give up. "Why don't you just use your gravics to keep the blood pressure in your arm stable, or even lessen it?"

The idea never occurred to him. He'd never heard of anyone who tried or even talked about it. It certainly wasn't something he'd ever tried to do before. Rose had never mentioned it, but he knew there was a lot that Rose hadn't taught him yet.

He brought his arm down to look at it, causing the pain to intensify. He closed his eyes and searched inwardly for the threads of energy that were normally active when he was using his gravics. Of course, he couldn't find them since he wasn't using that energy for anything. Always in the past, he could trace the energy flows through his body, but they needed to be active for him to sense. He briefly tried pushing the energy, but nothing happened with nowhere for it to go.

He opened his eyes and shook his head. "I don't know how."

"Huh, wow, okay... uh, so since you closed your eyes I assume you can sense gravics in your body?" He frowned at her tone, which had a patient, slight condescension one might use on a child.

"No, I can only see those when I'm actively using it."

"You're not always using it?" Definitely condescension.

"What would I use it for?"

"To strengthen your body, of course. Otherwise, the energy just sits there, doing nothing."

"I didn't even know that was a thing."

"You don't know how to cycle?"

He let out an annoyed sound. “No, I don't know how to 'cycle.' I've never even heard of it.”

"How odd, I just figured with amazing things you do."

He growled at her. His arm throbbed, he was irritated, antsy to get back home, and Ellie was getting under his skin. Conversations with her had a way of careening out of control and what usually would be amusing was just frustrating now.

He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and pushed down the frustration. "Can you teach me?"

"Sure!"

She walked off into the brush and then her head disappeared suddenly. He gave a nasty look in her direction.

“Coming?”

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, again, to push down the frustration. It didn’t help.

He pushed through the brush into a small clearing of stone and dirt. Ellie was seated cross-legged on the only raised section of stone available, forcing Roland to sit down in the dirt below her. It made for a very teacher-student feel to it, which might have annoyed him except it felt good to sit.

"Okay, so you can feel the energy when you use it, correct?"

He nodded and begun to pick at the wrap again. It had started to itch from the sweat he’d accumulated over the last hour or so. “Yeah, they're like a thousand little threads that pull together."

"Good,” she nodded enthusiastically, “seeing those is normally the hard part."

"Okay then, so what—"

"So what you _want_ to do is try moving the energy between different parts of your body, then cycle the energy back to its source. The easiest way to learn is to push it out of one hand, then pull it in the other. You lose a lot of energy once it leaves the body, but it's the easiest way to learn. Once you have the energy moving between your two hands, you can focus on completing the cycle in your body. Your goal is to basically have a continuous circle of energy."

He was taken back a little by her instruction and how different it was from Rose, who always gave him only a short explanation — or no explanation — and then let him figure out the rest. Ellie seemed willing to dump everything on him at once.

He placed his hand a few fingers apart and rested his forearms on his legs. He tried to push the energy out of his good hand, but nothing happened. It still felt like the energy had nowhere to go. He then tried to pull with his opposite hand, but there was nothing to draw the energy from. He tried doing both at the same time, but his mind was having difficulty, preferring one or the other. It should be simple, especially since his sword pretty much did exactly what she described, but as usual, it proved much more difficult in practice.

"Take your time, no hurry."

He narrowed his eyes and started to say something sarcastic but then thought better of it. He'd only end up encouraging her to derail the conversation, and that was the last thing he wanted now.

"Oh, and don't let it destabilize or really bad things will happen."

Okay, that's not ominous at all. He shook his head and returned his attention to the task.

It took maybe an hour before he managed to get the energy to flow between his hands. It felt very slippery, and he had to continually make adjustments to keep it under control. It was like he was using a new muscle he never knew he had. He could tell that he was wasting energy, but he also noticed his arm felt better, although that could just be from resting.

With energy flowing, he could trace the flows in his body. Each hand was a rough mirror of the other, though the flows through his injured arm had noticeable disruptions around his wounds. Once again, he tried to trace the flows in his arm only to lose them before he reached his elbow. If he forced through more energy, he could trace them a little further up, but that tactic was a losing battle.

A better tactic would be to manipulate the individual threads, something he learned to do with all the toys Rose threw at him. But it took a lot more concentration than simply forcing more energy, or he might have started with that.

Slowly, he consolidated the threads and fed them back into a single stream that pushed further into his body. He struggled with his wounds, though. The streams wanted to go around the injury, which made them difficult to control. He tried to move the threads into the wounds and then gasped as it felt like someone had poured ice water into them.

“Oh yeah, you might want to be careful about where you direct that energy."

“Could have used that warning a few seconds ago.”

“Hmm…. you can heal faster using the cycle, but it'll hurt... like, a lot. Better to gently flow the energy around the edges. That only tingles a bit, and you'll still heal faster than normal."

At least that was useful advice, if a little late.

He closed his eyes and continued to manipulate the threads of energy. After another hour, he had managed to barely connect the two strands of energy, though he had to concentrate to prevent it from getting away from him. It took some time before he felt comfortable that it would stay in place.

"What's next?"

"You got it? Really... huh, wow, that was quicker than I thought."

"Barely, but they're connected."

"Okay, the next part will feel weird. Take the hand you're pushing from and place it on your chest. No, not there, it must be under the shirt on your bare skin. Yes there... good. Now, push the cycle into your chest. Just be careful. You really, really don't want to lose control of it."

She was right, it was weird, although somewhat similar. Since the energy never left his body, it took almost no effort to create. Yet resistance helped control, and without it, the energy squirmed and writhed. It took a bit before he got the handle of it.

Armed with this new knowledge, he began a cycle through his good arm, brought it up into his shoulder, and then back down to where it started. He had trouble weaving the energy around the wounds in the injured arm. His arm throbbed but perhaps not as much as before. It was hard to tell. Once in place, though, he thought he could keep the cycle in place with little effort.

He opened his eyes, looked around, and snorted. Time had once again run away from him. He'd wasted several hours on this whole cycle thing.

“Ready?”

He looked over at her and shrugged. Without another word, she jumped up to her feet and walked into the brush. He stared at her a moment, before convincing himself to actually get up. He groaned and rolled himself to his hand and knees before pushing himself up to his feet. And then, because there was absolutely nothing else for him to do, he pushed himself into the thorny thicket yet again.
