# 67 | Interlude [Roland]

An interlude. That was what this was, a weird part of the day where normal rules didn’t apply.

It was just enough breath of fresh air before drowning again in the depths of the waters. It was the eye of the storm, with dark clouds ominous and circling a core of calm, quiet, and peace.

He still didn’t understand it.

Rose shifted during these hours, almost to the point of becoming amicable. Here, now, it almost seemed as though she were a nice person, quietly reading a book of political intrigue that was her common fare.

So he forced himself to forget. Forget the pain of before and the pain to come. The moment now, so clear and inviting, was all there was. It was only her and him — she, kind and supportive, and he, her avid pupil, eager to learn.

Breathe while he could the air he needed to survive the day.

They discussed things, argued even, teacher and student uncovering the mysteries of the world together. They read books, of math, history, politics, and magic. In their words, Empires rose and fell on a whim, built on ideas, and destroyed by argument.

Yet even here, with such equity and congenial discussion, did they war, and in that war, he sought to undo her completely.

Politics were of particular importance to her. She repeatedly tried to teach him the current political situation, but that always ended in failure. It was too complicated, too remote, too distant. Politics as current events were too disconnected from who he was and how he’d been raised for it to make sense. A small village didn’t contain the kind of complex political situations she was trying to teach, and he had absolutely no context to learn something so obtuse, complex, and unrelated to his daily life.

The greater irony was that while he eschewed political mechanics and intrigue, he dove into the theory behind it all with abandon. He found it fascinating how things were structured and could be structured, like building a system of moving parts to make everything function well. With a single theory, he could imagine a society, one completely different from everything he knew, and extrapolate its people, its wars, its reasons, its culture, and most importantly, its failures.

In some twisted way, it felt something like how he once imagined his adventures, coining from nothing but his mind heroes, monsters, and scenarios in which he could play. Yet he was the monster now, and he hunted great beasts in the worst version of his younger self’s imagined adventures.

So he no longer imagined adventures, but societies. It was these societies, so ephemeral and complete in his mind, that he used to tease out everything Rose held dear and bludgeon them into twisted revenants.

He would rake her ideals and corrupt them. He would twist them into unnatural things that burned in the light of day. He would destroy these precious jewels of hers and make them his own.

It was a beautiful thing, to defile her most preciously held beliefs, by meticulously taking them apart with logic and reason, the very tools she’d gifted him with.

“A Treatise against Dictatorial Political Structures,” by Sancrexean Sax. Dry reading, but the tome was of particular importance to Rose. It was a book he was sure would earn anyone a lifetime of slavery if the Empire learned they possessed it. He was also reasonably certain the man’s parents hated him. What did people even call him? San Sax? Regardless, he’d already identified several aspects of the treatise he could pick at.

“Rose?” He waited as she took a moment to finish her section and looked up. “So San Sax propos—”

“San Sax?”

He raised the book and showed her the cover, to which she responded with an eyebrow and twitch of her mouth. “I’m not sure he’d appreciate the nickname. The man was ever preoccupied with pronunciation.”

He blinked at her with a cracked mouth. “He’s dead. I doubt he cares anymore.”

She let out a tired sigh. “Indeed.”

“So the basis of his treatise revolves around the idea of an entirely free marketplace.”

“Yes, mostly—”

“But he never addresses war at all. The Empire’s control of the food supply—”

“_Most_ of the food supply—”

“Doesn't matter. No province would survive without the Empire’s food.”

For a moment, he thought she might argue the point, and from this he felt a sense of glee, for it was an argument he knew he could win. Yet she nodded to concede the point, so he continued, somewhat deflated.

“Nobody dares fight a war without a war writ because the Empire would cut off their food—”

“And the draft, nobody wants to fight their own son.”

“—and this allows them to control war, to minimize it.”

“I’m not sure—“

“—but his political system is a free-for-all. It’s almost like a war made with money alone. He proposes absolute freedom to price all goods, but gives no thought to the consequences of what will come of that.”

She shook her head. “The Empire is no different. I assure you, economic war continues to be as much a reality now as under any other system.”

“Yet contained to the Royals.”

She snorted. “Is that what you think? You think regular citizens of the Empire don’t wage their own economic wars?”

“When the Empire offers food and shelter, those wars lose their edge.”

“Then perhaps what is lost is incentive.”

“Incentive to do what, kill others?”

“Incentive to do better, innovate, _create_ something new.”

“And yet leisure is ever the precursor to invention, not war.”

Her jaw clenched slightly, a clear signal he’d gotten under her skin. He’d used her own words and turned them back on her in defense of an Empire she hated with a passion that verged on zeal.

It was her only weakness.

“And is that why the Empire forbids innovation?”

He pressed his lips together at her tone, which had turned sarcastic. This was what was expected. She needed to believe he was flummoxed, or at least irritated. Yet the turn to sarcasm was a strong indication that he was on the right path.

Also, she was wrong, but only technically. The Empire didn’t categorically forbid innovation. It merely forbade gravtech research. It was a flimsy argument, though, given that gravtech formed the very basis of their society. It was not an argument he could win, yet always in such cases indirection ruled the day. If you can’t win an argument, change the context.

“You would trade the stability of the world for freedoms you personally desire.”

“Some freedoms are worth—“

“The lives of millions?”

“Don’t be dramatic, boy. All changes upset the masses. That is neither of consequence nor worth discussing. What matters is the creation of a _good_ system.”

“No, well, I mean yes, but even if that system isn’t stable? Even if it leads to a worse system?”

“Not if it has the right hands guiding it.”

“The _right_ hands? Yours, you mean?”

“Someone with enough experience, someone that _understands_ how things are, and how they should be.”

“And so now we’re back to the Empire... and the Royals.”

“They are _not_ Royals.”

“They’ve been Royals for well over a thousand years. Of course they are, no matter what their great, great, great, great grandparents had been.”

“It matters—”

“No, it doesn’t. They’ve already proven sufficient to rule.”

“By abusing the systems, killing freedom, forbidding innovation, and sending hundreds of thousands to our moon to work as slaves. All to keep the provinces dependent on their food. They set our people back thousands of years, destroyed all progress, and then destroyed all knowledge of that progress. They trapped our world—”

“Now who is repeating arguments?”

“Boy, do not test my patience. Empires aren’t categorically bad, but they must be replaced when they trample on the freedom of the people.”

“The freedom to make war?”

“People don’t need freedom to make war.”

“The problem—”

“The problem is you.”

“Me? I don’t see how—”

“You’re afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“The evils of the Empire are obvious, but you refuse to see them because you’re afraid of hypotheticals. You’re afraid of what might be while the evil in front of you flourishes. You think because you read a book on power, you understand how it all works. But you don’t. You’ve never led anything. You’ve never even seen the slaves, nor have you any understanding of the cost of your precious stability.”

“And without stability there is anarchy, and that will kill people quicker—”

“You’d chain up half the population of the world to serve the other half, only for the sake of stability?”

“No, that’s not—”

“And yet, that’s what you defend.”

“Half the population seems—”

“It doesn’t matter the size. Slavery is a cancer,” she said in a calm but tired voice, “It need only start with one, but it will spread. Just like your precious tenants of power, slavery is a form of power that will naturally consolidate. More and more excuses will be made until the elite _own_ the rest of the world.”

“Which is why there must be something to balance, some check on that power.”

“So now you want to put a check on the consolidation of power?”

“Of course!”

“Then do it on something that isn’t cancer.”

He shook his head vigorously, aware that the conversation had spiraled outside his control. Yet unable to simply walk away, he was forced to see it through. “You’d kill the patient to cure the disease. What you suggest is nothing less than to destroy people’s very lives. You’d throw out a stable system that everyone already relies on because you don’t like the way it works.”

“Of course they rely on it, there’s nothing else. If relying on a system is your excuse for no change, no change will ever come. The people will rely on what’s there, always, because they have to.”

“So you change it from within, not start a civil war that will kill half the population.” In truth, he had no idea if this was her goal, yet it seemed to fit what he’d pieced together of her intentions, even if he had no idea how he fit into it. He did, though, fit in come way he couldn’t understand, he was sure of it.

“You cannot negotiate with cancer without it consuming your—”

“And you cannot rely on platitudes for your pretext to destroy an Empire, a entire people.” It was the wrong thing to say. Her eyes turned dangerous and he scrambled back in his mind to find a another path less likely to end in pain. Sometimes, when cornered, you teleport the conversation and hope the other person didn’t notice. “The free market Sanchrea— uh, San Sax, proposes would inevitably kill freedoms quicker than that the Empire.

“Is that what you believe?”

No. He didn’t believe anything except was necessary to destroy her.

“You equivocate the issue,” she continued, “The Empire killed freedom. They sold security to the people for the ever so small price of slavery.”

“The free markets are a quicker death of freedom.”

“Oh? And please enlighten me on how a _free_ market curtails freedom.”

“It’s the tenants of power—”

“That again.”

“Yes, _that_. You made me read the book.”

“It was supposed to round out your knowledge, but instead, you somehow managed to turn it into a sacred text.”

“Because it makes the most sense. Power consolidates itself. It always does. A homogenous distribution of power is an unsustainable system, a precursor at best, to something else.”

“You’re not wrong, power does consolidate. And from it rose the Empire—”

“Which has already consolidated. It’s a stable system, the best platform for change. A free market is an unstable system by the very nature of power to consolidate itself. The results would be unpredictable until the system solidified into a power structure, one unlikely to benefit to society, given the contentious nature of the originating system. It would practically encourage those with the most aggressive natures and least morality to dominate the system.”

“Unless the political structure intervenes.”

“Exactly, which is what the Emprire does.”

“Strangling the economy is hardly the proper kind of intervention.”

“Yet it results in a stable society,” dammit but he’d not intended to concede her point, “A completely free market invites instability.”

Her eyes tightened. “Yes, we’ve discussed stability before. The current system is certainly stable, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best system, or even a good system, especially when it utilizes slavery on a mass scale to maintain a stranglehold over the food supply to preserve an ironclad control over the populace.”

This was a better direction, one he could work with. Slavery was an old argument between them and usually meant he was on the right track. She was vehemently against it and hated it when he argued for it.

“And you would propose locking criminals in small cells to make them an even greater burden on society than they already are?”

“Incarceration is a disincentive to criminal behavior without providing an incentive to abuse and—”

“—and you would just foist that burden on society.”

Her eyes flashed in annoyance. “The alternative is abuse, Roland.”

“All systems can be abused, that’s—”

“—not the point. Your argument applies to everything, and thus results in no point at all. All systems can be abused, so let’s move on. The Empire is a system wholly abused, and anything that might replace _could_ be abused. The point you can’t seem to grasp is that some systems will inherently be better than others by their very nature. Sancrexean may not have all the salient issues resolved, but he _did_ have a grasp on the nature of a good system, namely, that free markets can be held accountable by political structures so long as the incentives align properly.”

She’d turned everything back to the original point, which was not the point of having the argument, at least to him. He couldn’t argue it, mostly because he agreed with that part of the treatise. San Sax had actually put forth an elegant system of checks that could work. But that didn’t matter when it provided nothing he could use to destroy her beliefs. So instead, he chose to focus on the one part she couldn’t argue against.

“So instead you destroy everything? Raze it all to the ground—”

“No, you create a weapon that will destroy the cancer.”

“A weapon? What are you—”

“I think that’s enough for today. It’s time for your training.”

It was too soon, he'd pushed too far. They should still be talking, arguing for at least another hour. Instead, the argument spiraled out of control until he cornered himself. It wasn’t enough time, not enough to recover. He stood even as him mind replayed the argument over and over, trying to find the place he went wrong, the decision, the words that had led him into this trap.

He pushed down the tears with practiced efficiency, his face smoothed into nothing. Today would be a day for cracking. A day for the walls he’d built to be tested. He told himself that was ok. Cracks in the wall of his self could be reformed, strengthened. And tomorrow they would do it again, all over again. He’d have another chance, another opportunity to pry into her walls, pry them open and destroy her. Another chance. There was always another chance. If only he could pry her open and destroy her. He lived for that chance. Someday, he’d destroy her.

He walked out into a pouring rain. The rain was always cold this high in the mountains, yet it would have no bearing on their training. He was okay with that. The rain would obscure, and maybe, just maybe she wouldn’t see the cracks form in his self.
