# 62 | Prison [Roland]

Roland woke with a gasp, then gulped in air with a desperate need. It felt like he hadn’t breathed in ages.

“You have tormented dreams, treewalker.” She spoke in a lilting voice that carried concern and curiosity in equal measure.

His thoughts felt slow and muddy, and the earth seemed to sway beneath him. Flashes of water and thrashing sounded distant in his head, then faded. Whatever dream he’d had, he wasn’t sure he wanted to remember it.

He lay on stone, then opened his eyes to see a smooth stone ceiling. He shifted his eyes around, but all was stone in hard angles. A stone prison? No, that sounded stupid, and it was a surprisingly attractive idea, which meant it couldn’t be true. Prisons meant slavery, slavery meant people, and he missed people.

But a person had spoken. He sat up and groan as a knife pressed into his temple. His visioned narrowed to a point and drove his head back to the ground.

“Careful now, you’ve lost a lot of blood.”

Memories flooded in of a child goddess that twisted reality, blood pooled around his feet, the entrails of a monster spilled out with pitiful cries, delight and guilt, a stumbled run from something big, something unknown.

A dragon hunted him.

Panic drove him back up, and pain shoved him back down. A demon pranced and danced and shredded his skull with its claws. He grasped at his head but hit it instead with something hard.

“Okay wow, that is almost exactly the opposite of careful. I don’t think you have enough blood to sit up.”

After only a few moments, the demon had abandoned him with only a mild memory of pain. He breathed out a sight of relief and tried to put all the memories in order. Slowly, the details filled in, and he recalled why exactly he’d lost so much blood.

Also, he couldn’t feel his arm. He pushed down the panic and raised his arm, half-expecting to see it missing, yet was presented with leaves.

He had an arm made of leaves now? No, wow, his thoughts were still muddy. It was a wrap made of tightly woven blue-green leaves and some kind of mud that had hardened into a paste.

That could not be sanitary. “What did you do to my arm?”

“A thank-you would be more appropriate.”

“I can’t feel my arm.” He waved it around, which felt weird. He could feel the weight of it but nothing else.

“I would think not.”

“Oh, right, okay.” He pulled at it, but the paste had hardened into a cast.

“Oh stop fretting. The paste is a natural anesthetic. Otherwise, you’d be in quite a bit of pain. It’ll also keep infection out... err, mostly out. Ah, it’ll keep most infections out. Hopefully, nothing settled in before I put it on.”

“Oh, okay then, that’s good," he replied in a tone that suggested the opposite.

He cast a skeptical look up at his arm as he held it above him. He was worried she’d slapped on some clay or dirt, but he had to admit it didn’t look like any dirt he’d ever seen. He absently picked at the paste while he took a good look around him.

It was a stone room, perhaps the same same size as his room at home, though a bit longer and narrower. Recessed into the ceiling were evenly spaced gravlights that cast a ghostly blue glow. The color felt off, not quite the same blue he'd come to expect and it made the room feel mildly alien. He lay on a thin blanket cast over a stone bed that appeared to be carved from the long side of the wall, though he didn't waste the effort to verify that. Across from it was a small table attached to, or carved from the wall, with two stone benches on either side, both also protruding from the wall. The room appeared to have been carved out of stone.

His flower-picking girl goddess lived in a stone room carved into the mountain. He was tempted to think that strange, but then everything about the girl was strange, so why not have her live in the mountain? Perhaps she would grow sharp teeth and eat him for dinner as well.

He shuddered at the childhood story and briefly wondered why they always seemed to involve cannibalism. Of course, he didn't actually know they were in the mountain, but the chill in the air suggested it.

And not the whole room was stone. He didn't dare try twist his head back to see behind him, so that was an unknown. But over his feet, he saw what might have been a door at the end of the room, if doors had no handle or lock, and were made out of gravwood, which was patently absurd given the sheer expense involved. He blinked and looked again. It really looked like gravwood, and it was recessed into the stone with no hinge or way to open it. Maybe it was some other wood stained to look like—

"Stop Picking!"

He'd gotten his finger under a rather large chunk of whatever the blue-green gunk was. It had turned his finger numb.

"Sorry," he mumbled as he tried to flick it away.

It took him a couple attempts to send the goup flying across the room, which earned him a glare from the girl that would have made his mother proud.

How old was she anyway? Fifteen, or eighteen, or even older? She looked so young and even acted like it sometimes. Yet other times he would have sworn she were much older, and that ignoring the whole goddess mode she seemed to adopt at times.

He tried to sit up again, but that resulted in a swarm of red spots that danced merrily in his eyes. He groaned and fell back. The pain wasn’t as bad as the first time, so there was that at least.

The girl shook her head and looked at him with a tired amusement. “You’re just not really into the whole careful thing, are you? You lost a lot of blood... and I mean a lot. I’m mildly surprised you lived.”

“Thank you?”

She laughed. “Oh, you’re welcome. Honestly, I’m not actually sure how you survived.”

He glanced at the wrap again. “How long?”

“Hmmm... oh, a week? Or maybe a day or— you know, it feels like you've been here forever, so let’s just forget about how long really.”

Roland felt a new wave of panic. He needed to get back to Rose. He was late and she would... what? In truth, he had no idea what she would do with him out for so long. Would she worry? He tried to imagine Rose pacing back and forth in worry, but it was a ridiculous image. More likely, she was choosing a weapon to beat him with. That was an easy image to conjure.

“You okay? You look like you’re going to an execution.”

“A what?”

“An execution? You know, where they kill people for doing bad things?”

“Ah, no.”

He couldn’t recall that ever happening and, in fact, was sure it was illegal. Most offenses ended in slavery, not execution. Why execute someone who could still benefit society? The only killing he’d heard of was someone stupid enough to attack a Royal, but that was less of an execution than it was a suicide-by-Royal.

The girl was so odd. She was clearly young but acted old, her clothes were nothing he’d ever seen before, she said things that made no sense, and she was possibly borderline insane, which might explain everything.

Of course, he might be too. Also, he didn’t even know her name, and that suddenly seemed like a glaring oversight.

“So, what’s your name?” That felt awkward.

She turned from whatever she was doing and looked at him strangely. “Elliendiere Ashratak.”

“El... Ellien... what?” She’d turned her R’s into a weird half-consonants he hadn’t followed, although his head still swam so maybe that was it.

Her face flashed confusion but that was quickly swallowed, then softened. “Ellie. You can call me Ellie. What’s yours?”

“Roland... uh, Anselm.” He swayed a little as the world shifted under him. He was still lying down, right?

“Hi, Roland uh Anselm, nice to meet you.”

“No, no... just Roland Anselm.”

“Hi, just Roland Anselm, nice to meet you.”

He sighed and almost corrected her again, but her lips were twisted in amusement and her eyes danced. Dammit, she was messing with him. Also, she was tilting to the side.

Oh no, that was him.

“Roland?”

“Yeah?”

“Goodnight.”

He tried to protest but managed only to slur something unintelligible. She reached over and gently pushed his head back down the ground. He had a hundred questions, but they fled his mind under an exhaustion that pummelled his consciousness into oblivion.

---

Bright floral scents lured him from darkness’s warm embrace. His stomach growled, yet for a time, he stood on a precipice, unable to commit. Sleep felt good, better than he could remember, but his hunger was unrelenting. It pressed at him until he realized it would never surrender the battle.

He sat up and, aside from slight dizziness, felt no further discomfort and looked around with bleary eyes.

He was in the same stone room as before, which he suddenly realized might actually be a prison. It would explain a lot and — woah, the whole back wall was missing. It opened into a black his eyes couldn't penetrate, but he thought maybe the ground shifted at some point to open the room to a cave.

He glanced back to the door with no handle. Maybe it really was a prison. That would explain the door, but then what kind of prison used gravwood doors?

He shook off the thought and spotted Ellie sitting on the bench leaned over a pot on some kind of hot plate he'd never seen before. It looked delicate and expensive. The pot bubbled and steamed.

She looked oddly content as she stirred the post with a movement that almost looked graceful. She was cooking something, of course, but he couldn't make out what. Next to her were two wooden cups, both of which had something steaming in them.

He realized she was humming, and had been for quite some time. His breath caught and tears threatened.

He knew that tune. It was one his mother used to sing to him when he was scared. Ellie’s version was different, more complex. Where he’d expect a single long note, she produced a complex melody that made his mother’s version sound simple and mundane, as though years had worn down the song. As beautiful as the song was, it reminded him of his mother, and that threatened to undo him in a way he wasn’t prepared for.

He got up suddenly and wavered a little, but didn't fall. He sarcastically marked that as a victory. Staying upright seemed to be a challenge for him of late.

She turned at the motion and looked over with concern. Seeing him up, she smiled, waved him over, and turned back to her pot.

He walked over to the door.

The door made an angry protest as he approached. He jumped back startled then paused as he felt the mountain rumble, although most of the sensation was less physical than gravic. It felt like a Whitewood moving or shifting, which was impossible but the only way he could think of it.

"Huh... that's never happened," Ellie said. She'd stopped stirring to stare at him with a curious expression.

He glanced at her, then back at the door and, because he was stupid, he walked back up to it.

Nothing happened.

He placed his hand on the door and was somehow unsurprised to find it gravwood. What did surprise him was that it was gravtech. So not just a door, but a device, though why one would use gravtech for a door was beyond him, much less how to use it.

On closer inspection, he found the door continued into the wall on all sides, which was confusing as it would prevent the door from opening at all... unless perhaps it slid into the wall? He began to feel around for a panel or spot he could use to feed it energy but the whole thing was a smooth piece and he eventually concluded it must operate from the other side. He grew more convinced that this was a prison cell.

"When you're done fondling the door..." Ellie gestured to two bowls she'd set out. He became suddenly and painfully aware just how hungry he was.

He walked back and sat down opposite her, looked down at a bowl of stew of some sort, and said, "What is it?"

She gave him a flat look. "Do you even know what gratitude is?"

His eyes flicked back to the bowl with no small amount of suspicion. It looked like dirty water littered with roots.

She rolled her eyes. "Ugh, it's just some roots with herbs and such. Nothing special, but it'll help you recover.”

So it really was dirty water littered with roots. While he would have preferred something a little more substantial, perhaps with some meat in it, at least it smelled good, if a little bland after Rose's cooking. That was a point for Ellie, though.

He watched her for a second or two before sipping the tea, which seemed the safer option at the moment. He looked down at it in surprise. It was really good tea. It had a minty sweetness that drew his lips back to the cup of their own accord.

Ellie had already eaten a couple bites of the 'stew', so at least it wouldn't kill him, and after the tea, his stomach insisted he consume something more substantial. He took a tentative sip and— wow, that was really good.

He immediately stuffed the rest of it down as quickly as he could. It burned, but that was no obstacle to a hungry stomach. He slurped and gulped the soup for a couple minutes before he realized he hadn’t registered movement from Ellie for quite some time. He looked over to see her staring at him with her mouth slightly ajar and with something like a shock-and-awe expression painted on her face. It occurred to him that he might have actually groaned a little.

“Sorry, I—”

“No, no, please continue. It’s not often I get to observe the feeding habits of the local wildlife so closely. I wasn’t even aware food could be consumed so quickly.”

“Ahhh...” He looked down at his now-empty bowl. His stomach growled again, and this time he was sure it echoed throughout the room.

“Oh, please continue.”

She gestured eagerly to the soup, dipped her spoon into her bowl, and then raised it to her mouth. She sipped lightly without taking her eyes off him.

As conspicuous as he felt, his hunger was a demanding beast, and he refilled his bowl. He ate quickly but tried to keep the groaning, slurping, and gulping to a minimum with only moderate success. He didn’t actually start slowing down enough to talk until the third bowl.

"So how does the door open?"

She screwed up her face in a 'how should I know' look.

"Well, you live here don't you?"

She shrugged. "I only found the place. I didn't build it."

His mouth dropped open. "And you never tried to open the door?" A door that couldn't open would practically beg him to try, constantly, and forever. He was already trying to figure out how he might _pull_ the thing out of the wall.

"A few times, but I think it only opens from the other side. Please don't destroy my home."

Well, there went that idea. "What’s on the other side?"

She shrugged lightly as she brought her spoon to her mouth. He gave her an exasperated look but earned only a twitch of a smile in response.

"Is it a prison?"

"Hmm... maybe," she shrugged again, which was starting to irritate him. "So, how exactly do you slide around like that?"

He screwed up his mouth at the shift in conversation. He wanted to ask more questions but fair was fair. He could answer a couple of hers, though he took a moment to refill his bowl first.

“Well, I guess I just pull the tree to me. Or maybe me to it? ...actually, it depends. Smaller trees get pulled to me, but I get pulled toward larger trees... or... err, maybe we’re just pulled together and whoever is smaller moves?” He was wrecking his explanation. Maybe he just needed more food. He took another bite.

“Oh, so it that what you do when you take those big jumps?”

“Uh huhmmmrrr es”. It was all he could manage through the food in his mouth.

“Or, is that what you did when you slid under the lizard?”

He swallowed quickly. “It was a grek, and yes.”

One didn’t go out and slay a lizard. One hunted and slew great beasts. Calling it a lizard just ruined the point.

“How weird. When I saw you sliding, I actually tilted my head because for you it was as though the ground had tilted, even though everything else stayed the same.”

“Maybe I was falling a little, but I was falling toward the tree.”

“The Whitewood? So you use gravics to do it?”

“Of course, what else would I use?”

“Nothing, I just never heard of anyone doing what you do.”

He gave her a light shrug with a small but wry smile. She pursed her lips with a wrinkled her nose and took another bite of stew, of which only half had been eaten.

"We're in the mountains?" he asked after he judged an appropriate amount of time had passed to shift the conversation back to more important matters.

"Hmmm."

"Which one?" It bothered him because none of the mountains were close to where they'd been.

She shot him a disbelieving look, opened her mouth, shut it, thought a moment, then opened it again. "Oh, it's the second mountain to the right of that other one. You know, the one where you have to turn right by the tree to get to?"

"Huh?"

She huffed out an exasperated breath. "There's thousands of mountains, Roland. I didn't name them. How could I even tell you which one?"

He opened his mouth before he could come up with a sarcastic retort and realized there was none. She was absolutely right. He hadn't named them either.

"But we're actually _in_ the mountain?"

"You really enjoy asking obvious questions, don't you?"

"But... but you didn't make this?" He gestured to the room.

"Oh, I'm sorry, you're suddenly right. I forgot. I dug this place out with a wooden spoon centuries ago and created a door no one could enter for the hell of it... really? What are you even asking?"

"Then who did?"

"How should I know? The mountains are riddled with ruins."

"Riddled with ruins..." he breathed the words in awe.

Some part of him he'd long ago buried clawed its way out of his chest and practically dragged him up. Ruins. Just the idea of exploring ruins sent tendrils of boyish excitement though him.

"Wow, maybe you should lie down. I think you lost more blood than we thought." Ellie stood and walked over to Roland, who also had stood at some point during the conversation. She reached to grab his arm just as he turned to walk back to the door.

"The door's not doing anywhere, Roland. I think you need more sleep."

He snorted. Sleep was not what he needed, and besides, who knew how long he'd been gone. Despite his desire to find out what was behind the door, he felt antsy to get back and finish his hunt. He gave the door one last look and turned away.

"I need to get back."

"Oh." She withdrew her hand and turned away back to the pot, picked up the empty bowls, stacked them, and then placed the spoons in the top one. She stacked the tea cups as well with a wooden motion.

He felt a stab of guilt as he gathered his things, which had been placed under the bed-slab thing. It occurred to him then that she might be just a lonely as he was out here. He was half-tempted to offer her to come home with him, but he could think of no way that would work. Just the though made him angry. Rose would take her from him, just like she'd taken everything.

He turned back to her. "I'll try to—"

"The Wyrm will still be looking for you," she said in a clipped tone.

Right. He wondered if it actually existed. Maybe not. Maybe she was just as lonely as he was, and the dragon little more than an excuse to keep him here. It was a pleasant thought, but it didn't matter. He had to get back and nothing would change that.

A few tense moments of silence followed as she watched him gear up with a blank expression. When he was done she gesture to the edge of the missing wall. He walked over and stepped out into the darkness.

She yanked him back hard. "Really? Do always just walk first and think later?"

"Wha— oh."

His eyes widened as he realized that while the light did spill out into the dark, it did not spill out on any floor. He'd almost walked over a cliff.

"You are something else..." she said, then walked over the cliff.

He made an odd, strangled sound as he instinctually grasped for her, but she was gone. He gritted his teeth while he pushed back the panic. He did not just loose his first and only friend in what felt like ages. She just did something he couldn't understand. She had to. That was the only explanation. She might be an insane goddess girl but there was nothing about her that even hinted she was suicidal. Gods he hoped she wasn't, because he wasn't sure he could bear loosing—

"Are you just going to stand there with dumb look on your face or are you coming?" Her voice sounded distant, far below, and had lilted almost into that taunting song she seemed to like so much.

"Yes... no, I mean no. Ah... just give me a minute."

He wasted a minute pushing down the lump that had formed in his throat then pushed his head out into the darkness. The room's light hadn't seemed so bright until he tried to adjust to the darkness of what he suspected was a massive cave. It took several minutes before he caught distant glints of a wet blue that may have been a wall.

And that was it. He couldn't see anything else.

"I thought you needed to get home?"

"Yeah, but I can't see."

"Why would you need to see?" She sounded genuinely confused. "Just do your pulley thing and get down here."

Aside from the desire to correct her — he did not do 'pulley' things — she was right, he could feel the Whitewoods above him, distant, but there. He _pulled_ on one above and in front of him, walked out into the darkness, and swung himself into a stone wall.

"Ah... that was a column — wow, you really can't see can you?"

He mumbled something incomprehensible as he drifted back and forth and waited for the lights dancing in his eyes to clear. His impact had imparted an angular momentum that lazily spun him in circles and brought the bright room in and out of his view.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine." But his head was starting to hurt and, more alarming, so was his arm.

"Well, okay. You're a weird one, but how about you follow my voice? There's nothing... ah, yeah no, nothing between you and me."

He did not trust that at all, and it occurred to him just how much he was at her mercy. He cast another anchor above and in her direction and readied to lower himself toward her very slowly. In the process, he twisted around toward the room again and realized that one of the spots hadn't cleared from his eyes, above and to the right of Ellie's room.

He abandoned his other anchor and chose one beyond the light, almost too distant to _pull_ on properly. With some effort, he brought himself to the light and peered in.

It was another room, just like hers, though a bit longer, as though hers had been sheared in half. It had the same stone bed, table, and benches, but aside from that nothing else except a very thick layer of dust.

It really must be a prison, and one with lights that lasted forever. He'd just assumed that Ellie had found a way to feed the room's lights, not that they last forever. That just wasn't something he'd heard of before, or even though possible. The mystery of it burned his curiosity.

"For someone who wants to go home, you certainly don't act like it."

He grimaced. He never said he wanted to go home, just that he had to. "I think it really is a prison."

"Yeah." She sounded bored.

He stared for a moment at a replica of the door in her room with regret. The idea of abandoning so much mystery just to go back home to Rose was sacrilege, but he had no way to get beyond those doors and the anxiety of being away was starting to eat at him, as was his arm, which was becoming harder to ignore.

He cast a third anchor and pulled, noting how much easier it was to do it from underneath the trees rather than between them. He maneuvered himself, slowly of course, toward the general direction he last heard her until he realized that it would help if she actually talked.

"So how did you find this place?"

He heard a light rustle.

"Did you just shrug?"

"Hmmm... maybe?"

She was a lot closer than he expected, or he was sure he'd have found a better retort than silence, but at the same time his mind cast around for something suitably sarcastic, his feet had found the ground.

"Well, that certainly took long enough. You are a very distractible person, you know."

He ignored the comment and started walking, very much aware that he had no idea how to leave nor even if his next step would send him off another cliff. The whole situation made him feel vulnerable.

A soft hand wrapped around his and pulled him off course. "It'll be easier if you let me guide you."

Easier to get out, maybe, but not easier to accept. While he was accustomed to feeling powerless before Rose, that was a contentious relationship designed to scour from him every vulnerability, every weakness. This felt different and uncomfortable on a level that made him nervous in an frustratingly vague way.

Within a few moments, the ground began to rise and forced them both to scramble and pick their way up. A few times, they had to climb. That was made easier when he could simply _pull_ himself up, though he had to be careful with no light to see by. At times, the roof seemed perilously close while other times it felt as though the darkness extended forever. The mind seemed to struggle to make sense of reality without any light to see by.

The further they went the less trees he had to _pull_ on until he became certain they were walking underneath some kind of field. He had to reach very far ahead and a good ways behind to maintain a reasonable _pull_, and even then was forced to resort to actual climbing.

The darkness became a companion, suffocating at times, restful at others, but always feeling as though it consumed time in large chunks, then spit them back out randomly. A few times they had to backtrack so she could choose another way up. After the third time, with his arm throbbing enough that he wished she had removed it, his frustration bubbled over.

“Shouldn’t you know how to get in and out of here?”

“Of course,” she said.

“Then why are we backtracking?”

“Well, I don’t take this way, obviously.”

“Wait, there’s an _easier_ way out?” A certain amount of frustration might have crept into his voice and raised it an octave or two.

She paused as though in thought. “No.”

She pulled on arm but rebounded as he refused to move. His arm hurt, his head ached, he’d reopened other wounds, gained a whole host of additional scratches, was tired of the dark, and felt very, very petulant.

She huffed and gestured in a generally upward direction. “We’re almost there, unless you like the dark?”

He blinked at the realization that he could see her. The light was barely there, but it was enough to actually make out the floor, which was littered with loose rock.

He let go of her hand and _pulled_ himself over the mound of rock they’d been fighting, which had hidden behind it a small crack through which light was shining. He almost made it to that crack, his finger just brushing the edge, but the trees were too far and the angle too shallow to get him there.

A hand reached down through the crack and grasped his as he made a fourth attempt to catch the edge. It pulled him up far enough that he could latch his elbow over while the rest of his body dangled in the darkness. His other arm was practically useless and he was forced to swing his lower body until he could latch his leg up on the ledge. He got just enough of his mass above the lip that he could _pull_ and use the shallow angle to scrape him over the lip. He rolled over on to his back and let his eyes adjust to the sunshine, or let the throbbing in his arm subside, or the same for his head, and really he was breathing far too hard.

“See? We’re out,” Ellie said.

He rolled his head over to look at her, frowned, rolled his head back toward the crack in the ground, then rolled it back to her.

“How did you— ugh… gods, what is that smell?”

“Oh, of course! What hunter can go home without a trophy?”

Her smile was far too eager, which made him suspicious, but he allowed his eyes to follow her gesture to a large, rough-spun bag with a drawstring neatly tied in a bow. It sat under a bush.

His frown deepened as he looked around and realized they were surrounded by thick bushes. Sitting up didn’t provide any perspective, and standing barely brought his eyes above them. But what he could see was nothing but bushes and just maybe a tree line far beyond that.

He was in hell. There was no way to _pull_ himself over the brush. He would have to push his way through and he felt tired just thinking about it.

Instead, he walked over to the bag and winced at the smell. A small swarm of flies expanded as he approached, but it didn’t appear they’d made it inside. He quickly opened it, confirmed that it was the grek’s head, closed it immediately, and tied it tight. It was recognizable at least.

He picked up the bag and tied it around his belt but shook his head in annoyance. The head was large and awkward, and would make it impossible to move quickly, so he immediately untied it. After some thought, he unstrapped his sword, tied the bag about mid-way down his back, and then re-attached the sword and tucked it under the head. It was still awkward, but it shouldn’t pull him off balance. Ellie watched the whole thing with an amused expression on her face.

He looked around, spotted the mountain range, and felt his heart lurch. He didn’t recognize the range at first which made no sense, until he spotted a familiar peak further down. She had carried him how far?

“Hey treewalker,” Ellie sang with a smirk on her face. She flashed him an innocent smile. “This way!”

She strolled into the brush, which warped away to give her a path.

He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and slowly let it out. He had a hundred questions and no desire to ask them. It was going to be a long day.
