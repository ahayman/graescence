# 49 | The Trap [Sal]

Djrek stood at the top of steep, wide stairs that had been cut from the cliff that formed the last plate plate above the sea. Ash stood nearby, also looking out for something, or pretending to. Sal was pretty sure she didn't work half as much as she showed.

Sal walked up to Djrek, opposite side of Ash, and stared stared down the steps. Below, three docks fanned out from a larger staging-dock, all floating on the water and attached to a channel cut through the center of the stairs. A faded water line marked the high tide fifty paces above the current docks. As the tides rose, the channel would pull the docks in, keeping them in line with the stairs.

He watched as drajin were off loaded from a large transport on to one of the docks. A dozen men kept them corralled until they could be attached to a sled. From there, they were guided to a line that led from the docks, up the stairs, and on to one of the warehouse behind him.

Djrek pulled his eyes from the sea after twenty-one seconds and turned to Sal. His brow shot up as he took in Sal's appearance, but he only let out an amused grunt and returned to his search.

"Huh," Ash said, leaning back to also take in Sal's appearance, "that explains a lot."

Djrek nodded, eyes still distant, "It's not often we loose track of our charge."

"Kinda ruins the whole point of being bait though," Ash said.

Sal scowled at her. "Just because I'm bait doesn't mean I have to make it easy."

Djrek grunted again. "Boy's got a point. Perhaps we have been making it too easy. Could have scared them off."

"Perhaps," Ash said with doubt in her voice, "but I'd wager on the capital, where there'll be far more... resources available."

That caught Sal's attention, and he leaned forward, peering around Djrek to give an inquisitive look at Ash. "I thought once we got to the capital..." he'd be... not safe, but safer.

Ash turned and leaned back against the plate's railing. She had that knowing smirk in her eyes. "Naw, the most dangerous part of our trip will be making it through the cities. That's two whole days for them to try just about anything."

"Two _days_?"

She grew a lopsided smile. "Oh, you'll see."

"There," Djrek said suddenly and pointed out at the sea.

Sal stared at Ash for another three seconds, then turned and cast his gaze out at the sea. There were dozens of ships of varying sizes approaching or leaving the many docks, but Djrek had pointed far beyond them. He continued to stare until he saw what Djrek had pointed out: a small spec visible just below the horizon.

Djrek turned and set a quick pace southward. As usual, he made a straight line as people, crates, and even drajin were moved out of his way. Sal wasn't certain the man even noticed it.

Djrek stopped at a dock twenty-six, five down from where they'd been. No other ships were at this dock, and so the chaos of sleds and men were missing here. The dock was different than the others, singular and double decked, with what appeared to be an upper and lower gangway.

The black spec had made impressive time, giving Sal a good view of the ship. What he saw surprised him. The ship had no masts or sails, not even row holes; as far as Sal could tell, it had no means of propulsion at all. The bow was long, thin, and fully enclosed, sweeping from a point far in the front to almost a third way back, where it flared out slightly. It was not a ship that went over the waves, but through them.

Curious, he scanned the bay and saw a couple other ships with a similar design, if not nearly as sleek as the black vessel. Most ships had masts, though, and all ships had elongated bows designed to slice through tall waves.

"How does it move?" Sal asked, but Djrek was already walking toward a thin man with eye glasses looking at a clipboard.

The man looked up with a bored expression as Djrek approached. His eyes widened in recognition, and his back straightened. "Inquisitor?"

"May I assume you have replacements ready?" Djrek said.

The man nodded, "Of course."

"Good, I would like to be off within an hour of docking."

"Yes, yes, of course. I'll have the barracks master begin preparations."

"Good, and thank you."

"Of course. It is my pleasure to serve."

Djrek nodded, and turned in dismissal as his eyes trained on the approaching ship. Sal saw the man let out a relieved breath before hurrying over to a nearby warehouse. Ash had walked over to the stairs and sat down, pack at her side, as she too watched the ship.

It took another sixteen minutes and forty-three seconds for the ship to arrive, then only four minutes for it to dock; in all, it had only been thirty-two minutes since they'd seen the ship as little more than a spec on the horizon. It was, Sal concluded, a very fast ship.

Once docked, a door opened onto the lower gangway and... people began filing out, though calling them people stretched the term. They had pale skin that would make the people of Sal's hometown appear downright dark. They were gaunt bordering on skeletal, with hollow eyes and a defeated, exhausted look. Wooden collars, a deep rudy brown, wrapped their necks and were coupled with cuffs on their wrists. Almost as soon as they the last one existed the gangway, another group began to file on. These were also thin and gaunt, but at least they looked refreshed.

Suddenly, Sal realized where the ship got its power. "Slaves."

"Pushers," Djrek said from beside him.

Sal glanced over at him. "I thought all slaves were sent to Ionia?"

"Most are, but those with strong constitutions are retained by the Empire."

Strong constitutions? "You mean, those who have a lot of gravic potential."

Djrek dipped his head. "All pushers have large reserves of energy by definition. The Empire keeps all of those over a certain threshold, excepting godlings of course, who are put down. However, you'll find many pushers, especially for a ship such as this, are very close to that definition."

"Isn't that dangerous?"

"Why would it— oh, you mean your godling." Sal frowned as Djrek took a deep breath. He didn't like it being referred to as his godling, as though he were somehow responsible for it.

"The godling that destroyed your village makes a mockery of the term. It is, to put it bluntly, insanely powerful. Most godlings you'll encounter will be capable of destroying anything from a small house to a large building at best— dangerous, yes, but manageable. Yours could sneeze and wipe out a large city."

A concern Sal had carried for a long time bubbled to the surface. "Is that why didn't you hunt it?"

Djrek turned to him, his face serious. "I don't admit this often but a godling with that much power is beyond me. It's beyond any single Inquisitor and it'll take considerable resources to put down." He winced. "That aside, I'm pretty sure someone stole it."

"_Stole_ it?" Sal gaped at him. "How do you steel a godling?"

Djrek folded his arms and turned back to watch the slaves. "When godlings first express their power, it's usually because of a trigger, and that trigger is almost always some sort of trauma that encourages them to empty every last bit of power they contain. Such drastic expenditures of energy inevitably render them unconscious for anywhere from an hour to a day. For your godling, I'd say days, perhaps even a week. At the very least, those military scouts should have found it. If not them, we certainly would have— I sent out dozens of scouts to find it. But we didn't; we found nothing at all. That could only happen if someone took him.

"It's what makes Youlson's conspiracy so worrisome. An illegal Elderin operation threatens to destabilize the Empire, but it's a tame thing all things considered. This isn't the first time a Royal has tried using it, and it certainly won't be the last— Elderin's a strong lure to those seeking power..."

"But you think it's something more."

He wagged his head to the side. "It _could_ just be an expansive Elderin operation. The godling _could_ have woken up, walked a dozen paces, fallen into a hole, and died. _Perhaps_ the very weird... education of your village was simply a way to keep you isolated and happy. _Perhaps_ your unusual strength in gravics is just that, unusual. And just _maybe_ it's a fluke that you happened to grow up in the same village as a godling the likes of which haven't been seen in thousands of years... perhaps not ever."

He sighed. "It could just all be a coincidence. I hope it is."

Sal looked at the slaves as they filed in. "But if they're not—"

"Then someone is in possession of a weapon that can destroy whole cities, and that should be our biggest concern right now. But it's not, because someone might actually be trying to make godlings and just the possibility they might succeed, no matter how remote, takes full precedence."

Djrek walked toward Ash and lightly touched her shoulder. She got up and they both began walking down the stairs. The last of the slaves had entered the lower hold, leaving the docks clear.

They climbed to the upper gangway and boarded the deck. Where Sal's imagination expected sails, masts, ropes, and burly sailors, was instead a clean looking, almost empty deck with a single woman to greet them. She was tall, chestnut skin, hair to match and pulled back into a tight bun. She was wearing a full black suit with wide lapels, perfectly tailored to show curves without being suggestive.

"Welcome board the Ataran. If you would follow me, I'll see you to your rooms to settle."

Without waiting — or, oddly, even giving her name — she turned and headed toward the fore, to a door led sheltered under the flared bow guard. All was a matte black, not paint, or not a paint Sal had ever seen. Perhaps a stain of some sort, yet it didn't look quite real for some reason. It took Sal a few seconds to realize why; it was too perfect. There were no chips in the veneer, nor gouges or even a single scratch that he could see.

They entered into a small hallway and walked a small ways before she stopped in front of a older man sharply dressed in black, similar to the woman, though his white hair added an air of experience and distinction. The lady turned to them.

"If is allowable," she said to Djrek, "our captain can give the young masters a tour of the bridge?"

"That's an excellent idea." Djrek turned to Sal and motioned at his pack. Sal handed it to Djrek, who handed it to the woman.

She turned to Sal. "This gentleman here is the captain. While you are on this ship, his word is law. Touch nothing, understand?"

Sal nodded. She waved her hand toward the man and walked down the hall. Djrek and Ash followed, leaving Sal with a strange, white haired man that contrasted sharply with his dark brown skin.

"Well, glad all that is over with," the man said in a gravely voice, then stuck out his hand. "Name's Rayesh."

Sal reached forward and grabbed the man's wrist.

"Ah! A proper gentleman." Rayesh chuckled and returned the grip. "Come," he said, releasing Sal's wrist, "I think you'll like this."

The bridge was made of chrome-lined, black wood that gave way to a single curved sheet of glass. Sal walked to the front and peered through it. It wrapped around the fore half of the room, giving a full unobstructed view of the city. Beneath the glass were panels with knobs, handles, leads, and dozens of small lights which looked to be lit up at random.

He looked around and realized there were several stations, each with a different arrangement, and accompanied by a chair that was bolted to the floor. He knew this must be where they controlled the ship, but he had no idea how. This was nothing like the ships he and Roland used to dream of— there wasn't even a helm, a wheel, nothing he could see that would steer the ship.

"No doubt you're wondering how it works."

Sal turned to Rayesh and nodded.

"See this here," he pointed to a large, half sphere in the center of the middle panel. "We use this to steer the ship. Go ahead, you can touch it."

Sal examined it for a five seconds, trying to figure out how it worked. He opted to first twist the sphere, but it wouldn't budge.

Rayesh chuckled, "Not quite like that. See the leads?"

Sal leaned over, looked closely, and noticed small divots in the sphere. He nodded.

"The strength and relative intensity of energy fed into those leads is what determines how fast the ship will run and in what direction."

"How?"

Rayesh smirked. "Honestly, it's pretty simple," he leaned over and whispered, "but never say that to an engineer."

Sal returned a questioning gaze.

Rayesh shrugged, clearly enjoying his role. "It sucks in water and spits it back out, that's it— well, mostly it. There's several vents up fore which lead into a central, pressurized chamber. From there, a bunch of smaller vents lead out to various places aft. It's the where and intensity that determine direction and speed. See?"

Sal nodded even though he was pretty sure he had no idea what the man was talking about. "It drinks water and spits it out?"

Rayesh let out a hearty laugh, "Yes, yes, that's it." He leaned over again. "Wanna try?"

Sal backed away from the panel.

"Oh no, don't worry. The ship's not under power yet."

Rayesh took Sal's hand and led him to the helm-sphere-thing. Sal stretched his fingers to match them to the divots. He pushed energy through his finger tips, which was not something he was used to — most people use their palms — but he managed it and... nothing. The ship didn't move.

"Well." Rayesh had an expectant look on his face.

"Umm... neat?"

"Isn't it?" Rayesh looked out through the window with a distant expression, and Sal got the impression he wasn't seeing the city anymore. "Imagine, steering the ship, flying through the waves with nothing but your finger tips." He shook his head, eyes still distant. "There's nothing like it."

Sal turned from Rayesh, stared through the window, and tried to imagine the waves, dozens of feet tall, with the ship slicing through them, all led by his finger tips. He had to admit, it did sound nice.

A wet crunch sounded from behind him and Rayesh's head smashed against the panel.

Sal yelped and jumped back, just in time to see a knife slice where he'd been. He turned and saw the lady from before with a determined look on her face, knife in hand.

_She_ was the assassin?

Sal reached for his own but she swiped at him, forcing him to jump back. She followed it with a stab that he again had to dodge. He reached back again but her next swipe forced him to twist out of the way. She kept up a constant pressure of swipes, stabs, and feints. Every time he made to reach for his knife, she'd force him back with a flurry of motion.

"Impressive, kid, but not enough."

He jumped back to give himself room but hit the wall, startling him. He hadn't realized how much he'd be retreating. She grinned and started to advance.

"You're a horrible assassin," he said as he pushed and slid along the wall in an attempt to edge away.

"Is that so?" Her tone was sarcastic but he saw confusion in her eyes. If he had to guess, she'd expected crying and pleading, not professional criticism. At least, that's how he thought of it.

"Yes! I mean, your disguise is fantastic. I didn't guess it would be you, but then you had to completely blow it."

"I _blew_ it!?" she stopped and cocked her head, her confusion now quite evident. She jerked her head. "Kid you clearly don't understand the situation."

"The _problem_ is," he took a confident step forward, placing himself within her reach, "I should never have seen you at all. I _should_ be bleeding out on the floor right there," he gestured toward the crumpled body of the captain, then folded his arms behind him, all without allowing his attention to leave her. "I should be wondering what happened as my life drained from me. And our poor captain here should be in a near panic as he desperately calls out for help. Then you'd rush back into the room, maybe scream a little, panic a little, and run back out to get help. Nobody would have known.

"Instead, you bashed his head in; you actually let me _see_ you; and you didn't even knock captain out." Sal shook his head in disappointment. "It's just so sloppy."

She gaped at him, which was satisfying but not the point, and for a precious second he wondered if his gambit failed. Then it happened. After countless hours of training with a man preternaturally fast, it was quite possible that Sal had known her distraction before she did. A twitch of muscle, a shift of weight, the way her knife stilled— these all added up in Sal's mind instinctively, screaming at him that she was going to be distracted, she was going to be weak.

In the same moment her eyes shifted toward the captain, he was already moving to grab her arm. She flinched at his movement, jerking her knife hand up and back, which was exactly the direction he needed it to go. So he helped her. He pushed her arm up and thrust his knife up through her arm pit and into her shoulder, wedging it into the joint.

She gasped and stumbled back, dropping her knife. She reached over with her off hand but Sal forestalled her.

"I wouldn't if I were you. That knife is the only thing keeping your blood inside you." He had no idea if that was true, but it sounded good and might even be true; a lot blood had to go through the shoulder after all.

She hesitated as he walked slowly toward her, forcing her to back up. She was starting to pant, her eyes cloudy from the pain.

He gave her a polite smile. "I should also point out that I did understand the situation. I was never the victim and I was certainly never bait." He allowed his smile to show teeth. "I was the trap itself."

She probably could have killed him; she technically still had a knife while he was weaponless. But the situation had turned so suddenly the thought never occurred to her. Instead, she turned and ran straight into Djrek, bouncing off his chest.

Djrek's smile was genuine as he clapped slowly. The fear on the lady's face curdled into horror. She leveraged her good arm to scoot back, casting furtive glances toward the door until Ash entered from the hallway and leaned against the door frame, conveniently blocking it.

Ash had a smile that lacked it's characteristic smirk. She watched the blood drip down the lady's arm and pool around the floor. She looked at Sal for another second, then shifted to Djrek.

"Okay," she said, "I'll admit it. You were right... again."

Djrek grunted and knelt before the lady on the balls of his feet. "You and I should have a conversation," he said as he reached around and unfastened the sheath for her knife. He stood and took a step back. "But first we should probably clean you up a little."

"Clean up duty again," Ash grumbled as she pushed herself off the door frame.

"You can talk to her if you want," Djrek offered, smiling broadly.

Ash shuddered, "Gods no." She walked over and pulled the lady off the ground and set her on her feet, all using only a single hand the way a parent might a toddler. She put her hand on the lady's shoulder, who was staring at Ash with a very confused expression.

"Come on. Let's hope we don't have to amputate that arm to keep you alive," Ash said cheerfully as they walked off the bridge. The lady stumbled at those words, but Ash's hand our her shoulder made sure she didn't fall.

Djrek walked over, picked up the lady's knife, and examined it thoughtfully while Sal stepped up beside him. Djrek flipped it so that he held the tip and handed it to Sal hilt first.

"You earned it, I'd say."

Sal took the knife and examined it, frowning at the weight and design. It was much nicer than his and much heavier than he'd expected, given its size. The handle was wrapped in a quality leather cord, expertly done. The cross guard was simple but elegant, slightly curving out toward the blade. The blade, though, was a bit longer than Sal's and curved, which was troubling. The curve wasn't severe, but it certainly ruled the knife out as a stabbing weapon.

A moan drew Sal from his examination over to the captain, who pushed himself up to a sitting condition. The man tenderly touched his forehead. "What happened?"

Sal rolled his eyes. "So sloppy."

"Indeed," Djrek said, "and yet they managed to get her aboard the Ataran, which is no small feat." He turned to the captain, who had fixated on the puddle of blood near the center of the bridge. "What can you tell me of our host?"

Captain Rayesh stared at Djrek with blurred eyes. "Who?"

"The polite woman that showed us to our rooms."

"Ah," he blinked a couple times, "her. Raya contracted something on the way here, spent the whole trip in the privy. Ms..." he blinked again, "huh, don't quite recall her name, but she had all the right papers."

"I would be interested in those papers, Captain Rayesh, just as soon as you've recovered."

"Oh it's fine. Just a bump." Rayesh stood but had to catch himself on the panel to stay upright.

"Perhaps an hour, after you've had your head seen to. We need not leave immediately."

"Yes," Rayesh reached up and gingerly touched his head, "perhaps a quick jaunt to the doc would be in order."

Captain Rayesh pushed himself off the instrument panel and shuffled toward the door. He paused at the puddle of blood.

"I'll have that taken care of," he said into the air and kept on shuffling.

Djrek turned to Sal. "Thoughts?"

Sal lifted his knife. "It's not a stabbing weapon."

Djrek raised an brow.

"She stabbed with it."

"What does that tell you?"

Sal lowered the weapon to waist level, his eyes on it as he thought. "It wasn't wrong exactly. Her thrusts kept me off balance, but her style wasn't right for the blade. I don't know why." He angled the weapon back and forth. "It's a nice weapon but a little... pretty?"

"Perhaps ornamental?" Djrek offered.

Sal nodded while committing the word to memory. "She was here to kill a boy," he said. "She didn't need her weapons, maybe? But she wanted this one. It's special... perhaps something passed down?"

"A little weak, but not bad conjecture."

Sal pinched his lips, sheathed the weapon, and dropped his hand with sheathe, letting it dangle. He turned toward the blood on the floor.

"She tried to run away. She wasn't committed."

"And?"

"And," Sal sighed and stood, still looking at the blood, "I don't think she'll know much. She was either hired or threatened, but she wasn't part of the conspiracy."

He looked away from the blood to Djrek, who had a slight smile but said nothing, waiting patiently.

Sal pushed down a growl. "They missed. They'll try again, but with someone with more talent, I hope."

Drjek's smile turned amused. "You hope?"

Sal shrugged like it was no big deal to have assassins after him, but he still had to unclench his jaw to speak. "We need to know, and every time they try to kill me gives us another chance to figure it out."

He lifted the sheath and knife. "I need to know how to use this."

Djrek grinned. "We'll start immediately."
