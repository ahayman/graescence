# 30 | Echoes [Dia]

Kalina was practically skipping as Dia plodded along, huffing her way up the ramp to the next floor with an oversize pack strapped to her back. Her old pack had been stuffed inside as padding between the inscriber and her body. The larger backpack was on loan from Blackwater because the woman was paranoid someone would recognize the Inscriber, slit Dia's throat— _which did not seem to bother her_ —and then somehow trace it back to Blackwater and slaughter...everyone. For reasons.

_Even though no Royal would be caught dead traipsing about the lower floors._

She doubted most would even know what an Inscriber was, but Blackwater had been adamant that as few people as possible know about it, so whatever. The pack may have swallowed her whole, but at least it fit the Inscriber closer to Dia's body and thus pulled her less off balance.

Dia and Kalina climbed their way into a low carved, three story cavern market stretching leagues and covering over two dozen of the warrens. Columns of mottled gray stone flowed from floor to ceiling in regular intervals. Between them, wood-bound stone-shard stalls had sprouted, grown, and then aged into the floor itself. Glossy rivers of foot-worn stone branched sunken into the surrounding structures, giving them a raised feeling, as though the mountain had grown itself into the surrounding market.

They wove their way through a crowded bustle of unwashed humanity, past bartering shoppers and merchants hawking housewares, cheap food, and false trinkets. The shouts of merchant pleas punctuated a loud din of discordant conversations, merging into a background assault on the ears. Aromas of piss, sweat, and food drifted on humid currents of stifled air, lingering unpleasant on the tongue and teasing the stomach with both hunger and revulsion alike.

The pair pushed past faded hand-me-down styles of half a dozen eras mixed haphazardly, ill-fitting, threadbare, and dirty, the discarded remains of richer impulses. Soft stained robes warred with thin flowing wraps, ripped with age and folded to hide blemishes. Sturdy trousers worn thin clashed with once beautiful embroidered shirts, now blemished, discarded, picked through, and reused. Even hints of high fashion invaded the poor with stiff jackets, embossed lapels, long-split tails, and high-neck collars, all turned floppy with age and abuse.

The clash of styles blended together in uniform disrepair to make its own singular statement: poor. These people took what they could, when they could, and gave no heed to the fickle tides of higher minded fashion. It made Dia's attempt at modest attire standout and, to a lesser degree, Kalina's. Despite the dust-turned-mud by sweat soaked garments, their clothes still reflected a level of quality aberrant to the lower floors.

It earned them quite a few uncomfortable stares, some more considering than Dia liked. She began to reconsider Blackwater's paranoia as prudence. No one here would know what an Inscriber was, but none would miss the telltale ruddy glint of graetech. The looks some were leveling at her pack was enough to make her nervous.

Not that Kalina noticed. She was still dancing on her toes, flush with money, and eyeing displayed wares with gleeful consideration. Twice she made to stop, once at a small trinket store selling copper wrought into delicate shapes, another selling second-hand clothes of yesterday's styles, scrubbed clean.

Dia never faltered, mostly because she just might collapse if she stopped. While she didn't begrudge her friend's enthusiasm, much, her legs hurt. And her back. And her shoulders.

So no. She didn't stop to let Kalina peruse worthless trinkets. That didn't stop Kalina, who would slow and then, as though drawn taught by string, she'd snap back to Dia. Or prance as it were.

They walked a league that felt like two, then branched onto a well lit river of stone that flowed toward a wide staircase with shallow steps curving up to the next level in a lazy spiral. The stairs emptied onto a wide, low ceiling hallway that branched endlessly into smaller veins, each leading into the living blocs for this section of the mountain. Within each bloc would be hundreds of small apartments, all feeding off the air and water pushed into them by the columns beneath.

Kalina's sheen tarnished as they pushed further into the blocs, her face falling into somber tones. That spark never left her eyes, though, not like before.

_She still has to come home to an empty apartment._

Always before, she'd written off her friend's descent into melancholy as the withdrawal of adrenaline, or perhaps simple fatigue. Delving was hard; it made sense.

A brief flash of shame burned through her. She'd missed so many clues.

They both slowed as they approached a seemingly random, unlabeled hallway branching off at a narrow angle and slowly curving back around. The narrow walls framed receding darkness allowed by lights uncomfortably spaced, where a few people randomly loitered about or walked with purpose. This bloc did have a name— people always named where they lived— though Dia had never thought to ask. This was just part of 'the blocs' to her, and that was where Kalina lived.

It suddenly seemed unconscionable that she didn't know. She opened her mouth to ask, but Kalina broke the silence first.

"The boys are heading to Echoes later. You wanna come?"

Dia blinked long. "Echoes, really?"

"Yeah, sure. I know it's expensive and all, but..." Kalina shrugged, looking only a little sheepish.

"Do they know they can't just wear the slop they normally throw on?"

"Dia!"

"Sorry," Dia rolled her eyes, "some of my mom coming out."

"Malek knows. He's not actually an idiot, you know."

"I never said— err no, that's not right. I've definitely called him that. Well, I really don't think..." _Nope. Not true. He's an idiot._ "...hmm."

"Just take it easy on him."

"Well you're the one always bickering with him."

"Ha! Not the same. That's just our thing. And we don't bicker; we're not ten. We engage in... witty banter."

"...no." Dia slowly shook her head.

Kalina's eyes flashed up. "You coming or not?"

"Nooo..." Dia hesitated. "I really should start working on my thingy." She gestured to her pack.

"Ugh, you'll be working on that thing every waking moment for the rest of your life. We just had an incredible delve, Dia. Come celebrate with us!"

"I dunno, my mom probably has something planned or... something social." _Cause she always does._

"Dia! You never come out with us," Kalina pleaded. "Just this once, please?"

Dia wavered for a moment, until she remembered the tablet thingy she desperately wanted to read.

"I'm tired, Kalina, and this thing is heavy— really heavy." Dia's face scrunched up. "Can we just do it some other time?"

Kalina sighed into a disappointed head shake, looking a little hurt.

"Fine, whatever. Later."

Kalina turned and walked down the narrow hallway into her bloc. Dia's lips twisted as she watched her disappear into the darkness cast between distant lights, then reappear a moment later further down.

"We'll see each other in a couple of days!" Dia called after her.

"Yeah," the reply echoed back Kalina's disappointment.

Dia watched her for a few more seconds before the burning in her shoulders quite soundly beat out the guilt churning in her stomach. She still had a long way to walk. She took a deep breath and continued down the main hall. At least this hall was well lit, though she always felt uncomfortable walking the blocs alone.

The blocs weren't exactly dangerous, at least not the main halls. But gazes always seemed to linger longer than they should, sizing her up, judging. Men especially, and while Kalina might invite that sort of attention, Dia couldn't keep the very specific warnings her father had given her from devolving her imagination into nightmarish scenarios.

And she stood out; she knew that. Her mother would never let her wear the kind of clothes she would need to truly blend in here, and so she was marked as from above simply because her plain clothes were of quality, obvious even beneath the dirt and grime collected from delving. No, her clothes were from above, that was indisputable, and that alone marked her as... vulnerable? Or something.

She hated this walk.

Dia wove her way down the hall at a brisk pace, careful to maintain distance from the sparse groups and individuals loitering, the trash randomly littered about, questionable puddles she tried hard not to think about. Every part of her felt obtuse. Even the way she walked, avoiding others, screamed "I don't belong here." She hated that, but she couldn't bring herself to not weave far around everyone else.

Twenty tense minutes later the hallway turned into a wide, carved staircase curving upward. Twenty people could walk abreast without issue. Dia hugged the inside, taking a measured pace up the stairs while trying to ignore the burning in her legs.

A floor of the blocs opened up every time the stairs wrapped around. With every ascending floor, things got better: better lighting, less trash, less questionable personages, no weird puddles, less stench. The top two floors of the blocs might even be considered nice, decent perhaps from a certain perspective.

Vague childhood memories danced along the edges of her mind, drawn by distant familiarity from when she'd lived here as a child, a time her mother would just as well erase from existence if she could.

The top floor was a weirdly underdeveloped natural cavern lit by a dim yet defuse light. A forest of glossy stalagmites forever reached upward toward cousins who'd long since abandoned the effort. Many had broken, only to be rounded off and turned into pedestals between which children could leap. Two of the larger stalagmites had been carved into steps that ascended almost two stories before leveling off onto a small railed platform. On the opposite side, a metal slide was connected, wrapping around the entire edifice twice before emptying out onto a grit floor. Steel bars stretched between many of the pillars. From the taller ones had been hung chains, upon which were attached a variety of swingeable instruments.

Dia slowed to watch a little girl try to carefully balance walk across one of the lower bars. She made it a third of the way before falling, earning laughter from her friends. The next kid made it almost halfway before suffering the same fate. The third kid, though, had a different idea. He tried to run across the bar. He almost made it before his foot slipped, sending him careening into the pillar. Dia winced as his upper body folded over the top. He made a weak effort climb up, but he was struggling to breath and ended up falling back to the floor instead.

"No No _No!_" a mother's voice echoed. "What did I tell you about running across the bars?"

The boy tried to reply twice before he managed to get anything out of, but Dia couldn't hear it.

"You made what?" The mother's face flattened. "_No._ You do not run across the bars. Do it again and we leave."

The mother turned and walked away, shaking her head, to rejoin a cluster of bemused adults ostensibly watching the kids as they chatted. The gaggle of children devolved into a heated argument about whether the latest attempt counted as success while they aimed toward one of the slides.

A hundred memories pressed in from the edges of Dia's mind and blurred into nostalgia. Here was where she'd befriended Kalina, a bossy girl who kept trying to organize her peers into playing games with rules only she knew. Dia never cared about the games, and Kalina never cared that Dia didn't want to play, often dragging her into whatever idea she'd come up with.

Dia rolled her eyes and kept walking. _Not much has changed, has it?_

Beyond the playground the cave grew thick with stratified formations, flowing rock curtains, waterfalls, and ribbons permanently froze in time, visible on the edges of light. The ceiling disappeared far above, creating a sky of impenetrable darkness. Lights embedded into the path floor cast deep shadows into a forest of stone. Satin columns rose into the darkness, disappearing into an eternal night.

Dia had no idea how far the stone forest stretched. The path she followed meandered through it, rising and falling across angled slabs, shelves, and platforms, sometimes smoothed out, other times carved into steps. Smaller unlit paths branched off to places unknown, old places long forgotten, dead parts of the mountain. _Dangerous parts_. Some even approached the delving columns with their... hazards, and that without loot.

Not many travelled these paths, and her parents would be utterly aghast to discover their precious princess braving this dangerous forest filled with... hooligans, thugs, and all sorts of other unscrupulous types, eager to take advantage of some innocent teen wandering into their evil domain.

...except there was none of that. Nobody came down here from above— there was no point. Nor did those from the blocs ever venture here because, again, there was no point. The markets were in the opposite direction and, as far as Dia knew, very few were aware you could use the forest as a shortcut between the blocs and what was colloquially known as 'the crack', a vast residential district for the middle class. Those who did know probably didn't care.

Dia had not once seen another person travel the forest. So it was a shock when a glint of light pulled her eyes to the side.

Only to see two eyes of darkness staring back at her atop their stalks.

She froze as adrenaline fueled panic slammed into her, sending her heart racing right up into her throat. Instinct drove shaky hands to her pockets in search of her lamp. But it wasn't there. She had no light, nothing. If she moved, she died, just like...

_Blank eyes staring up at her in hate, a mouth full of blood, that tongue endlessly pushing it out, a gaping hole in the chest._

_No!_ She squeezed her eyes shut. Bots don't come up here. They can't. She had to repeat it to herself several times.

Dia opened her eyes and stared at two misshapen stalagmites.

She gasped out in relief and almost collapsed. "Oh gods, they don't even look like— ah... okay, okay. I'm okay."

Dia forced herself to swallow. Then she forced herself to walk before her legs gave out. Shadows seemed to shift within the forest, _tricks of the light_, while suddenly what little light lit the path darkened. _But it's just my imagination. Nothing has changed._

She picked up her pace, and then again until she was almost running along the path. She knew she was being ridiculous— she'd walked this path dozens of times now —but she couldn't slow down. That fear, that _panic_, in the back of her mind drove her forward as firm as a knife to her back.

For twenty minutes she half ran, half stumbled down the path while the muscles in her body burned. Twice she slipped and once she fell, scrambling back to her feet in a surge of irrational panic as the columns of lumpy stone around her leaned in, threatening to smother her, suffocate her in the dark. The closer she got to her destination, the more the darkness seemed to grow, the shadows seemed to shift around her, light sparks dancing her eyes, obscuring the path.

As she rounded the last bend, she was terrified it wouldn't be the end, that she'd somehow missed the real path and was doomed to wonder the forest of stone until she died. It was an irrational, stupid fear— she knew where she was. She knew this path. She _knew_ it.

But terror whispered dark words in here ear.

And then suddenly she was there. She stumbled against the stone wall of the cave and doubled over to catch her breath, one hand raised to lean on the wall in support while the other was on her knee.

Next to her was a plain but solid wood door inset into the wall. Above it a single graetech floodlight spilled down its luminance in a small semicircle around the entrance.

She stared down at the sharp shadow she cast on the floor while her breath and heart slowly receded back to a sane pace. Once she'd recovered enough, she spared a glance back toward the forest, but the floodlight blinded too much, and she saw only darkness punctuated by weak floor light receding into the distance.

She turned back to the door. Affixed to it was a brass metal handle and above it a simple graetech lock pad.

_Three by three grid, four-digit code, no double entries, six-second delay, and—_

She forced the information out of her head. She didn't need it. She already knew the code, had cracked it a long time ago.

Still she hesitated, because what was beyond that door was... well, there was a very good reason nobody ever took this path, aside from the locked door that is.

Dia took two very deep breaths, entered the code, and pulled the door open.

She was immediately assaulted by warm, humid air that sought to invade every poor of her being. She tried not to breathe, but it didn't matter. The sulfur filled scent of fermenting human waste slithered into her mouth and nose regardless, bringing tears to her eyes and sending her stomach broiling.

With practiced effort, she shoved down the bile her stomach and began walking through one of the many digestive systems of the mountain. A long corridor of flaking white paint was broken up by doors set at regular intervals. Behind each door was a pool of fermenting waste and filled with a very specific cocktail of bacteria designed to breakdown just about any organic matter. Eventually, it would start down through endless shale and filter stone before somehow making its way out into one of the rivers leading out into the sea. As clean water. Theoretically. Dia had doubts.

_Ten minutes of walking. Just ten minutes..._

The humid air had condensed into beads of dew on the walls and floor, making it just a little slippery. She had to try hard not to think about what was in those beads of water, or the air. _Especially the water in the air._

After every fifth door, a new corridor branched off, looking exactly the same as the one she strode through. If she arced her head, she could see even more corridors branching off of those. The place was massive, though she'd never tried to explore it. Nor would she ever.

Technically, she wasn't supposed be down here, but none of the workers who saw her ever cared. They did give her strange looks on occasion, but that was it. She would return their look with a pitying smile, all while wondering which of the old gods they had offended to be so consigned to such a fate.

The long corridor eventually ended in a narrow staircase that wound its way up five floors before emptying out into the lowest level of the 'crack'. Dia stumbled out the door, legs shaking and utterly spent, and let the door close itself. She leaned back against the door and stared out while her breath slowly levelled out.

Beyond was a low, rough stone ceiling of natural layered granite that angled about thirty degrees off to the right. The floor was parallel to the ceiling, and so a narrow path had been carved level, extending fifty paces out until it opened up into a large ravine who's opposite wall was hundreds of paces out.

The only light was the orange glow of the sun, spilling in from above the ravine.

Except it was a lie.

There was no sun here. Instead, a series of powerful and oddly long graetech lights set far above shifted their colors throughout the day, giving them the illusion of a sun's progress. Dia had never seen the sun or the sky, but leaning back against the door, she could trick herself into thinking it was just beyond, right there in the light, almost within reach.

She sighed and pushed herself off the door before exhaustion drove her to sleep.

She blinked her eyes repeatedly when she stepped out into the ravine. Homes, stores, and markets of carved stone stretched over a thousand paces above her before disappearing into a light too strong to look at directly. The first ten or so floors were modest single story homes with a single market layer sandwiched halfway through. Above those were double story homes with fluted columns, small patios, and sculpted roofs. Stairs periodically broke the layers, allowing access from one level to the next. Between the two cliffs arced bridges linking the two sides, their rails sculpted into a variety geometric patterns. Greenery began peeking out from over railings some ways up to soak up the light, growing thicker the higher she looked.

Ravine's Respite. _Not_ "the crack", or at least not in front her mother. She hated the slang of the lower levels and had forbidden its use. Dia similarly hated the stupid alliteration, but she had no authority to forbid anything.

Dia made her way along the bottom of the ravine, which was almost entirely a maintenance level. Rough utilitarian doors decorated the cliff base in uneven intervals, disappearing beyond the ravine's curve. Each door led to... storage maybe? Dia didn't know or care. While the ravine extended for a full two leagues, her main concern was the lift about half a league down.

Dia walked slowly, shoulders slumped in exhaustion. She glanced up at the light shining above, slowly degrading bright whites into deeper oranges to signal the day's end.

It was getting late. Too late. Her mother would be home by now.

Anxiety slowly began to tie knots beneath her sternum. She'd never come home so late before, certainly not after her mother. The delve, while wildly successful, was the longest she'd had... and she couldn't hide it. She had nowhere to clean herself up, no way to pretend she was doing something else.

_Maybe I can just tell her the... truth?_

"Mom, I'm a delver," Dia said out loud, tasting the words. Bitter words. She unconsciously slowed to stop as she tried to imagine her mother's response.

_Oh no. No no no. Nope._ She shook her head vigorously. _Gonna have to lie. No choice, not if I want to ever leave the house again. It's the only sane thing to do._

She began walking again.

_Okay, but what would work?_

"Oh my pack? These are just school books!"

_Meh, although...the books are horrendously heavy. Might work. Still, hard to explain all the dirt._

"This? Oh, I just fell down... and rolled in the mud. A lot. Cause... reasons?"

_Ugh._

"So I was playing with my friends and—"

_And what? We started throwing mud at each other, doesn't that sound great!_

"Gaaaa... no."

Some maintenance worker walking the opposite direction gave her a concerned look. She rolled her eyes at him and kept walking.

_Wait! Maybe if I just break down into tears she won't ask!_ She thought about it for a second before huffing annoyance. _No, she'll still ask, if only cause she doesn't like my friends, and she'll wonder what... they... oh!_

"I know it looks bad mom, but _you_ wanted me to make friends at school, right? So I tried, _just like you asked_ and, well, they have this whole... I dunno, hazing thing, but it's alright cause they all do it, I guess." Dia plastered an exhausted look on her face— it wasn't hard —then she shifted it into that whiney look her mother hated. "Can we just not talk about it? It's fine. I made friends, and now I just want to clean up."

She slowed down and started ticking off her fingers.

_Let's see. First, you throw it in her face and make seem like it was her fault. That should throw her off. Then you make it sound like you succeeded, so she's still getting what she wants. Finally, you suggest the very course of action she would ask you to do anyway. That way she won't pry, cause if she does, she risks derailing you from the task. Add the whiney look for extra motivation to leave me alone._

"Yeah..." a grin split her face, "yeah, that might work."

The entrance to the lift was a pair of sliding double doors made of worn wood bound together by brass. The lift itself was similarly adorned, a wide open space mostly used to transport supplies and maintenance workers. There were only two lifts this size, both of which were the only lifts that serviced the full height of the ravine, even if they only stopped every five levels. They were rarely used by most residents, who generally took advantage of the smaller lifts designed to ferry people among the more popular areas.

Dia leaned against the wall to wait. The lift should arrive every twenty minutes. As she waited, a half a dozen workers began to slowly filter in, likely done with their day's work. Most of them stood about idly until a woman dressed in a thick jumpsuit walked over. At her approach, Dia heard a few muffled curses and groans as the others quickly moved to give her space.

Dia looked at them, confused until the woman walked by and Dia almost gagged at the miasma dragged along in the woman's wake. To her horror, the woman didn't walk far, choosing to lean against the wall only a couple paces from Dia.

_Shallow breaths. Breathe through your mouth, just like down below— oh, she probably works there._

Dia stole a side glance at the woman, only to find her watching Dia with interest.

_Oh no. Please don't talk to me. I'm not interesting. Just don—_

"You almost look as dirty as I smell."

Dia barked out a small laugh despite herself. She caught herself, sighed, shook her head, then shrugged dismissively.

"No really." the woman said altogether too loudly, "I can't figure you out."

Dia turned her head to give the woman a quizzical look.

"Well, it's usually easy to figure what a woman does by how they look. Consider these fine gents over—"

"Hey!" said a woman standing over to the side.

The loud smelly woman— _Ms Smelly_ —gave the other one a wry smile. "Yara, you still look like a boy."

The other woman returned a rude gesture, which only seemed to make Ms Smelly happier.

"But you? You I can't figure. What'ya do, crawl through a sewer? Cause I can smell you, and I can't smell nothing anymore— wait, is that blood in your hair?"

"What!? No!" Dia's eyes flashed in horror. She grabbed at her hair and pulled it forward. It was clumped together, almost like—

Dia threw her other hand over her mouth as bile rose in her throat.

"Uh, please don't chuck up here," Ms Smelly said with an oddly contrite tone. "They'll make me clean it up."

Dia swallowed hard and shook her head vigorously.

"It's mud." Dia said, "It's just mud."

"Uh huh." Ms Smelly took a cautious step back.

Salvation came in the form of two doors sliding open. Dia did not lunge for them, or not entirely at least. She planted herself into the far corner of the lift and waited. The operator, a rail-thin older man with stooped poise, barely glanced at her.

Ms Smelly came in next. "Barak," she said jovially.

Barak grunted a wordless reply and waited as three more people joined. His brow drew down after a few seconds. He leaned out. At the sight of everyone else not entering the lift, he glanced back at Ms Smelly and scoffed. He rolled his eyes, shaking his head in that kind of "utter disappointment in humanity" that only old people seem capable of truly conveying.

Dia had no idea if they were skipping the lift because of her or Ms Smelly who, for some reason, had lost her wariness and seen fit to stand only two paces from Dia. At least she wasn't staring anymore.

"Really?" Barak said in a tired tone, again expressing supreme disappointment toward the group.

It was guilt enough for a few of them to enter the lift, though they stood as far away from the pair as possible.

"Nya uh," Yara shook her head. "Last time I got near that one, hubby refused to twix my—"

"Right then," Barak said loudly while feeding a small device that closed the doors.

He then grabbed hold of a fixed handle and began feeding it graescence.

_One lead split to two cores and four spring-loaded clamps. Each core embedded into notched rails set in opposite sides of the lift walls. Leads keep the clamps open and—_

Dia blinked away the knowledge as the lift began to smoothly accelerate. She already knew how it worked— it was keeping the knowledge out of her head that was the problem, like a catchy song that refused to leave.

After a few seconds, the lift slowed. A loud thump signalled the catches latching onto the wall.

"Five," Barak intoned as he opened the doors.

"See ya!" Ms Smelly said to Dia in an overly familiar tone. "Hope you get your shit figured out!"

Dia watched her leave in utter consternation. Two others followed, leaving just Barak, Dia, and a large man who had leaned his head back to stare at the ceiling, completely disinterested in anyone else.

That man left at floor ten, at which point Barak turned to Dia, acknowledging her for the first time.

"Floor?"

Dia blinked and, caught off guard, it took her a few seconds to process. "Uh... twenty..."

"You sure?"

"Of course, yes, it's floor twenty."

_Why is he asking?_ Operators normally follow a preset route.

Her question was answered when they blew right past floor fifteen to stop at twenty.

He opened the doors and gave her an impatient look. Dia fled the lift. She turned around as the doors closed and realized...

_He's going to go back down and restart the route. I... don't know how I feel about that._

She stared at the closed doors for a moment before realizing her mind was drifting. She shook off the fog and began to make her way down the street.

Small sculpted trees lined the railing side, evenly spaced, forever constrained by semi-permanent stone planters and light that while sufficient, still lacked the abundance of a real sun. Occasionally, a community approved planter supported growing vegetables.

On her left, fluted columns bracketed narrow two-story town homes barely wide enough for two rooms, though Dia knew many of them had dug deep into the mountain for extra space. All were painted in a variety of desaturated colors that, while somewhat diverse, still adhered to a common color scheme that managed to make every house feel the same.

This time of day was crowded as a well-dressed crowd made their way home from whatever jobs occupied them, although most of them will be working for the Mai family— it was the entire reason her family lived here. As a small arms broker, her father benefited heavily from the connections her mother made via her "social engagements".

Dia edged toward the railing after a few glares of disdain were levelled against her audacity to walk in public in such a state. A bubble of space had formed around her, with people veering off course at either the sight or smell of her.

She lowered her head and ignored the attention, forging on toward the closest staircase. From there she climbed two full floors which, considering the size of the floor and the buffer between them, took just about everything she had left in her. By the time she reached the top her breath struggled and her legs wobbled like gelatin.

The homes on this floor, while still only two stories, were wider than those below, reflecting the unassailable truth of social stratification within the mountain: the higher you climb, the better things were.

Her home had been painted fuchsia, and though it too had been desaturated to match the neighborhood color scheme, it still stuck out. Her mother had somehow managed to find the one color that would announce to the world "here I am" without breaking the rules.

The neighbors hated it, calling it the "pink abomination", a sentiment Dia wholeheartedly agreed with.

The entrance had been enlarged to support double doors of polished wood bound by distressed brass. They gave entrance to an oversized foyer of gold-streaked white marble that rose the full two stories to a ceiling from which an elaborately carved graetech chandelier hung, supporting no less than twelve individual lamps.

Two staircases wrapped around each side of the foyer to meet up at a small balcony, beyond which a door in the back led to the family bedrooms. Below were two doors, one leading to the parlor, the other leading to father's office.

Dia paused in the foyer and listened carefully. The door was unlocked, so her mother was home, but _where_ was deeply important.

_If she's in the parlor entertaining guests and I walk in like this, it's all over. My life is done. She'll never let me leave the house again._

Upstairs was safer, but she couldn't keep the inscriber in her room. She wasted precious second before finally making her choice.

She walked to the parlor and cracked the door open as quietly as possible.

She listened. Nothing.

She let out a sigh of relief and walked through a room with an elaborate tea table and chairs surrounding it. Dia froze at the sight of hot tea steaming from a kettle.

_Ah shit shit shit shit._

Dia pushed through the parlor and into the dining room beyond. Also clad in the same marble facade as the foyer, an oversize polished oak table dominated the room, with no less than twelve chairs perfectly spaced around it.

_No food, though, so I've got some time left..._

The back corner of the dining room exited into the kitchen via a small hallway, intentionally arranged so that glimpsing the kitchen was impossible.

There was a reason for that. The kitchen had none of the pretension of the prior rooms, with unpainted stone walls, utilitarian tools, and unstained wood counters. Several dishes were being kept warm by cheap heat lamps on one of the counters, filling the room with an aroma that almost sent Dia to her knees.

Dia skirted the edge of the kitchen to a door on the opposite side, trying desperately to ignore the gnawing in her stomach. This led to a storage room that ran parallel the kitchen. At the very end of it was another small door that at first glance appeared to lead back into the kitchen. Instead, a staircase behind the kitchen led to a basement.

Dia's parents had never stepped foot in it. Never. Not even once. Nor would they. It was filled with the discarded refuse of a past they both sought desperately to escape. Old wooden chairs perilously stacked next to a wooden table
so scratched up it almost looked intentional. A long run of shelves left over from the previous owner held mostly dust. A bed single sized frame stood up on end, one leg broken.

Must and cold damp stirred as Dia quickly entered, dropped her pack, and bounded back up the stairs without bothering to turn on a light, more relying on memory than vision.

Freed of her heavy burden, she raced back through the storage room, the kitchen, the dining room, the parlor, and was at the top of the stairs before tragedy struck.

Her mother was wearing her "host" clothes, a carefully arranged ensemble designed to give the impression of an upwardly mobile family without infringing on the styles of the truly rich. A stiff collar hinted at the kind of jacket currently the rage among Royals, yet instead flowed into an embroidered sleeved corset accentuating a carefully maintained figure. Flowing pants that might be mistaken as a dress ended just above the ankle, revealing the elegant sandals that wrapped them. Those matched a black fedora— also a Royal fashion —cocked off center.

Each element was carefully considered to send a message. Hinting at Royal fashion exposed ambition. The corset was more traditional, and that spoke of heritage. Pants were also a Royal fashion, but the flowing style was more in line with the island theme favored by Caldonians.

"Oh good, there you— oh!" Dia's mother staggered back as though struck. She blinked twice as though she were dreaming this apparition of horror before her.

"What happened to— ogh," her hand flew to her mouth as she gagged, "that smell. What is—" her eyes widened in sudden horror. "Oh gods, tell me you did not walk through the parlor. Please, Nelendria. You didn't."

Dia froze. "Oops?"

"Oh gods no," her mother said in utter despair. Then just as suddenly they lit up. "Incense! I need to fi— you!" Her head snapped back to Dia, "wash yourself now."

"That was the idea."

"Oh and wear the yellow shirt I bought you last month. Pair it with the black skirt. That should complement what your father is wearing."

"Wait what? No—"

"The Makai family is coming in an hour," her mother continued, "and you will be presentable _in every form._ I don't care if you use steel to scrub the stench from you. They have a son about your age and—"

"No!"

"Nelendria, this is not a discussion."

"But... no, its— I just promised my new friends I'd go to Echoes."

"Echoes?" Her mother's eyes narrowed. _That's right mom, exactly the kind of place you like._ "What new friends?"

_Hooked._

"You were the one asking me to make friends at school. So I did. Or, well, I tried, I guess. They had this hazing thing, I dunno, they all did it I guess, but I'm 'in' or whatever that means, and they invited me. I can't just not go now, I promised."

Dia watched her mother's face closely. _Surprise, guilt, confusion, suspicion, oh and now back to guilt, more suspicion, dismissal and... ah, we're hitting acceptance. It's now or never._

"Mom, I'm tired, and I still have this whole thing at Echoes I have to go to and I really, _really_ want to wash," _probably the only true thing I've said— now go for the throat,_ "but if you don't want me to go, I guess I could just stay here instead. I am pretty tired after all..."

_Ah, there it is: alarm verging on panic. Gotcha!_

"No no no," her mother shook her head, her confusion suddenly giving way to delight, "you're right to go to Echoes. Do you need money? What am I saying, of course you do. Come see me after you've washed."

Dia stared at her a second with wide eyes. _That worked!?_ "Right."

"Nelendria, I'm proud of you." She almost sounded surprised to say it.

Her mother took a step forward, almost looking as though she might hug her daughter. Dia stepped back in alarm. Her mother jerked as she realized what she'd been about to do. So instead, she stared at her daughter, fondly, _awkwardly._

_Oh gods, please make it stop._

They did, though it was in spite. Her mother's face shifted from fond to lecture so quickly Dia's head spun.

"Now Nelendria, I understand the whole hazing thing is a right of passage, but you need to understand it can also be a form of dominance. The first thing you must do is create allies within the group."

"Mom," Dia whined, twisting her brow up.

"No, this is important. I'm afraid your prior 'friends' may have left you bereft of the proper social skills needed to handle people of your station. If you've been paying attention, you should have noticed there are girls on 'top', or the ones in power. They make the decisions. There's usually one primary click but there could be more, depending on the size of the group. You have two options: first, you can make nice with those in power. This can work, but more likely you'll be looked down on for trying. Second— and this is what I would do —you can find girls on the out and create your own click. No! Do not interrupt."

Dia's mouth clacked shut. Her mother sped on as though trying to dump out something she'd been wanting to say for years.

"Listen, this is important. Power is an illusion. It is a thing _you_ create by getting others to defer to you. Power given to you can be taken away, which is why fawning over the popular girls is always a loosing game. You're giving them power instead of taking it for yourself. The more people who gather around you, the more power you have. Now at first you won't have much power at all, but even a little power attracts, especially if you're seen as a rising star. So start small, build from there."

"Mom."

"You only need a couple, maybe three, and you'll have an excellent base to build off of. It can be hard cause people don't really know you yet, but there's ways around that. Like... uh, bribes." Her mom's eyes flashed. "Never underestimate how much a bribe can get you— of course you don't want to call it that. Just tell them you saw this piece of jewelry or whatever, and it made you think of them—"

"_Mom._"

"In fact, I'll give you extra money. Go to the market before Echoes and grab three gifts. Try to make sure they match the girl's interests. I'm sure you know the girls I'm talking about. There's always at least three in a group like that. They tend to feel overlooked, so maybe find something pretty, something that'll make them feel special. But not too expensive or it'll feel like—"

"_MOM!_"

Her mother blinked. "What?"

"I really need to wash up."

"Oh yes. Yes you do— oh incense!" Her mother turned to walk away— specifically to go down the other staircase, the one away from Dia —but then paused. She turned back.

"Nelendria, I really am proud of you."

And wow were those words like a knife twisting in her gut.

_But what if I just want to have real friends?_

"I... thank you, mom."

Her mother hesitated a moment, then seemed to make up her mind. She walked over and placed her hand on Dia's cheek, visibly ignoring the smell and dirt.

"I love you. You will go far; I know you will." _She looks so... happy._ "No go wash up," her mother patted her cheek. "You've got a great night ahead of you!"

Dia nodded and walked toward the door while her mother continued down the stairs. Beyond the door was a dark hallway. Dia closed the door behind her and leaned back against it, closing her eyes.

_That was intense._

Guilt and anger warred within her. Lying to her mother was second nature and didn't bother her in the least. _Hells below, she'd probably be proud if she found out how well I lie._ No, lying wasn't the problem. It was the happiness she saw in her mother's eyes that drove deep the dagger.

And anger because her mother's happiness was Dia's hell.

_But I will never be like that._

It was an oath she'd made so many times the words had become thin enough to see through to the doubt fueling them.

On habit, she reached out and fed the panel, causing the hallway to light up dimly. Each home in the neighborhood got an allotment of graescence, and anything beyond that allotment had to come from the people living there. It was enough to light a few lights, heat the water, cook— it met most people's needs. It was also just enough to light a chandelier with twelve lights, the parlor with another six, and another two chandeliers in the dining room, with just enough left over to light the kitchen. It was everything they needed to appear richer than they were.

The hallway was sparse, unpainted stone. Two ordinary unstained wooden doors stood either side, with a final door at the end, all belying the opulence she now leaned against. Dia pushed off it and walked to the bathroom on the left. She began stripping in the dark for about twenty seconds before she couldn't take it anymore. Even here, in a place she knew intimately, she couldn't bear that suffocation. She slapped the light panel and shoved her graescence into it.

Relieved at the light, she let the rest of her cloths drop to the floor before stumbling to the shower. She stared at the heat panel for a long time before opting for a cold shower instead. Not only was she far too tired to push that much graescence, but a warm shower just might just lull her to sleep.

She need not have worried.

Dia stepped in and gasped at the cold. Her breath quickened as water began to pull at the grime covering her. She watched as black and brown rivulets circled the drain. The water began to pull at her hair and those rivulets turned red.

Her face twisted. Her breathing became gasps as she collapsed to her knees and began to sob. The water continued, ruthlessly washing off the evidence of her guilt even as the day's horrors echoed endlessly through her mind.
