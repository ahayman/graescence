# 48 | Bait [Sal]

The gate room, like most of the city, was made of stone. It was circular, perhaps fifty paces wide, with a domed ceiling and recessed blue-tinted spotlights aimed at the center of the room, leaving the edges cast in shadow. A stone circular platform, thirty paces wide and a full pace in height, dominated the center of the room. Double doors closed on a space twenty paces high and twice that in width, large enough to accommodate a drajin and its sled. A ramp led from the door to the platform at a gentle incline.

Sal looked around in confusion as they followed a young man double-wrapped in expensive-looking red and brown silks. They tightly banded his chest, crisscrossed down his torso, and flared out from his hips to drape down to his ankles, almost like a robe. They were impractical and comic looking and the man looked like a skinny duck dressed up as a peacock. He even walked like one.

"Where's the gate?" Sal's voice echoed through the room.

The peacock stopped halfway up the ramp, turned, and looked around in confusion, jerking his head very much as though the room itself had spoken to him. His eyes darted over Sal's head first, went out into the room, then to Ash, then to Djrek, back over Sal's head, and only then did he suddenly seem to notice the boy; his eyes flinched in surprise. He opened his mouth, but stopped; he turned his focus to Djrek, head cocked.

It was the first time the man had noticed Sal existed. It was absurd; Sal had been standing with Djrek and Ash as the peacock argued with them the inviolate sanctity of the line, something not even Inquisitors should defile, apparently. The argument had lasted five minutes and twenty three seconds before that very line's denizens, all rich merchants or Royals, rebelled against his holiness with a surprising amount of profanity, all admonishing the peacock to, for fuck's sake, just let the Inquisitors through. Even that may not have been enough, but while the peacock had been arguing with Djrek, Ash had directed the two hotel porters to take their bags on ahead. With that, the peacock finally gave up his crusade.

Now he glared at Djrek, who in turn met his eyes patiently, waiting. This lasted for twelve seconds, during which the peacock blinked eleven times.

Djrek smiled politely and raised his brow. "A valid question, I think."

The peacock blinked. "Ah, yes, well, of course, a common ah... misconception," he said in a tone that firmly suggested otherwise. He turned to Sal. "Travellers don't use gates; we use anchors to form gates." He blinked again, jerked his head in a nod, then turned on his heal and began walking toward the platform.

Djrek, though, hadn't moved. He turned to Sal, his smile shifting from polite to amused. He didn't say anything, but waited for Sal's inevitable question.

"What's an anchor?" Sal's voice echoed through the chamber.

The peacock somehow froze mid-step in an admirable display of balance. He slowly lowered his foot, then turned back to the trio. His eyes widened at seeing them in the exact place he'd left them. He turned an exasperated expression on Djrek, who raised an eyebrow at the peacock and once again waited.

The peacock's shoulders deflated, perhaps finally realizing that Inquisitors could not be rushed.

"An anchor is a piece of..." he cocked his head, "technology?" he nodded, "Yes, tightly controlled technology, rare technology the Empire of course _can_ produce but for some reason never does produce, which leads to the inevitable question of whether they... actually... can..."

He trailed off; even he could see Djrek's smile had turned dangerous. He blinked slow, giving Sal the impression that he used those blinks to reset his own thoughts.

He inhaled sharply and turned back to Sal. "Travellers are very special individuals who can form a resonance with an anchor, a very long and arduous process that allows us to form gates— ah... some call them portals— from anywhere in the world—"

Djrek coughed, causing the peacock to flinch.

He blinked again. "Perhaps not anywhere— or, well, some older travellers could do it, maybe..." his eyes flicked to Djrek's implacable smile; he huffed. "So, when a traveller forms a resonance, it takes up... space? Yes, space— a good word. When you're young, you can only bind a single anchor, or perhaps two if you're unusually talented."

He stopped, looked at Djrek, then Ash, then back to Sal, his face expectant, seeming to wait for something? It took Sal six seconds to realize what.

"You've formed two." He said slowly.

"Yes! Indeed I have, young man. Quite intelligent you are, and quite right, two of them. Very rare— very few can do that." He nodded to himself and seemed lost in thought.

"Space?" Sal drew out the word into a question.

The peacock's eyes refocused on Sal. "Right, space. They take up space, a lot of it, but less the more you use it..." he trailed off, again.

Wow. "Okay, so if they take up less space the more you use it, then eventually you can resonate with more?"

"Yes, yes! We could, but then we couldn't go very far."

It was Sal's turn to blink slowly, trying to process the man's scattered thoughts.

"I think," Djrek said, "what our prestigious teacher here is trying to say, is that by binding a new anchor, it makes using any of their anchors harder, diminishing the distance they can travel to any one of them."

"Yes, that is what I said." The peacock nodded. "You see, I have anchors to Castel and Andriel, a very rare feat for one my age, but I could not travel from Castel to Andriel. No, too far. But I _can_ travel from here to either city. You see?"

"You don't have an anchor here?"

"No no no, of course not. I mean, I _could_, perhaps even now, but then I'd have to walk halfway to either of them just to form a gate." He let out a staccatic laugh that somehow matched the rhythm of its own echo in the hall. "That... ah, that would be ridiculous."

How much time did he spend in this room?

"Wait, so you have anchors you can't really use because you'd be stuck?"

"Stuck? Why would I be stuck?"

"You don't have an anchor here. I mean, how would you get back?"

The peacock's mouth dropped, as though Sal had said the dumbest thing in the world.

"I don't, no," he said slowly, "but I'm not the only traveler in the world."

Sal flushed in embarrassment and firmly shut his mouth before another stupid question left it. The peacock seemed to take the silence as confirmation. He jerked his head in a nod that Sal suspected was the man's attempt to signal an end to the conversation. He turned, again on his heal, and began waking back up the ramp. This time, Djrek moved to follow.

The platform itself was mostly polished stone with engravings embedded in it. An outer ring of elaborately decorated circles were engraved along the edge, each unique but randomly placed, with a tight script inside them. Long triangular arrows, each with their own elaborate designs, formed an inner ring from the circles. They at first appeared to have no relation to the outer ring until Sal realized they were paired to each other opposite side of the platform with matching designs. Within those dashes were writing, and while Sal couldn't read the most of them, the one nearest to him said Castel in a flowery script. At the exact center of the platform were very narrow razor-thin strokes that looked much deeper than the engravings, seemed to match the circle-arrow pairings, and created a kind of star in the center of the platform.

The peacock walked over circle nearest the door, faced the center of the room and, by extension, the dash that Sal was now certain had Andriel written in it.

"Stand there." He pointed to where Djrek was already standing and adopted a look of concentration.

After twenty-five seconds, Sal turned to Djrek. "What's going on?"

"I believe they call it 'ringing the bell'."

"Anchors resonate under warp," the peacock said, nodding while his eyes remained unfocused, "like a tone in your head, unique to each traveller. We use it to request use of the anchor.

"So there's a traveller at the other end?"

The peacock moved his head in a way that somehow rolled his eyes without loosing focus.

"Of course," then mumbled, "but what the hell's taking so long?"

"So someone here has to have bonded to this anchor?"

"Not here," the peacock waved behind him, "in the receiving room. There's no anchor here. And any traveller can hear or ring an anchor if they're close enough. Having a traveller _here_ bound to _this_ anchor would be a waste of— ah," he sighed, "finally."

The peacock raised his hand, palm out. At that moment, something pulled Sal's attention toward the center of the room. It felt like a twisting, and over the next second that twisting sensation increased until he was certain the whole room was about to flip inside out— his stomach was on the verge of doing the same.

The space in the center distorted, then bulged out, twisting the light. It was almost like the field warp Djrek had him produce all those weeks ago, but more defined, directional.

The peacock thrust his hand; the bulge punched out toward the dash, thinning into a needle that disappeared as it stretched, yet Sal had the sense it continued far beyond what he could see. The tapering of the needle compressed on itself, thinning ever more until the needle itself disappeared as it retreated back to the center of the room.

Finally, a blackness— but no, that wasn't right; black suggested absence. Sal peered closely at it. Whatever this was, it _ate_ the light, bending it toward a hole that began to grow in the center of the room. This expanded out, oval-shaped, and into platform until it was just large enough to accommodate a Djrek-sized person. A good third of it had cut into the platform itself.

The edges of absence warped the space around it, seeming to grab both the blueish light and its shadow and twist them around each other. It was an impressive effect and probably the point of the room's design, though somewhat lost on Sal at the moment, who's gut churned with the light.

The whole process had taken three seconds.

"Go! Please." The peacock shooed them toward the light-eating hole in reality.

Djrek walked toward it, then stopped and turned to Sal. "You feel it?"

Sal nodded.

"Good. That shows promise; most people can't. Just... don't throw up on the other side. They hate it when you do that."

Djrek picked up his luggage, leaned forward, and pushed into the portal. When he touched the empty, he disappeared so quickly that Sal wasn't sure he hadn't simply ceased to exist, almost like he'd been sucked in.

Sal took a step forward, raised his hand, and touched the absence. It felt like... nothing: no texture, no friction, just a force that pressed back. But no — Sal leaned forward to look — he wasn't touching the absence. There was a finger's fraction between his hand and it. Was the portal generating the force or was the peacock?

An impatient sound from behind drew his attention. The peacock had wide eyes and pinched lips. He shooed at Sal with his free hand. "Go!"

Ash snickered, standing behind Sal with a barely suppressed smile.

Sal turned back, took a deep breath, clenched his fist, and pressed into the absence. He pushed for only a moment before the force inverted, forcibly pulling him in.

It was only an instant. It wasn't even an instant; it was nothing at all. He was in a stone room, then he was in another room.

Yet his mind _insisted_ he'd been turned inside out, compressed, stretched, torn into a stream of impossibly small particles, then snapped back into shape. It took no time, literally; there was no tick or tock even in his immaculate sense of the moment. Yet he could remember it; he could feel the memory of being torn apart and reconstituted _slowly_, bit by bit, piece by piece, stretched and compressed...

He doubled over; his mouth watered; one ear popped. He stumbled a few steps forward, the whole of his consciousness focused solely on keeping his breakfast in his stomach. A hand pressed on his shoulder but he ignored it. Deep breaths, slow, steady. He kept swallowing but that almost made it worse, so he stopped. His mouth filled with saliva until he considered the merits of drooling— but no, Inquisitors most certainly did not drool. He swallowed, then shuddered as his stomach tried to rebel.

Deep breath; the spinning room began to slow.

Deep breath; the nausea lessened.

Deep breath; the memory of being torn apart began to fade, but only just.

He looked up and was surprised to see Ash leaning over, the same smirk on her face from before.

"It's always rough the first time. They say it gets better." She patted him a couple times, looking very awkward and stiff. "They're idiots."

When he stood up, she stopped and walked over to Djrek, who was conversing with the gate... receiver? Attendant? Yes, attendant, that sounded right.

He took a couple shaky steps but already the feeling was fading. By the time he made it to Djrek, he was almost back to normal though he still felt like the world was tilting. He worked his jaw until his other ear popped, helping to restore balance to the world.

"...I do believe so, yes," the attendant said, "perhaps in an hour or two?"

Djrek nodded, "Excellent." He turned to Ash. "We'll head straight to the docks."

Ash shrugged. "Works for me. I hate this place." She also wavered on her feet a little.

Djrek turned to Sal, who was still working his jaw and tongue. "Despite what your mind is telling you, you were not actually just torn apart and rebuilt from scratch."

"Probably," Ash said.

Djrek shot her an annoyed look. "Ignore her; she's always hated gates. The stronger your gravics are, the more of an effect a gate will have on you. It has less to do with the actual process of travelling than it does with the fields necessary to make it happen. They mess with your internal senses, disrupting the flows within your body. Your mind, unable to make sense of it, constructs the only rational story it can—"

"I was just torn apart and put back together, piece by piece."

"Hmm," Djrek nodded, "but it helps to understand that's not what happened."

"I guess..." He was pretty certain that's exactly what happened.

Ash laughed. "That's the spirit!"

"Enough," Djrek waved her off, "we need to leave now if we want to catch the captain before he heads into the city."

"You'll get no argument from me." Ash said, already heading for the door.

Djrek grunted and gave one last nod to the attendant, but the man wasn't looking, instead staring at exactly nothing in the center of the room. Djrek walked after Ash without another glance at Sal.

Sal took another breath, feeling the last of the nausea fade. It had only been three minutes and... actually, he didn't know. Those first few seconds out of the gate had been disorienting, but at least he hadn't thrown up.

He spared a glance at the attendant, who was probably listening for the bell, and jogged to catch up with Djrek.

At first, he thought they were in another stone building but realized the 'stone' here had layers, striations of different shades of grey and cream. Within it were pieces of what looked like shells, though it was hard to tell underneath the polish.

It took twenty three seconds to walk down the hallway and into a large foyer. Another thirty four seconds were spent as Djrek picked two porters out of a group of well-dressed young men, and paid them to take their bags and run off. Eleven seconds were spent walking out of the foyer and into the top of a city...

That was unexpected.

He'd expected to come out amongst the buildings, not on top of them. Instead Sal stood looking down into the city from a great height. A chilled wind whipped at him, causing him to shiver.

It was a city unlike any he'd imagined. Andriel was built on shelves, or half-plates of varying sizes that that both stuck out of and made up a steep, inclined cliff. They staggered down to the water, and probably continued well into the sea itself. The city was built on these plates, hundreds of them, with some seeming to contain whole compounds while others just loosely grouped buildings.

The buildings themselves were almost all trapezoidal, with tapered sides and flat-topped roofs. They seemed to be constructed mostly of the same striated substance the gate building was made of. In many cases the striations were clearly decorative, especially on buildings in the upper plates, which were lighter with more of the cream and less of the gray. Plates on a similar level were often connected by bridges and for the others, stairs cut into them to lead down to the ones below.

Andriel was clearly a bay, though a large one. While the city took up much of the view, Sal could see far more unused plates continue on into a horizon obscured by haze and bending inward toward the sea. The air carried on it salt but, oddly enough, not much else; Sal had expected a port city to smell like fish for some reason. Andriel didn't, though perhaps they were too high to smell it.

They were not too high to hear it. The curve of the bay combined with the staggered cliffs and plates, all combined to amplify and blur the sound of thousands of human voices into a dull roar.

Djrek and Ash didn't spare a glance, but continued straight down the steps of a comparatively small plate dominated entirely by the gate... building? He wasn't sure of the name, but it looked oddly like a temple, especially with the tapered walls. Gate temple? Sure, that worked. The gate temple was set partially into a cliff face and—

Wait — Sal stared back at the building — Andriel was northest of Hontima and, looking at the sun, that meant... did they travel _though_ stone?

No.

No no, not a good thought. Sal shuddered at the memory of being torn apart; the idea that all those bits of him travelling through solid rock... nope. He turned his back to the temple and, once again, hurried to catch up to Djrek, intent on keeping his thoughts far away from the idea of travel.

The temple steps, fifty two of them, led down to a walkway carved into the cliff, wide enough for four people to walk side by side. From there they went right, and followed southward it until they reach a much larger plate, the center of which was a large road that meandered though the center of the city and down to the bottom plates, which Sal imagined to be the docks.

It was here that press of humanity pressed at Sal. This thorough way seemed to be the only way out of the city, and it was packed with a chaotic mess of drajin, sleds, and people all trying to make their way without any order whatsoever. He even spotted a few guarded palanquins slowly making their way, physically pushing others aside. A constant stream shouts and curses punctuated the din, giving the sense that the place was moments away from erupting into violence.

As usual, the crowd parted around the Inquisitors, but only at the last possible moment, and often with surprised and fearful yelps as people jumped out of the way of the pair. The bubble around them closed almost immediately, giving Sal barely a pace of room to keep up in. He stuck as close as he dared, but still had to contend with press, weaving and rushing as people cut him off or, in some cases, practically walked over him like he wasn't there. Now more than ever did he wish for Roland's height.

Along with the clash of noise came a clash of color arranged with so many different styles of clothing that they pulled at Sal's eyes. The predominant color was a grey that suspiciously matched the general color of the lower buildings and these were almost certainly the locals. Their style was reminiscent of what might be worn in his home town: trousers, shirts, and boots. Except the shirts were mostly tucked in and often left with top-half unbuttoned, at least for the men. And the trousers were loose and flowed, flaring out toward the ankles. While most wore a sturdy, rough cotton, there were finer specimens for the richer folk with similar, if a bit more ornate designs that tended to center around the shirt's open lapels with... lace. Even the men seemed to wear lace.

So maybe they weren't like his home town after all.

Aside from these, he spotted quite a few people dressed in the wraps common to Santonia, and even a few wearing the more traditional Sari. Fewer still were dark skinned folk who seemed to prefer bright colored ponchos that contrasted sharply with their skin. One of them had geometric patterns on it. Another group, with paler skin and angular eyes, wore something more akin to a military uniform coupled with a bright red sash. They walked in a loose formation, giving credence to the military theme; that and the crowd seemed to part around them almost as well as the Inquisitors who...

...who were _gone_.

Sal stopped abruptly, frantically searching for the pair. They should be easy to spot, yet no matter how he searched he couldn't find a glimpse of their raven cloth.

Someone barrelled into him, pushing him into a lady walking the other direction. A scent of must and flowers washed over him. The man who'd bowled him over hadn't even slowed.

"You lost little one?" the woman said with words that slurred strangely.

He let go of her pants and looked up, wide eyed, with his thoughts mostly still trying to figure out how he'd lost them. Had he truly been so distracted by clothing of all things?

She reached down but he stepped aside before she could grab him. He darted back into the crowd, ignoring her shouts at his back. He rushed forward, half bouncing off people, pushing himself forward. Shouts and curses followed, spurring him on until he reached the stairs leading down to the next plate down. He tried to peer down the stairs, but people kept getting in the way.

He diverted around the stairs, following along the edge until it became a proper balcony overlooking the traffic below. He continued past store fronts hawking goods, and up to an area with a low decorative fence and gate. He stopped where the fence met the balcony rail and jumped up onto the rail, leaning out over the stairs.

In the center of the stairs was a ramp, just wide enough for two sleds. Drajin pulled the sleds, their handlers on the stairs leading them and, strangely, not in the sled's driver's bench. From this vantage, what had seemed like utter chaos resolved into patterns. The drajin took the center, moving slowly up and down the ramps in a single file each. People reserved the stairs for themselves, but the outside edges moved quicker. Moreover, the right side was moving down, the left up. It was obvious now why Sal had so much trouble; he'd been pushing against the fastest moving part of the crowd moving in the opposite direction.

Nowhere below could he see the telltale Inquisitor black.

He huffed in frustration and glanced over at a man guarding the small gate. He was talking to a couple but the gate was open. Sal rushed over, around the couple, and through the gate as quickly as he could. He ignored the shout of protest and wove through tables, most occupied by well dressed patrons eating food that, frankly, smelled wonderful. His stomach growled in agreement. It shouldn't be lunchtime but then, perhaps it was here. The sun didn't quite align with the time he thought it should be.

The seating area narrowed to a point where the cutaway from the stairs met the actual plate edge. Sal rushed to the railing and, once gain, leaned out.

The traffic pattern changed at the bottom of the stairs. While the drajin mostly continued on through the center, the people rushed to fill in the extra space in a chaotic mess at the stair's end. Further from the stairs, the traffic slowed around the edges, which contained more shops, leaving two bands on either side of the middle as the faster portions. Sal memorized the pattern. He would need it; he still could find no sign of Djrek and Ash.

It made no sense. They weren't walking that fast. Hell, even if they'd been running, he still should see them from this vantage. So what, they went down a side street? That made no sense; he was certain this street led straight to the docks— he'd seen it from the gate temple. There was no reason for them to disappear. No reason, none... unless...

His mouth dried up as a single word grew solid in his mind: bait.

A hand grabbed his shoulder, causing him to freeze up in terror. Flashes of his father tore through his mind but as he was roughly pulled off the railing, instinct born of months of training took over.

He let go and dropped off the railing, slipping out of the grip which hadn't expected the sudden reversal. As soon as his feet hit the ground, he jumped back up and shoved the tip of his knife between the ribs, angled up toward the heart.

He stopped halfway, his blade barely a finger from the man's heart.

It wasn't his father; it wasn't an assassin; it was just the stupid gate guard.

Sal retracted his knife as the man flinched back and grabbed at his chest. The gate guard stumbled back, tripped, and landed on the edge of a table, flipping it and sending half the food flying out over the balcony railing. Two of the diners around the table had stood in shock. The third, who couldn't have been more than four years old, was clapping in delight.

Sal sheathed his knife while all the attention was still on the gate guard. Nobody had seen him yet, not really; he was just a kid standing around. He slipped away, weaving through the tables, beneath their gaze, paced quickly but not so fast as to draw attention.

It took only seven seconds for the first shouts to reach his ears. He'd almost reached the gate.

Another two seconds while people looked around, confused. Diners rose from their seats, furthering the confusion. Eyes began to search for him as he passed through the gate.

He continued on for another eight seconds, then risked a glance back over his shoulder. The gate guard was stumbling through the tables, gasping words that didn't make sense. But he was pointing toward Sal and blood was leaking through his fingers. Several diners caught on and more shouts were thrown at him.

Sal bolted.

It took twelve seconds to reach the stairs. Three men had taken up the call and rushed after him.

He angled into the crowd and wove through them, careful not to bump anyone lest their outrage give him away. He ducked behind a sled going up, then leapt over the hitch of another going down, using the drajin pulling it to hide him. He continued on into the fast-lane, jogging down the steps as quickly as he could, weaving around people now going in the same direction, careful to keep his head low.

Never in his life had he ever been so grateful of his short height. He was practically invisible in the crowd.

More shouts but they were distant now. He'd lost them. He slowed, now matching the pace of the crowd until he reach the bottom of the stairs. Remembering the pattern, he angled inward through the chaos until he was back in the fast lane.

He'd almost killed a man. Perhaps he had; he wasn't sure. He was sure he hadn't reached the heart... or, well, he was mostly sure. Clearly, he'd gotten the lungs, but a man could survive that, right? Depended on how quickly he got attention.

Yet that wasn't what bothered him. The man would live, or he wouldn't. What bothered Sal was how _easy_ it was. Nobody had seen Sal stab him, and the only reason he was suspect was because the man himself had pointed him out. But had Sal thrust the blade fully in, he could have walked out of that diner without anyone realizing what he'd done while the dying man occupied everyone's attention.

In his mind, assassination was a big deal and assassins were dramatic people that did dramatic acts. He expected a fight with someone clothed in black, wrapped in mist or something. He expected to see them, catch them in the act and then... probably die but at the very least, he would look them in the eyes, he would know what happened.

But that was ridiculous, wasn't it? The gate guard had no idea. The confusion on his face mimicked Youlson's, which mimicked the first man he killed, whatever his name was. They just didn't see it coming; even when Sal was holding a knife to their throat, they didn't see it coming.

Would he?

The assassin would look like a normal, every day person. He would bump and thrust, then keep walking as normal. No one would notice; Sal may not even notice at first, depending on the blade, thinking someone accidentally poked him. Then he would collapse, confused, as his life bled out, never seeing the person who killed him, a person that looked just like everyone else.

Just like everyone else...

Sal abruptly angled his direction outward, weaving through the crowd, careful not to bump anyone, though now for a different reason. He didn't care if they made a scene, he just didn't want to be stabbed by some random yet very normal looking stranger. Twice he almost pulled his knife when a random person — _not_ an assassin — bumped him purely by accident. Neither one had any idea how close they'd come to dying; both times he'd have been dead before he knew it.

The shops along the edge had half their wares in the street, which seemed like a poor idea. The owners, he noticed, tended to linger in the doorway, keeping one eye on the shop, the other on their exposed wares.

Sal slowed just below the pace of everyone else, though it made his back itch.

The first shop sold pottery: mugs, vases, plates, bowls, and absolutely nothing useful to him. The second shop sold odd little wooden figurines of fish in odd poses; Sal couldn't imagine they were useful to anyone whatsoever. The third sold hats; that was better but not what he needed. The fourth was closed— oh, no it wasn't. Huh, so that's why they had their wares out in the street. That one sold boots, and Sal was sorely tempted but the risk was too great.

It was the fourth that grabbed his attention and the proprietor, a thin well-dressed man, was talking to a customer in the store. Perfect. Racks had been lined up to display clothes in the local fashion, though fancier than he preferred at the moment. Once he was between the racks, his short height made him impossible to see.

The pants were lined up by size; he grabbed the smallest pair he could find. The shirts also, so he grabbed the smallest one and paused, thinking he'd accidentally grabbed a woman's blouse. But no, the rich men here wore lace; he'd seen that. Sal tucked the shirt under his arm.

He almost left but paused when he saw the next rack over: coats. His own clothes were already too thin for the weather. Deep into autumn, Andriel wasn't quite as cold as Sal would have expected, especially for as far north as it was, but there was a constant breeze and having a single open shirt was not appealing.

He sidled over, risking exposure as he rounded one rack into and an isle that butted up against the wall, only one way in and out, easily seen, but only at the entrance to the isle. He paused and reaffirmed he was still hidden from the owner. Problem was, the coats were definitely not, and should the owner look over at the wrong time...

Sal glanced around the rack; the customer was arguing over some shirt with far too much embroidery on it.

Slowly, carefully, he removed the smallest coat, then risked adjusting the other coats to hide the gap. He stopped and listened; they were still arguing. Good.

He slipped back around the rack, walked down the isle, and merged into the crowd, his new clothes tucked firmly under the arm opposite of the owner, just in case the man happened to look.

Changing would be tricky but he dipped into a nice dark alley to hide in the shadows. He immediately began to strip, first removing his trousers and replacing them with the new ones that he now noticed had a cream color embroidery along the outside pant leg, contrasting with a two-tone grey woven fabric. They were too long, of course, but a couple folds fixed that.

The shirt was soft and lacy, but at least it almost fit him. A little long in the arms but otherwise manageable, especially with the coat, which did fit and allowed him to bunch up the shirt within the coat sleeves. The coat also hid his knife, which would have been otherwise difficult in this particular ensemble but it too had no way to fully close up the chest— did they walk around bare-chested in the winter?

His boots were worn and didn't work with the outfit, but most people wouldn't be looking at his boots. Whatever; it was basically a costume. It still annoyed him though.

"Them was a good lift, I'd say," a voice said from the shadows, though it sounded like it was spoken by someone with cotton in their mouth. "Supposin it just bad timin for you."

Sal spun and turned toward the voice, which had come from deeper within the alley. Three shapes walked out of the shadows, resolving into boys a bit older than Sal. They were lean and dirty with clothes of lessor quality than what he'd just discarded. Two of them held thick wooden sticks, while the leader had some kind of metal wrapped between his fingers.

Sal stared at them for four seconds. They had a hard aggressive look he instantly recognized. He slowly shook his head, returning his attention to his coat.

"There were these boys in my home town that always tried to beat me up," he said as he buttoned up his coat. "They kept thinking that because I was different and they were bigger, it gave them the right." He paused after he buttoned up the last button, which was only halfway up the coat. "Had a friend who kept getting into fights with them, trying to defend me. He never seemed to realize I never needed him to." He tugged on his coat sleeves to straighten them, rolled his shoulder to settle it, then turned and gave the three his best imitation of Djrek's polite smile. "Of course, it doesn't matter anymore, does it?"

The leader spared a glance at the one on his left, then turned a confused look to Sal. "Whais that?"

Sal shrugged, then folded his arms behind him. "They're all dead."

"Riiiight. Well, ya'aint from around here, so I'll play it nice en easy. You keep em rags you jus threw in de dirt, but them threads you wearin are mine."

Sal glanced down at his old clothes. "Sure, you can have those; I don't need them anymore."

The leader laughed, "You gotta pair!" He cupped his hand and moved it in a suggestive circle. "A give you da, but da ain whaddi sai."

Sal cocked his head. "I'm sorry, what was that?"

The boy scowled and again looked at the one on his left. "Hard waitis."

Sal had never seen anyone telegraph their punch so thoroughly as that boy did then. It was comical. He actually twisted his foot first, then rotated his hips, then his chest, all in sequence. If he had punched straight, he might have managed a decent amount of power, assuming he hit anything. But he didn't. Instead, he threw a wild hook that wasted the straight-line force he'd oh-so-slowly set up for himself.

Sal took a single step in and, while the boy's hand flew behind his head, thrust the knife into his jugular. He immediately pushed the boy off and stepped back at an angle to keep the spray of blood from ruining his new cloths.

He looked at the other two, who had grown pale with shock while their friend thrashed and gurgled on the ground. He replaced his polite smile.

"My offer still stands; you can have those if you want them." He gestured to his old clothes.

The pair fled.

Sal turned his gaze to the leader, who's spasms had settled into twitches. After thirteen seconds, the boy stopped moving. He waited for exactly thirty seconds.

Nothing.

Did his father beat it out of him, or was he just born this way? Was his father this way? He wasn't sure. The man drank, slept, and beat him; but Sal didn't know what he'd been like before any more than he knew the face of his mother. Perhaps this was why he drank in the first place.

Djrek called Sal capable; he was certain most would call him a monster. But he didn't care. Who he was allowed him to find his purpose. Those who had truly carried his affection, those who could have been his conscious, they had all died.

He could suddenly see a future where he had no purpose, one where he was unchained by... anything at all. He could see a future where his only purpose was to gather power by any means, and not because he loved power so much, but because there was simply nothing else to do.

He _needed_ purpose. Unbound by it, he would be a monster in truth; he would be his father; he would be worse. But he wasn't. He had Djrek and Djrek had given him purpose.

He knelt down and wiped his blade on the boy's shirt. He smiled, and this time it was genuine.

But the blood would not come off the blade. He frowned, momentarily confused until he realized he'd sheathed his knife without cleaning off the gate guard's blood.

Stupid. He wasn't even sure how to clean the knife, much less the sheath. He could scrape it off with his fingernails but that would leave blood under them.

He looked around and noticed the blood had pooled and soaked into his old clothes. He bunched them up, careful to keep the blood off his hands, then wiped the blade repeatedly until the boy's blood had softened the gate guard's enough to wipe it off.

He smiled at the now clean blade, and then at boy. "Thank you," he said, and he meant it.

Sal stood up, re-sheathed his knife, and walked out. It was time to find Djrek. He had a purpose to fulfill.
