# 37 | Training [Roland]

Roland opened the door and winced from the screech of its hinges. Beyond was a large, flat-stone courtyard semi-enclosed by a pair of three-story buildings that occupied the diagonal corners of the courtyard, angled toward the house. A scattering of debris blown in from last night's storm littered the court, but it was the other buildings that drew his attention.

At three stories, they dominated the courtyard, making the two-story mansion behind him feel almost quaint. Almost. If he'd had any doubt this Rose lady was rich (he hadn't), it gathered the remains of its dignity and walked out right the door. Not only was there much more to the house behind him than he'd seen, but these behemoths before him looked less like homes and more like they served specific purposes.

On his right, tall narrow windows stretched from floor to roof. Two of them bracketed a nondescript pair of double doors he thought were taller than typical. The other building was more normal, with three rows of windows and two doors set near the ends.

Both buildings looked dead. They stood still, silent, and cold, with not even a candle to breath life. They instilled a sense of isolation, somehow emphasizing an emptiness made more profound by abandonment, than if they'd never existed at all.

He walked over to the one with tall windows and peered in through the glass. A black nothing greeted him at first. As his pupils stretched, he caught long edges barely glinting off a pre-dawn light. Shelves, and they stretched up into the black at least two stories.

He took a couple steps back and stared up at the windows, perplexed and more than a little ill at ease. The shelves had been empty.

He walked over to the other building. Behind each window was an empty room, though in one case he thought two of the windows revealed the same, large room. Whatever they'd been used for, they were empty now. Both doors were locked.

He took a step back, swallowed hard, and decided that perhaps it was a good thing. A building like that just might reach out and swallow a boy. He backed away slowly lest any quick movement reveal him as prey. Yes, it was absurd and childish, and he knew that. He moved slow anyway.

He saw no other buildings, no neighbors, and no light that might suggest they exist. But rich people didn't like to live near each other, right? They lived on a lot of land with enough space they needn't be bothered by the likes of humanity. But in all his imaginings of rich people, which admittedly didn't cross his mind often, he never imagined them sequestered away in the middle of the forest.

At least it was a forest he knew. Pine, maple, and birch mostly, but further back he saw the bleached colors of Whitewood branches peaking through, giving even the birch a dirtied countenance. Just beyond the trees between the tall-windowed building and the mansion he could barely see distant snow capped granite.

He didn't recognize the mountains. They were like his, but different and much closer. At home, the jagged landscape had remained hidden except from the tallest hills; but here it loomed, just visible through the trees if he tilted his head right.

A deep unease crept in as he stared at the snow caps. The mountains were too close. Something about that flared his unease, bringing it dangerously close to real fear.

His stomach rumbled. He looked down and poked at it.

"Didn't I just feed you?"

It gurgled a token reply, then settled. He frowned in discontent but what was he supposed to do? He'd just eaten, and he knew of no adult that would give food so soon after a meal, as though hunger were some timed thing that came around in scheduled waves.

He shifted from foot to foot and wrapped his arms around himself. The dew should have burned off by now, and it was colder than it should be. He glanced toward the mountains, then glared at them; they'd cut off the morning sun and denied him its warmth. It suddenly seemed very important.

Rose told him to come out and wait here.

How absurd.

He shifted a little more. How long had it been? It felt like forever; his stomach certainly thought so. Surely it'd been long enough for him to have satisfied her order.

He took a deep breath and held it, then turned slowly to take everything in. She never actually said how long.

The courtyard was bracketed by benches placed sporadically around the edges of the courtyard, under the windows or, in the case of the tall ones, in front of them. But not by the house, which instead held a row of varied cabinets and chests lined up under an extended overhang.

They didn't appear locked, which initially felt odd but then — he glanced toward the mountains — perhaps it didn't matter. Who knew what strange people lived here. What strange, clearly rich people. Or person? He was beginning to suspect it was only Rose and him here. That did not comfort him.

The courtyard occupied what should be the front of the house. That's how they worked, wasn't it? But it didn't really look like a front. Maybe there was a front. A front would face the road. He really, really wanted there to be a road, street... hard-packed dirt? Anything that would indicate they weren't actually alone out here.

He peered around the corner to see a long wall broken only by a couple windows. Long, tall grass ran right up to the foundation. Clearly the side of the house. He eyed the forest only a few dozen paces away, which was still far darker than any forest had a right to be, and decided to make a run for it.

He arrived at the next corner breathless, gave himself a few seconds to calm down, then peeked around the corner and at an empty, open-sided porch. A path led out, but as far as he could see it went nowhere.

He walked to it, and stared.

The path itself was mostly just flattened grass, but it ended at a perfect line of scarred dirt, like something had cut into the ground repeatedly until nothing refused to grow.

Roland stared at the line, then the forest beyond, then back at the line. There was nothing about this that made sense.

He shook off the thought, filed it away for later, and walked back to the courtyard, his mind oblivious to the dangerous black shadows he'd run from just moments before. He continued through the courtyard to the opposite side of the house, fully expecting there to be another long run of empty wall. Instead, several workbenches lined the back along with another couple of cabinets. An ill-worn path led into the forest. Nothing else could be seen.

The forest was quiet this early, allowing Roland to hear what might have been the distant tinkle of a stream and nothing else. Probably where the path led, but— he turned back to the house and squinted at it. Rose lived in a fully furnished home in the mountains, with two abandoned buildings, and yet somehow had running water and absurdly expensive gravtech. The were no real paths that led to the house, and no one around that he could see.

He glanced back at the abandoned, boy eating death constructs behind him. Maybe she ran out of money?

He walked back to the courtyard, over to one chest, and unlatched it and— yep, it had no lock. Inside were what looked like children's toys. He rummaged through them and pulled a few out to look at them, dropping them when done. Most were closer to puzzles than toys. He messed around with one that had a series of interlocking rings, but couldn't figure out what the goal was. It kind of looked like a puzzle, but there was nothing here to solve. He shrugged, dropped it, and moved to a cabinet that stood taller taller than him.

Again, no lock; that really bothered him. The only reason she wouldn't have locks were if there really was no one around.

He opened the cabinet.

"Oh..."

His eyes went wide; his mouth dropped. Inside were weapons, a lot of them. Well, not exactly weapons; these were all made of wood, but they represented a range of weapons types— okay, perhaps not types; it was mostly just swords, but there was a whole lot of different sizes and shapes of swords.

Suddenly, he saw the courtyard for what it was, a training ground. The flat-packed stone carried in it the pressure of a thousand feet practicing for thousands of hours, honing skill to mastery. He saw himself learn and grow to become the blade master he'd always dreamed of.

He was going to become a champion.

He reached in, grabbed the largest specimen he could see, one almost his height, and yanked it from the cabinet. The tip of the sword dragged to the ground. He stared at it in surprise.

His lips pinched and his eyes narrowed. He grunted and pulled and managed to raise the tip about a pace before he stalled, then slowly, gravity returned the tip to the ground. Determination shifted to exasperation; what was this thing made of?

He let got the hilt — that one wouldn't work — and grabbed the next size down. This one he could at least raise up, though his arms were shaking after a few seconds. He dropped that one too, scowled at the cabinet, and then sighed as he grabbed one of the smaller ones.

This one worked.

"Yarrr!"

He thrust the point forward and stabbed, then stabbed again. It was still heavy though. He swiped it back and forth, then let it drop to his side when his shoulders started to burn. Were swords really this heavy?

The door opened with a screech, causing him to jump. Rose walked out wearing the black trousers and red shirt he'd seen her in earlier that morning. They looked too expensive to train in, but he wasn't going to question whatever weird things rich people did, especially when they clearly lived by themselves in the middle of the forest, and made a habit of kidnapping kids. You know what? If she wanted to ruin a perfectly good shirt, that was none of his business.

Rose stopped short when she saw him; her eyes widened.

"What part of 'wait' did you not understand?"

"I waited," Roland glanced around at the swords and puzzles lying scattered on the ground, "mostly."

"Put. them. back."

He shrugged. "Sure..."

He put the short sword back, then managed the mid-sized one without too much trouble. The large one, though, was a problem. He tried to pick it up by the hilt but he'd couldn't even manage a few fingers off the ground. He then tried the middle, which was easier, but he still dragged the hilt. He was about half-way to getting back on the rack when a slender hand appeared and took it from him.

Roland gaped at her as she casually flipped the weapon around to grab the hilt. This lady was way stronger than she looked. She pointed toward the puzzles as she replaced the weapon with one hand.

Roland walked over to the chest and began tossing the puzzles back into the chest.

"Put them back just like you found them," she said from behind.

He glanced at one of the puzzles in his hand, then pointed at the chest. "They came from there..."

"_Just_ like you found them."

He huffed, then added an exaggerated sigh for effect. When it was clear his ministrations had no effect, he finally considered the chest. Now that he looked, the chest did look to have some kind of organization to it, but he had no idea where to put each puzzle. He carefully lowered the last puzzle into a random place in the chest. Her hand appeared on the lid. Uh oh—

He snatched his fingers back as the lid slammed shut.

"Hey!"

"You will not open anything unless I tell you to."

"Uh... sure," he lied. _Anything?_ . That was just ridiculous.

She stared at him, probably with the intent of giving him some kind of evil glare or another, but he had a lot of practice ignoring those and he refused to look at her.

After a moment, she walked over to one of the cabinets — not the one he'd opened — and pulled out two long wooden swords, though one a bit shorter than the other. The sight of the practice swords sent flutters through his stomach.

"The rules are simple," Rose said. "You will do what I say, when I say, as I say it. You may ask questions relevant to the task and nothing more."

"Uh huh." _Champion. He was going to be a champion._

"Good, let's begin."

"What's with the line of dirt out front?" It was really bothering him.

Her eyes flattened. "Repeat what I just said."

"Let's begin?"

"No, before that."

"Umm... do what you say?"

She almost looked like she was going to say something, then probably realized how futile it would be. That was good; at least she could be trained.

She tossed one of the swords at him, startling him. It bounced off his chest and fell to the ground.

"Owww." That was way harder than it needed to be.

She gave him a flat look and gestured at the stick. He bent over and picked up it. As he did, she walked to the center of the clearing.

"This may not look like much, but it's what we'll start with."

She moved her weapon through a few fluid motions, somehow making it possess a grace it shouldn't have. Her movements flowed from one to another without the slightest falter or break. It was possibly the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

A wide grin broke his face. He swiped his sword back and forth in a kind of mimicry that may or may not have contained the same level of grace she had just displayed.

She shifted into a position that he hoped was some kind of stance, though her sword rested at her side. He tried to mimic her position as his heart began to race.

"Now, attack me."

He stared at her. He wasn't sure what he expected but attacking her wasn't it. Maybe some tips on position, sequences to try, pointers on his hold, or even a 'defend thyself' as she mock attacked, but attacking someone like her with a stick was far outside anything ever considered acceptable. Of course, he mostly ignored acceptable things, but there were just some lines you didn't cross.

She lowered her weapon once it was clear he wouldn't budge.

"To practice, we must spar. If you do not attack me, I will attack you, and I can assure you one will be more painful than the other."

Roland took a step back.

Her eyes narrowed as she released breath through her nose. She worked her jaw for a minute, then gave him a serious look.

"If you do not train, you will not eat."

Roland's back straightened immediately. As any boy does, he liked food a lot, and Rose's food was exceptional. He licked his lips absently. With his stomach already grumbling at him, he decided to go all out. She wanted a warrior, he would _be_ a warrior.

With the best war cry he could manage, he raised his weapon over his head and ran at her. With the exception of a raised eyebrow, she didn't move a muscle. At just the perfect time, he leaped in the air, renewed his yell, and brought down on her the full force of his swing.

In a smooth motion, she brought her weapon up and struck his fingers, which immediately released his stick to fly through the air. She spun and followed this with a small step to the side and circled her weapon around in a smooth motion to hit his shins hard. He flew through the air stickless, his feet up almost over his head, while the ground rapidly approached his face. His war cry changed to more of a strangled war yelp, cut off by the sound of a face plant.

She gave him an astonished look as he turned over with a groan. "Why did you... never mind. Okay, your _first_ lesson is to be silent. Do not scream at your opponent; do not announce what you're going to do. Now, get up and try again."

"But it was a war cry."

She blinked. "Do not _cry_ at your opponent."

"But that's not..." His words trailed off into a sigh. Honestly, he'd walked right into that. He got up slowly as pain warred with embarrassment. He backed up a couple steps.

Rose released a hiss through her teeth. "Last time. Attack now or I will attack you. One will hurt more than the other."

That was not why he was backing up. She clearly missed the point, but that was fine; she'd figure it out. He backed up a few more steps. Just as she seemed on the verge of saying something else, he launched himself at her with little more than a grunt of effort.

He could not understand what happened next. His stick had gone flying, again, but she hadn't rapped his knuckles like last time. No, it was his palm that hurt. His _palm_. It made no sense, but somehow she'd manage to get the tip of her sword into his grip and flicked the weapon away from him.

The rest involved his feet flying up over his head and on to hit the ground before the rest of him. She'd sent his war jump into a full-on war flip.

He moaned and grabbed his shins as he rolled around on the ground.

"Do not jump at your opponent. As soon as your feet leave the ground, you're opponent knows exactly where you're going to be and how to defeat you."

He nodded absently as he rubbed his shins. Gods but that hurt. He resolved himself then that if he were to ever get in another fight, he would attack their shins. It was positively debilitating pain.

"Up. Now. Again."

He got up, motivated under the distinct impression that his shins were exposed and she would have no issue putting pain to use.

He took one cautious step and followed it with another, approaching her like he would a viper. It had become clear he had no idea what he was doing. This was nothing like how he thought training to be a champion would be. He decided to play it safe, minimize the pain.

He stabbed her.

Light burst in his eyes, and he staggered. When he opened them, he was on the ground, though he could hardly recall how it happened.

"Do not close your eyes when you attack. That's... just don't."

He got up slowly and stumbled as the world tilted. He turned to her, somewhat ready, though everything felt surreal. A dull, throbbing pain had started to radiate from the side of his head. He reached up to touch it, felt wet, and brought back red. He blinked at the blood for a moment and turned his hand to show her.

"Your weapon. Now, again."

He looked back down at his hand in a daze. No, it was definitely blood. He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and processed her words.

Weapon. She'd told him to get it.

He looked and found his stick a few paces away. The world, at least, had stopped tilting, and he managed to pick up the piece of wood without falling over.

He approached her cautiously and tried hard to think of how to do it better, but his mind felt gummy and stabbing things at least kept something between them. That seemed really important for some reason.

He stabbed her but this time kept his eyes open, for what little good it did.

In a single move, she batted his attack away, sidestepped forward, and whipped her own weapon across his back. He grunted as he staggered forward from the attack. Pain lanced across his back and brought tears to his eyes.

"Better, but you over-extended your attack, allowing me to move in beyond your guard. Now, again."

He glared at her. "What does that even mean?"

"Again."

"Not that, I know what 'again' means."

Her face flattened.

He took a step back as much to gain some distance as to frame the question.

"I though you would answer questions about training?"

She cocked her head to the side and dropped her weapon to her side. "What question?"

He pulled one out through the hazy ache of his mind. "What does 'over-extend' mean?"

She paused. "It means to move in such a way that you become off balance and unable to deflect further attacks."

He frowned and worked through her words. "So... I tried to hit too hard?"

Surprise flickered across her face before she nodded. "Yes. Now, again."

"What does 'guard' mean?"

She took a step back and then pressed her fingers into her temple. "It means that space in which you can deflect attacks." She dropped her hand, eyes hard. "Now. Again."

"So... I tried to hit so hard that I couldn't stop attacks?"

"_Yes._ Now. Again."

"Why didn't you just say that for the first time?"

Her turned dangerous and while her eyes were already hard, something in them told him that he had no further room to push.

With no other option, he approached carefully, again. He stabbed at her a third time and tried not to over-extend. This time she didn't even bother moving, but simply batted the weapon out of his hand and followed it with a hard blow to his stomach. He doubled over and wheezed as he tried to catch his breath.

"Keep a tighter grip on your weapon, or you'll lose it. Lose your weapon, and you die. Now, again."

Stabbing didn't work, but perhaps if he swung at her. He approached her again, still with his stick between them. He just felt too exposed without it firmly in front. Once in range, he pulled his arm back to strike and then doubled over when she stabbed in the stomach at the same place as before. He hadn't even started his swing.

"Pulling your arm back like that will only advertise your intentions and leave you vulnerable. Now, again."

How was he supposed to attack without swinging? Why wasn't she telling him what to do? He tried to think of something else to try, but swing and stab were all he really knew. Maybe he should swing in a different direction?

He approached and tried an upswing she easily avoided, and then followed with her own. She struck him under the back of his arm, the sensitive part, and caused his weapon to go flying... again. He watched it go, and that sense of the surreal assaulted him. His only thought as he walked over to pick it back up was that he needed to wake up, and soon.

"...now, again!"

He looked back at her. What did she say? Frustration flash-boiled into anger. He couldn't touch her. He tried to swing again, but it only resulted in a welt across his arms that caused him to drop his weapon again— no, not a weapon, just a stupid stick.

"... again!"

This was not how it was supposed to be. He wasn't a hero. He was just a stupid boy. If this is what being a champion meant, he didn't want it. He stepped back and looked down at the ground. He knew she would be angry, but so was he. This wasn't training, it was a beating. It didn't matter if he had a stick, sword, or lance. Nothing he did would protect him from her. So why try?

"Again."

His jaw clenched. She waited a moment, but his posture was clear and defiant.

She shook her head once and spoke in a quiet voice. "I warned you."

She moved quicker than he thought possible and rapped his knuckles so hard two of them split as his stick flew away. Using the hilt of her weapon, she punched him in the chest and caused him to double over with a wheeze. She followed this with a quick strike to his nose and finished with one to his temple. He rolled over on the ground and gasped for air as his nose swelled up and leaked blood.

She waited a minute for him to recover. "Now, again."

He reached up and wiped at the blood he felt trickle down his lip. She had told the truth: attacking her was the least painful option. And yet it was hard to attack, like intentionally sticking your hand into a vipers face.

He gritted his teeth and rolled over onto his knees. Viper or not, there simply wasn't a choice. She'd beat him if he didn't try.

He made it to his feet but wavered slightly, his vision blurred. He looked around until he found his stick and walked over to pick it up, slow enough to give him time, not so slow as to earn another beating. He gripped the stick with white knuckles and turned to face her. Her face was neither taunting nor encouraging, only a dispassionate calm that required obedience.

He tried an underhand attack that felt awkward to him but at least forced her to move. His efforts yielded a welt on the back of his neck that stung more than he thought it should.

"...again!"

He attacked again with vicious force, and yet again he received another blow for his effort. Rose started to speak, but he wasn't done and swung back around at her face in a clumsy attempt to catch her off guard. She leaned back just enough that he missed by a hair's breadth, and then poked him hard in his now-exposed ribcage.

"Better. Unpredictability is one of the first tenants of battle."

As it to make her point, she lunged at him. Somehow he managed to dodge it, but she'd already shifted her grip on the weapon and angled her attack so the hilt of it contacted his mouth.

He clung to fairness as an ideal, a thing he could float upon above the deadly waters. Yet his raft had holes. Nothing he tried worked. She moved quicker than he could see, and with a grace that he struggled to accept as real. Every attempt resulted in pain along with some inane advice that would do him absolutely no good because he wasn't good enough.

He aimed at her face and received a blow across his head that made his ears ring and more blood streamed down his face.

Anger flashed into rage, but his fury turned as cold and clear as the morning had become. He consumed it, and without thought, he _pushed_.

A wave of distortion exploded out from him, sending the storms debris flying along an edge of compressed light. Everything near him took flight, everything except Rose. She hadn't moved; not even her hair had been disturbed. The wave of destruction had simply parted around her.

An invisible wall slammed him back.

He landed hard and rolled to a stop at the edge of the training ground, far from where he'd once stood. He tried to get up, but something wrapped his whole body and pinned it in place. He gasped, and squirmed, and struggled against claustrophobic panic, but he couldn't move. He stopped struggling when he realized he was no longer on the ground, but instead eye level with her.

"That anger? Shove it down. Kill it. Control it or the power inside will control you, and then the Empire will hunt you down like the monster you've become. Do you understand?"

No, he did not understand. He didn't even know what happened, or what the Empire has to do with any of it, or why he would be a monster. He felt tears begin to form but stopped at the empty eyes looking back at him. She would kill him, he was sure.

He swallowed hard and pushed down the emotions as best he could. No, he did not understand at all, but he did understand pain.

He nodded.

"Good." She turned and walked back to the center of the training ground. He suddenly dropped to the ground as she turned around.

"Now, again."
