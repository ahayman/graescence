# 41 | The Line [Roland & Sal]

The apple tree was tall, thick, and still green against the burnt leaves of its brethren. The lower apples had either dropped off or were half-eaten on stem, leaving only a couple red flashes in the upper branches. Those branches rustled periodically, causing one of the apples to break free, hit two branches on the way down, then thud against the ground.

Sal eyed the apple, contemplative; he considered it but it lay within the rotting remains of others fated to feed the forest floor. He curled his lip and returned his eyes to the tree.

More rustling followed, then the tree sprouted a blond, curly haired head with twigs stuck throughout, as though the tree had somehow mistaken the dirty boy as its own progeny, and thus bestowed the leafage so obviously missing. The stem-crowned head slowly crept outward; the branch below began to dip; a hand reached up and stretched, just barely a finger below a particularly lush apple. The hand stretched and the finger barely tagged the fruit, causing it to sway. All at once the hand and head jumped up and the apple was plucked from its inaccessible perch.

"Aha!"

The head turned and gave Sal a triumphant grin before disappearing the apple.

A loud crack echoed, the head dropped a few fingers, and the grin disappeared. In it's place grew wide, shocked eyes.

Sal had barely taken a step when the branch broke fully, but instead of watching his friend fall, he somehow flew toward the center of the apple tree and wrapped his arms around the trunk. It seemed impossible, as though Roland had suddenly perfect footing from which to launch himself. Or, perhaps, the apple tree had become down for a moment, drawing Roland to it.

Blond curls pressed against the trunk, as though to salvation itself. Then, slowly, he began to shimmy his way down. Perhaps he'd just gotten lucky.

Roland was chuckling when his feet touched the soil, but it was a strained sound, and he was pale. He glanced behind the apple tree, toward the bleached bone branches of a Whitewood in the distance. Sal saw brief confusion, but it was gone half a second later.

Roland dug from his pockets two red and somewhat bruised-looking apples with a triumphant flourish. He looked between the two, one smaller and misshapen, the other the larger one he'd just risked his skin for.

"Better enjoy it," Roland said as he threw the larger one to Sal, "I almost died for that."

Sal twisted his lips while Roland bit off a piece from his own apple with about as much dignity as warthog in the mud. Juice dribbled off his chin as he chewed. Sal sunk his top incisors into his own apple and cleanly pulled off a chunk. He chewed while Roland wiped off his face with his sleeve, adding the juice to clothes already soiled with streaks of brown and green down the front.

Sal swallowed, then asked, "So how much further?"

Roland took another bite and shrugged. "Probably over that ridge," he said while chewing, cause more juice to dribble.

"We've been walking for four hours and twenty two minutes—"

"Is that all?"

"And we'll miss lunch."

"Oh? What's in your hand?"

Sal looked down at the Apple with a skeptical expression. "Not lunch."

Roland waved him off and walked away. "It'll be fine. We're almost there, I'm sure."

Sal had finished his Apple, without dribbling, when they started their ascent up the ridge in question. While Roland scrabbled up the incline, Sal mostly tried to pick out rocks and boulders to climb on. Leaves were suspicious; especially when they're fresh, crisp, and easily hid all kinds of mud.

Roland had removed his coat and tied it to his waist, exposing a cream colored shirt beneath... or it would have been had he not slipped twice already and slid through the dirt, rendering his shirt an earthen color. Sal couldn't take it; even for Roland this was bad.

"Can't we go around?"

Roland had started to slide again, but arrested his motion with a small sapling, which looked to barely support his weight. He arced his neck back.

"Around what? The ridge? It goes on for leagues."

"There's got to be easier places."

"Naw, this is the best place to climb." Roland grabbed another sapling and pulled himself up.

"How do you know that?" Sal's skepticism leaked.

"It just is. Besides, it's probably right over the next bend."

Sal glared at his friends back, certain he was making it all up. After six seconds of this and another five watching Roland slide again, Sal's expression softened. He'd known what he was getting into, and Roland was nothing if not stubborn once he got an idea in his head. Besides, it was not like he was willing to walk home alone.

Sal let out a sigh, and continued his own climb, trying to use Roland's attempts to help him navigate a path he hoped would keep him clean, or at least clean-ish.

The next bend did not, in fact, constitute the top of the ridge. Nor did the one after it, or the one after that. It was seven bends before they crested the ridge and twenty eight minutes after that before they realized it, and that only because down simply became more prevalent than up.

By this point the front of his shirt was almost as muddy as his shoes. Sal was almost tempted to give up his attempts to stay clean, but he still picked his way through the forest, careful to avoid any suspicious looking mud traps. Just habit.

He was walking through a relatively flat area before his senses told him something was wrong. There was nothing to suggest it. The trees were yellowed with autumn, working to cover grass that hadn't thought to brown yet. A light breeze, much welcomed, pushed through the trees and wormed their way through the layers of his coat, which he'd left open as much to keep cool as to keep clean in case he slipped.

It was a tingle maybe, a prickling of the skin; or perhaps a kind of pressure, the kind that tightens around the heart, just a little, easily dismissed under the exertion of the hike.

It was his breath and his steps, singular and alone, that drew his attention. He felt wrong, cut off, pressed down. His steps felt off, as though the ground rejected him, as though the world itself pressed on him to turn back.

And then he was suddenly and utterly alone.

He stopped, feeling as though he faced a wall. All that he stood free and clear, the feeling wouldn't budge.

His throat felt suddenly dry, breathing labored, arms leaden and weak. He turned on heel so fast he almost lost his balance.

Roland was only a dozen paces from him. For a brief moment, he appeared to have been frozen mid-step. Sal could walk to him. It would take six seconds. Nothing more, less if he ran. Yet for those six seconds, the distance was an impossible divide.

And Roland was speaking, not frozen; he pressed against the air itself. His face held confusion, frustration, anger, and behind it all, terror.

Panic crested as Sal's mind desperately tried to make sense of a world that had been suddenly made wrong. Nothing had changed. The world hadn't moved, or turned inside out, or done anything at all. Even as fear choked his throat, his mind kept insisting that nothing had changed, that nothing was wrong.

But Roland was speaking, and Sal couldn't quite make out the words. He suddenly felt like he was under water, unable to breath, unable to hear.

And over and over his mind blabbered: Why was only the mouth moving? Where was the sound?

He focused on Roland's mouth, trying to make sense of the words. The mouth was pleading, begging for something. It twisted and deformed repeatedly in an attempt to communicate.

Sal concentrated on the sound, warped though it was, as he sought to understand.

Slowly, by measures, comprehension seeped into his mind.

His friend was pleading for him to come back.

Sal's first step took all his effort, as though his feet had been bound to great boulders within the sea. His second step was easier. His third might have felt normal. By this fifth step he was running, and the twelfth step found him crashing into Roland, sending them both down with the crunch of dead leaves.

They untangled and pushed themselves back, away from the line, the invisible boundary of terror he'd been caught up in. It took a long time for his breath to slow down. He was sweating, flushed, and his mind looped over and over, trying to understand but still finding absolutely nothing wrong. He sat up, and a flurry of motion drew his eyes toward a flight of brown and white birds. He watched them fly right through where he'd once been standing.

"I couldn't... I couldn't get to you."

Sal turned to look at his friend. Roland lay flat on his back, staring up at the sky, or the canopy, or nothing at all.

"It was like a wall, but it pressed on _me_... not my skin," then he whispered, "me."

Tears began to lead from the edges of his eyes; his breath became shaky, shuddering as he breathed in.

"I'm sorry, I tried to get to you." He still hadn't looked at Sal.

Sal reach over and took his friend's hand in his own. He squeezed. "I came back."

"But I... couldn't—"

Roland squeezed his eyes shut and took a deep breath. He held it for twelve seconds while he squeezed Sal's hand so that it ached. He let his breath in one explosive outburst through his mouth, then let go of Sal's hand.

"I'm hungry," Sal said.

"Wha?" Roland shifted his head to look at Sal, then guffawed. "Eh... yeah. Me too."

"Let's go back?"

"Yeah," Roland sat up and picked a couple leaves out from his hair, leaving a few others. "Yeah, let's... not mention this... ever."

Sal nodded as both he and Roland got up. Roland began hiking without looking back, but Sal couldn't resist staring. There was nothing there, no line, no indication at all that just a few paces away the world would press down terror upon the unwary.
