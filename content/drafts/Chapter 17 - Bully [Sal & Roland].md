# 17 | Bully [Sal & Roland]

Roland made it to the road first. He stopped to catch his breath and wait for Sal, who arrived seven seconds later and doubled over.

"I... hate your... legs," Sal gasped out between breaths.

Roland snorted, but then froze with one cheek half-raised into a smirk. He cocked his head and stared down the road into town. Sal recovered three seconds later and followed his gaze, though he still remained doubled over, breathing hard.

"What?"

"A horse."

Sal straightened, then pulled sharply on his shirt. He rubbed at a mud stain and scowled at it when it didn't go away. "A what?"

"A horse. You know, four legs, people ride—"

"I know what a horse is." Sal rolled his eyes.

"Well, I saw one."

Sal furrowed his brow and peered toward town but saw nothing. "Where is everyone?"

They weren't far, maybe a hundred paces to the inn, which established the town edge. He should have seen at least someone loitering about. It was near lunch time, and the inn was an obvious spot for that sort of thing.

Roland turned to Sal, a wry smile on his face. "Sal, when was the last time you saw a horse?"

"Ummm..." Sal stopped examining his shirt and paused to think; his eyes grew wide. "Oh, you don't think—"

"I do! Come on!"

Roland took off running toward the Inn, which drew a groan from Sal. He almost ran to catch up but thought better of it. The inn wasn't _that_ far and, as excited as he was, he could wait the twenty three seconds it would take to walk there.

He still maintained a brisk pace until the road's packed dirt transitioned to cobblestone, just before the inn. He slowed and listened. There was a low murmur and excited whispers, and though he couldn't tell where they were coming from, he could guess.

He hopped onto the flat-stone porch that wrapped around the inn, shaded by under the roof overhang, and peered into the windows. No one, not even Laurice or her dad, could be seen. Disappointment and relief whirled in his stomach.

He followed the porch and stopped just as he rounded the corner. Beyond was a shaded courtyard, thirty paces wide and twenty paces deep, partially dug out from the hill behind the inn. Behind it were three stables cut into the rock; they were low and wide, designed for the Drajin lizards commonly used to haul sleds of lumber, and barely high enough to accommodate a horse.

The courtyard was filled with a small crowd of locals that had gathered a respectful distance around a dozen soldiers. Two of the soldiers had led four horses toward the back stalls, where an argument was heating up between one of them and Mr. Henderson, who shrugged at the curt gesture the soldier made toward the three stalls. Laurice stood a few paces behind her father; she had worried eyes and a pensive frown.

They all wore the same uniform, a green army canvas with a thick black stripe down their left shoulder, but the cloths were worn and frayed. Several of the men had faded stains visible and one hadn't buttoned theirs up correctly. All of them had a lance strapped to their back, the point rising straight up from behind their right shoulder a full two paces.

These were not the soldiers Sal remembered from a few years back, but they were still his people: brown skin, dark hair, almond eyes, and short, at least compared to the town folk, though not quite as short as Sal. Aside from his father, he hadn't seen anyone like them in a long time, not since the last Royal had visited years ago. Anxiety and curiosity surged in him as he watched the soldiers. They mostly ignored the locals that surrounded them, but more than one cast a disdainful glance toward the crowd.

Sal kept his eyes on the soldiers as he hopped off the porch and walked toward the crowd. A foot stomped down on his own just before he lifted it and sent him sprawling forward. He landed hard on his hands, scuffing his palms and straining his wrists, but he pushed himself up — and pushed down the anger that flared — quickly, with the intent of pretending it didn't happen.

"Watch where you step, you little sh—"

Sal turned around just in time to see Roland's fist crack against Preston's face. The boy's head snapped back, his body followed, and the boy was sent back to land hard on his ass.

Sal groaned, "not again..."

Roland stood over him, his lips pressed and twisted into a hard smirk, but his eyes were on fire and his hands bawled into fists.

"I'm sorry, Pres. You were saying what?"

The crowd parted around the two, drawing the attention of the soldiers. One of the soldiers took a step toward the boys, but was stopped by the palm of an older one who wore a uniform just a little more ornate than the others, and perhaps a little cleaner, though not by much.

"No, no," the older one said loudly, "let's see how the barbie runts fight."

An angry mutter rippled through the crowd. Barbie: uncivilized white barbarians who lived in the mountains, barely more than animals. The term would never have been uttered here, but if the soldiers were concerned they showed no sign, not that they had anything to fear with those lances strapped to their backs.

The two soldiers abandoned their argument with Mr. Henderson and joined the rest, who had stopped to watch the boys with casual interest and snide smiles. Several of the town's adults looked concerned, but none of them dared intervene with the soldiers there; besides, this wasn't the first fight between the boys.

Silence descended on the crowd.

In truth, the situation was almost the best case for Roland and by the eager look on his face, he knew it. In the past, he would have had his ass handed to him by Preston and his friends — the four boys that most often antagonized Sal — but at sight of the soldiers, Preston's friends had stepped back with the crowd, leaving he and Roland alone. Roland took a couple steps back and gave Preston room to get up, whose face looked as though he'd eaten something sour.

Preston rose, but then backed away. His turned back to his friends with pleading eyes, but they all took another step back. Preston's eyes flashed anger and he opened his mouth to speak.

"Well? Get on with it," said one of the soldiers.

Preston turned back to Roland and his eyes went hard. He balled his fists and stepped forward.

The boys circled each other, both reluctant to throw the first punch. Roland rarely threw the first punch and Preston had never fought without his friends at his back. Moreover, this had become a spectacle and that was something neither boy knew how to deal with.

Or — Sal cocked his head — Roland was simply enjoying the attention and Preston, shorter and stockier than Roland, didn't want to get within his reach.

Bored, one of the soldiers picked up and threw a rock, striking Roland in the head. Roland grunted and turned in surprise.

Preston swung wide, taking Roland in the jaw as he turned back. Roland's head snapped to the side; he followed it, spun, and hit the ground. The soldiers laughed as he pushed himself to his feet.

Preston's face lit up; he smiled and laughed with them, seeming unaware they did not laugh with him. Roland looked dazed and slowly shook his head, as though trying to clear it.

Sal frowned. Roland might look dazed, but his shoulders were tense. Sal knew his friend well enough to predict what came next.

Preston walked up and kicked Roland before he could regain his feet. Roland's hand snapped out, caught the kick, and pulled hard, earning a surprised yelp from the other boy. He jumped on Preston and rained down a flurry of blows.

Just as Preston cried out, Jordan sprinted and kicked Roland in the side and off of Preston. Roland rolled and came to his feet as though he'd intended it.

Sal leaned forward. Out of all of them, Jordan was the most reserved and the most dangerous; the boy knew how to fight and he had similar reach to Roland.

Jordan snapped out a jab and drew blood from Roland's lips. Roland jumped back and flashed Jordan a teethy smile.

Jordan feinted a second jab, then followed it with hook, but that missed as Roland leaned back. Roland followed with a blow that missed, then another and another which blended into a flurry of fierce blows that quickly overcame Jordan's clean style and put him on the defensive. After a few furious seconds, Roland's fist connected with Jordan's jaw, sending him around and to the ground; he didn't move.

Preston's eyes bugged behind a bloody face that already started to swell; this was not how their fights normally went. But Roland was a fierce fighter when he wasn't outnumbered, four to one, so these one-on-one battles suited him—

Oh. Never mind.

No, now it was three to one; Preston's other two flunkies stepped up and the soldiers looked more entertained than anything.

Sal tried step forward to even the odds but a hand grabbed his shoulder and stopped him. Sal froze; terror washed over him and he trembled. His father. He should be drunk already; he should be passed out at home. And Sal was dirty, his clothes stained; his father would beat him. His clenched his jaw, and slowly turned, half expecting the back of a thick hand to strike his face.

But it wasn't him.

It was the older soldier who'd sanctioned the fight.

"Never interrupt your enemies when they're fighting themselves," the soldier said.

"But—"

"No," the soldier squeezed Sal's shoulder painfully, "just watch and learn."

The three boys had spread out to surround Roland, who had backed away but still wore an eager look on a bloodied face. Sal rolled his eyes; Roland never was one to give up easily, or at all, or even recognize his own shitty situation. He still had the smile of someone expecting to win.

Seth lunged at him from the right, surprising the other two boys more than Roland, who dodged the attack and rushed Aden. Aden backed up and tripped, but not before Roland shoved the boy into the crowd.

Roland turned back and threw a wild punch that missed Preston, but managed to make him flinch enough that Roland's second throw took him in the nose. Preston reeled back, hand over a busted nose that was leaking blood. Sal chuckled; Preston's cheeks had swollen nicely and now his nose—  he really was getting the raw end of the deal.

Seth, who had circled around, struck Roland from the side with a wide blow, causing him to stumble and almost fall over. He wavered on his feet, eyes unfocused as he shook his head. He squeezed his eyes shut then opened them; they narrowed on a fist-sized tone in Seth's hand. He shot Seth an incredulous look that melted into disappointment.

"Not right..." Roland's words were blurred.

Aden burst from the crowd, rushed toward Roland, and took him in a tackle Roland barely had time to brace for. Aden wasn't a large kid, though again, not quite so small as Sal, but Sal was still surprised when Roland grabbed the boy by his mid-section, lifted him, and slammed him down on the cobblestone. Aden let out a weak cough and groaned; that could not have been pleasant, and Sal would know— Roland had perfected that move during their frequent "play-fights". Still, cobblestone... it just had to hurt.

Preston and Seth both descended on Roland, throwing too many punches and kicks for him to block. Roland backed away but his stunned look wasn't a feint this time. Preston stomped on his foot, tripping him. Aden had gotten up at this point, and joined the fray. Jordan had also sat up, but he didn't look interested in joining the fight.

At this point, Roland was done. The blows were coming from every direction and he simply curled up to protect as much as he could. And yet still, somehow, Sal would have sworn he saw his friend smile in between the blows.

"That's enough!" Mr. Henderson roared. His gravelly voice echoed through the courtyard as he pushed through the crowd and pulled the three boys off Roland.

He glared at the crowd. "Out! Out of my courtyard! Get! You should be ashamed of yourselves."

All four boys suddenly disappeared.

Mr Henderson turned his glare to the soldiers and almost looked to speak, but then turned and spat on the ground. The crowd slowly dispersed. The soldiers turned away to handle horses or head into the inn. They passed money between themselves as they left.

The hand on Sal's shoulder squeezed.

"You want out of this rat hole," the soldier said from behind him, "you come see me before the day's end." He squeezed again, then walked off without looking at Sal.

Sal walked over as Roland pushed himself to his knees. He looked disoriented, bloody, and still somehow, incredibly, he looked happy. Mr Henderson reached down and helped Roland up as Sal approached.

"You're a fool boy, you know that?"

Roland flashed him bloody teeth. "I almost had them."

Mr. Henderson scoffed, "Like hell you did. You just don't learn, do you?"

"Try, try, try again..."

That earned gruff laugh. "Gods below, you're thick."

Mr. Henderson shook his head, turned, and walked back toward the horses. As Sal watched him, his eyes alighted on Laurice. She was staring at him, head cocked, her expression curious. Sal flushed and turned back to Roland.

"You didn't have to do that."

Roland shook his head. "Did."

"I was just going to ignore them."

Roland shook his head harder, but wavered a bit from it. "Nope. No.” He widened his eyes after an exaggerated blink. “That would just encourage them."

He blinked several times, squeezed his eyes shut, lifted his hand to his head.

"Can't believe he used a rock."

Sal opened his mouth but Roland waved him off.

"I know, I know... gods, I'm so hungry. Why aren't we eating?"

Roland turned and walked into town, his steps slightly shuffled, his path only a little wobbly. Sal watched him with his mouth ajar; then he shook off his daze and jogged to catch up to the only friend he'd ever known.
