# 55 | Heights [Terra]

Terra knelt over the scored line of stone and scraped at it. Solid. She tapped it next, then frowned at the sound— it wasn't hollow.

"I'm afraid you'll not find what you seek," Ven said without looking up. He had his arms deep within his bags, searching for something.

Terra watched him for a moment. He'd probably had found whatever he was looking for already had he not callously stuffed everything in without regard to reason. She pushed her irritation down and stood, then began systematically examining the stone around the score, randomly tapping the stone with her shoe, looking for something, _anything_ that might suggest entry. The anchor had to be beneath the portal but the depth was somewhat variable between anchors. Still, anything more than a few feet stretched the imagination.

"Ah here it is! For a moment there, I was afraid she'd figured me out."

Terra paused her examination to shoot him an irritated glance, but froze as she took in the artifact he held. It was a graetech sword, but far finer than any she'd seen, and she'd seen some exquisite craftsmanship. This one, though, had a gold or bronze filament woven throughout both blade and hilt. Like veins of gold in stone, it looked as though someone had intentionally replaced specific grains of the elderin wood with metal. How such a thing could be done, though, boggled her mind.

She breathed out. "What..."

"Exquisite artifact, is it not?" Ven swung the sword in large arcs before bringing it vertical to admire the blade. "I tell you, dear sister, the best of Cardonia are naught but toys to this. Just feeding it feels..." he cocked his head, "sublime. Though I had to settle for one shorter than I prefer."

Terra struggled to understand. Her brother held in his hands a thing that should have been held under lock and key, deep in a vault, guarded by a full compliment, and available only to the most trusted. Her brother held in his hands an object so rare and valuable that he could possibly buy himself his own Chair with it— or, well, not really, but still.

"A relic?"

"Indeed, and but one of a hoard, I would say."

"A hoard?" She looked sharply at him. "Speak plainly, brother. How did you acquire this?"

He glanced at her, eyebrow raised. "Would you believe that woman has dozens of artifacts like this? And that they are locked behind nothing more than a simple door lock?"

No, she did not. "I will ask again. How did you acquire this?"

"That boy had figured it out first, I believe. Clever, placing just enough paper..." he trailed off, shaking his head. "Did you not wonder that a clearly peasant barbarian boy had somehow gained possession of a weapon that could beggar a minor Royal?"

She had, but that wasn't the point. "You distract. Explain yourself. Surely, even you would not be such a fool as to mortgage our chair—"

"Really, Sister?" His expression turned long suffering. "You think I would make such deals with that woman? No. I daresay she won't know it missing... or well, not for a long bit at least."

Terra's breath came to a halt as she approached him. "You... stole it?" she hissed in accusation. "You? You have turned our Chair into common thieves. You disgraced our mother—"

"Oh come off it. That barbarian wo—"

The smack of her hand across his face echoed off the stone.

He turned back to her slowly, but there was no anger in his eyes. If anything, he appeared relaxed in a way she hadn't seen him for a long time. He sighed, then turned and walked back to his bag, shaking he head as if in disappointment. A few moments later, he'd threaded a belt and mounted his stolen weapon to his hip.

"The cliffs are no good," he said, gesturing out to the impressive view beyond. "Even had we proper hardware, I daresay the descent would be perilous indeed. Even should we not fall, the exposure alone would assure our demise," he glanced down, "if not other dangers."

He walked across their small plateau, barely more than a ledge really, toward the opposite side, whereby the view consisted mostly of more granite mountains.

He pointed, "There. And then... there," he pointed again. "We make for that ravine. We shall arrive before nightfall, luck willing, and shelter there for the night or, I fear, we may find ourselves at quite the disadvantage against both element and beast."

"We are not done spea—"

"Yes dear sister, we are. For while I'm sure it is quite the breathtaking view that invites you to such leisurely discourse, I do not wish it to be the last thing thing I see. Unless, of course, you wish die here on this ledge from exposure?"

Terra paused, her rage partially forestalled. She stared out at the world so far below, and felt the cold eat through her clothes.

Without a word, she walked past her brother to her luggage, and began to remove clothes from it, stacking them neatly on the stone beside her, until she'd found a coat better suited to the cold. When she stood, her brother had removed rope from his own pack.

"Did you steal that too?"

"I did at that— do not stare at me so. I would have bought it if I could, but having no other recourse, theft is better than dying."

"Oh! So you somehow knew she was going to dump us on the top of a mountain, did you?"

He paused, looking conflicted. "I'll admit," he blinked, speaking slowly, "this was well outside the scenarios I'd considered. And, yet, it was all but certain she would not let us go, not with what that boy could do."

That took Terra aback— had he been actually paying attention?

She stiffened her spine. "I'm sure I don't know of what you speak."

"Don't play nescient; it only makes you look the fool. You know as well as I that boy has ability well beyond any normal person."

"I'll admit, he has traits that could make him a valuable asset." She watched closely.

"Yes, yes," he waved his hand dismissively, "but I speak of more than pulling me off balance in a fight."

So he _did_ know. She stared at him, brow raised, waiting for him to say more. Instead, he flashed her a insincere smile and walked over to his luggage. A variety of apparel began to pile up around him as he emptied the containers.

"Ah, here it is."

Out came a traveller's pack, dark green and worn, but fully waxed. She frowned at it, reasonably certain he hadn't stolen that from Lady Rose, if only because it was a thing the Lady wouldn't own.

"Have you carried that thing around this whole time?"

He ignored her and reached into the bag. He pulled out a rather large hunting knife, plain looking but graetech— which made it absurdly expensive —and flipped it over so he was holding the tip. He looked at it with regret for a moment, sighed, then offered it to her.

She stared at it suspiciously, trying to decide whether taking stolen goods would besmirch her own self. She opened her mouth.

"No," he said, "sister, I did not steal it. I purchase it quite some time ago— you _do_ recall I hunt, yes?"

"I... do, of course." Although from what she understood, to call it hunting was to be exceedingly generous.

"I fear you will have occasion to need this far more than you'd like, or have you not yet divined our current emplacement of exile?"

He looked almost... eager, and she didn't understand that at all. She ignored his offering and walked back to the edge of the cliff, looking out once again over the world. This time she ignored the beauty and focused on the geography, where sheer cliffs descended down into rolling foot hills.

Her spine stiffened. "I look down upon Teres, do I not?" she said without turning away from the view.

"You are."

She shivered from something other than the cold. "Then we stand upon the edge of..."

"The Elderall, yes."

She stared down with longing. "Surely it would be better—"

"Look closely. Do you see the black specs flying at just about the cloud line?"

The cloud line was barely more than light wisps of fog. She had to peer closely to spot them against the granite, and then again to see these specs her brother had spoken of.

"Birds?"

He snorted. "Perhaps if a bird were thrice your size."

She looked up in surprise.

"Wyverns, I dare say, or that is what they rumour a least."

"Wyvers? Like dragons? You speak of myths, brother."

"Leathery wings, reptile like body?" he shrugged. "Call them what you like, but supposing we had the equipment to scale down, they would simply pluck us from the cliffs to dash the rocks below."

"And so what, our options are to attempt to scale certain death, or else brave the most dangerous forest in all the world?"

He laughed. "Dear sis, we would have to make it to that forest first, and that is no certain thing."

He smacked the flat of the hunting knife against her stomach, causing her to reflexively grab the weapon. He patted her hand, then walked back to his luggage and began folding clothes.

She followed him absently, her mind still trying to wrap itself around the absurdity that had become their situation. They should be well on their way home, not stuck on the top of a mountain filled with monsters, planning to brave a forest also filled with monsters, a forest with a reputation of killing of entire expeditions, _entire expeditions_, the least of which would contain no less than forty well trained and well prepared adventurers, a caravan filled with guards and supplies and wagons, and _fools_ willing to brave the worst the world has to offer for just a chance at the wealth guarded within, even knowing that less than twenty percent ever made it back out.

And yet now, _now_ her brother was folding his cloths. Folding them. Now, of all the times.

"Why are you so calm?"

He paused half way in the process of folding a pair of thick trousers. His finger tapped them lightly while he thought.

He tilted his head toward her, though it was still mostly turned away. "You will want to separate your clothes, choosing only the warmest that can fit in your smaller bag. We must find a way to secure it to your person— I'll think on it some —but until then, I ask that you turn away. I need to change."

She opened her mouth.

"Sister," he turned to her fully, "could we perhaps discuss your reservations later? We are at present on the top of a mountain, exposed to extreme cold and I fear it will be merely a matter of minutes before we suffer the effects of it."

Terra stared at his back as he turned back to his task. She wanted to be furious— she _was_ furious —and yet well aware that she had no right to be, or not at him at least.

"Gloves!" he shook his head, "I forgot gloves. How could I have managed such a lapse."

"I have several pairs," she said, distracted, "I will fetch them."

He raised his head, looking slightly surprised, then thoughtful. He nodded and turned back to his task.

She fetched her gloves, though absently— they'd been neatly stacked along the edge of her luggage —and gave them to her brother with reluctance. He chose two, and she watched with mild horror as her brother laid them neatly on the stone, then mutilated them with a smaller version of the hunting knife he'd given her, scoring the stone beneath in the process. He cut off both finger tips and the lace around the wrist, explaining both how the lace could get caught and how they needed their fingers for the climb.

"Why do you have two knives?"

He looked at her for a moment, made to speak, but closed his mouth and shook his head. Again with the disappointment. Her lips tightened, but... what could she say? She was far out of her element. It was just... he also should have been out of his element. Yet, if anything, the opposite was true.

He gave her a look, then proceeded to unbutton his shirt. She turned away quickly.

She tried sorting her clothes but he intervened after a bit, examining fabric, discarding some she'd chosen, choosing others she discarded. Some fabric, though thin, was reasonably water proof— that was important, he said. She had only one pair of boots that would suffice, and only that because society had recently decided buckles were in fashion.

She gasped and sputtered when he began cutting a particularly expensive garment into long strips. These were fashioned around her smaller bag in such a way that she could secure them to her back.

It all made sense, everything he did. He'd thrown out the richest of his clothing, choosing to pack only the hardiest, which he shouldn't have owned. Much of it she'd never seen before, couldn't have imagined him owning. Yet clearly he did. He'd changed into them, in fact, and she couldn't reconcile the person before her. None of his clothing was bad, but neither was it something any self-respecting Royal would ever be caught in. Hardy material in muted, drab colors... it was as if she'd secretly had two brothers, twins in fact, and she was just now being introduce to the other... a brother raised in the wild no less.

She gestured at him. "How is it you own this?"

"We've discussed this, or has the cold begun to eat your mind already?"

Without waiting for a reply, he bent over his pack and carefully finished arranging it.

"Yes, but I've seen hunts leave the city, and not once have I seen any Royal wear anything like... that."

He snorted an indelicate sound of disgust. "Those are not hunts, but tours given to fools that only want their pride stroked at the cost of a hobbled animal."

She frowned, confused more than anything. But, wasn't that exactly what he did?

He rose and shouldered his pack, then gestured at the mountains. "Let us be away then."

She blinked as he walked away from her, still trying to process too many sudden changes. Her whole world had shifted out from under her within a matter of minutes and while she certainly maintained a calm exterior as befit her station, inside she felt moments from panic.

"Why are you so calm?" she whispered as he fasten his rope around a ragged outcropping.

It wasn't even that he was calm. It was more than that. He looked... content, happy even, and it was, she realized, the first time she'd ever seen that before.

"I will go first," he said, tying off the other end of the rope around his waist. "Once over I'll secure this end. Tie the rope around your waist and follow the path I take." He paused. "I highly recommend you don't look down."

Without waiting for a reply, he began to scale the cliff with a kind of practiced efficiency that strongly suggested he'd done it before. She watched in mild bafflement as he skipped hand holds that looked perfectly fine to her, and dug his fingers into crevasses she hadn't even noticed.

She could barely see the ledge that was his goal, and only that if she leaned out dangerously. It was further down quite a ways, far enough that she doubted his length of rope would suffice, though she couldn't quite tell with the way he'd coiled it. It'd been secured to his hip using some kind of graetech device she'd never seen, slowly letting out the rope as needed.

It took him perhaps half an hour before he disappeared onto the ledge. As she watched, his hand stuck out, thumb up. Did that mean go? She almost shouted at him before realizing that announcing herself to every monster around just might not be the better idea.

She looked at the rope for a long time, then sat down on the ledge and stared out into the mountains. Everything was impossible. People didn't just form gates anywhere they pleased. That wasn't a thing. Her brother was fop, except he knew how to scale mountains. She was sitting on one of the tallest ridges in the world, planning to brave the most dangerous place in the world she knew of. She was going to die— it wasn't even a question. She was... and she was supposed to be going home. Everything had changed in a matter of moments and the only one who seemed prepared for it was her neurotic, paranoid fop of a brother.

Movement caught her eye. She glanced over to see her brother leaning out, still secured by the rope, gesturing for her to go.

She was breathing too fast. She slowed it and dabbed the wet of her eyes on her sleeve. Not very lady like but there was no one around. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly, then got up and examined the rope.

At least her brother had the wits to steal good rope. It was abnormally soft, almost silk-like, which likely meant it'd been woven from the fiber of Elderin leaves. It was again a thing she didn't understand because usually only the finest clothes were made of that stuff. Not rope. Yes, the rope would be almost indestructible, but it'd also cost as much as a small home.

And she was procrastinating.

She untied it, looped it around her waist twice, then tied it off in a double not. She leaned out over the edge, but her brother was no longer in sight and she suddenly felt very alone. She stared at the cliff.

"I, Terra va Belcia, am going to scale a mountain. I am a Belcia, and I'm going to scale a mountain... right. Okay then."

Terraria va Belcia had spent hardly any time imagining what it was like to scale a mountain— why would she? She was only distantly aware that this was a thing some people did, but she'd never known anyone who'd taken it up, or even why someone would want to. People were strange and did weird things for stupid reasons. It was just an unfortunate truth in the world.

Hanging off a cliff? That was stupid. It was also a frigid, painful experience. The wind whipped at her clothes in a bipolar effort to either rip her off the mountain or freeze her to it. Her fingers had first gone numb, then settled into a throbbing pain. Her arms quivered and her toes ached. The people who did this willingly were, she concluded, utterly devoid of sense, masochists in search of a painful death.

She tried to follow her brother's path as closely as possible, if for no other reason than that he looked like he knew what he was doing. She even skipped the easy looking handholds in favor of the smaller ones she'd seen him use. The further she went, though, the harder those handholds were. It wasn't that they got smaller, but she was getting tired of digging her fingertips into places barely large enough. She couldn't _grasp_ any of them properly.

At a quarter of the way, she had a choice. There was a thin crevasse that went over and up slightly, before descending down. But it was very narrow, the edges were sharp, and there were few places to put your feet. The alternative went down and under, but it had much nicer places to put both hands and feet. Her brother had chosen the upper path. She decided then that her brother was, as shameful as it was to admit, a masochist.

The lower path was indeed easier, and she began to make good time. She was congratulating herself when one of her hand holds pulled away from the mountain. She squawked in surprise as she flailed, then screamed when her foot came loose. She managed to hold on with one hand for a few seconds before her fingers began to slip. She lost two fingernails as gravity tore her from her last hold.

The rope had been pulled taught the moment she'd screamed. As she fell, it tightened painfully around her waist, cutting off her scream as it began to redirect her downward momentum into a pendulous swing. She smacked the cliff side first with her back, of which her luggage pack took the brunt, then her shoulder, and finally her head.

The world exploded into colors as she went limp. She'd not lost consciousness, but neither was she lucid. She swayed upside down, almost gently, before the rope jerked upwards in a rhythmic fashion. Each time it did, the rope tightened more and more until she was certain it would squeeze her in half. She kept trying to say something but her mouth wouldn't form the words at first. Finally, she managed it.

"Stop," but it was only a whisper. "Please?"

The rope jerked again and she threw up as it tightened. It ran up her face and into nose. She sputtered, but the effort left her feeling even more light headed. She drifted out of consciousness, then back in. Each time she was sure she'd been cut in half. At one point she thought she begged to be dropped, but she wasn't sure if it'd been a dream.

The jerking stopped, leaving her to swing lightly in the breeze. She felt warm which probably probably wasn't good, but the thought didn't take hold.

Something wrapped around her ankle and lifted her up. She was grateful it wasn't the rope until she felt the back of her leg scrape against the cliff edge. It was just her calf but it _hurt_ and she yelled out. Pain brought a new awareness, the first of which was the realization that he other leg was splayed out in quite an indecent manner. She brought up and hooked it over the edge next to her other one.

If Terra hadn't had a rope squeezing her in half, she might have been able to sit up enough to grab either the ledge or her brothers hands. Maybe. Her pack was heavy, so maybe not. But even attempting it caused waves of pain to radiate from her waist. A moment later, the decision was removed from her as another hand grasped her other ankle and pulled at her, raking her legs and but over the cliff edge until her luggage pack caught the edge.

She was bent backwards, which might not be painful on its own except for the rope still cutting into her trumped all. Her brother cursed something foul as he pulled again to try to force the issue, but she was well and truly stuck. He'd cinched the pack to her quite well.

A moment later and she felt her legs twist. Her hips followed. Then, her torso. He was literally rolling her over and the motion only caused the rope to dig and burn into her flesh. She tried to scream at him, but couldn't catch her breath.

Immediately, he pulled, raking her stomach across the edge. Another moment was wasted while her shirt bunched up beneath her breasts. She felt panic when she heard a deep intake of breath, and scrambled to get her arms underneath her before he scraped off her breasts. That alone probably saved her face from the cliff edge, but the effort took everything out of her.

Her brother immediately removed the pack from her back, rolled her over, and began examining her, even as he was gasping for air. She screamed and clawed at his fingers when he tried to untie the rope. He smacked her hands away and dug at her until the rope finally came loose. This released a new wave of pain that drove her into unconsciousness.

---

"Terra? Sister? I need you to wake up."

Terra gasped awake, sputtering as she felt her waist. It was still there, though extremely painful to the touch. Of course it was still there. She'd be dead if it had actually cut her in half, and yet...

She lay back down, closed her eyes, and groaned. Everything hurt. Her waist, her hips, her shoulder, her head, her stomach... everything. And it was so cold she couldn't stop shivering.

"If you're done lying about," he said with casual sarcasm, "perhaps we could continue off this mountain before we freeze?"

Rage filled her. She snarled and scrambled to her feet, knife in hand. She'd formed an edge instinctively and had almost lunged at him. She stopped short of actually murdering her brother, though she kept her knife pointed at him.

He didn't even flinch. He just looked at her, assessing.

"Good," he said after a moment, then turned away and gestured. "We'll next endeavour that path there, where I believe we can make for that ledge down there. I'm afraid our rope won't help for this. We'll have to free climb it."

"I almost died," she hissed through her teeth.

"But you did not, and unless you wish to die here in truth, we must continue on."

She hissed out her displeasure, wanting nothing more than to lash out at him, as though he were the cause of all this. But he wasn't and as angry as she was, it would do no good to assault her brother, who was still gesturing down the cliff.

She closed her eyes and worked her mouth for several seconds before composing herself enough to shove her rage back down.

It took her a second to find the ledge he'd spoken of. It was far, far below. She shuddered at the thought of actually climbing down to it. Her eyes trailed up to look at the "path" he'd mention. It wasn't a path at all, but a ledge that angled down sharply. It wasn't even complete. There were parts where it disappeared altogether before reappearing several paces beyond and it was barely half a foot deep; her heels would literally be hanging over the edge. Their only redemption was that the cliff face angled away from them, which would allow them to hug the stone.

Terra's knife arm dropped limply to her side. She slowly looked up at her brother.

"You kid."

"If you have any better ideas, I'm game."

She closed her eyes, jaw tense. "You know I don't."

He let out the kind of exasperated sigh one uses on an unruly child. The grip of her knife tightened.

"The good news, I believe it will get easier from there. There's a gentle slope we can rappel down into the valley."

Terra didn't bother looking. She'd seen it; it wasn't gentle.

"Fine. Let's go."

She replaced her knife into her belt, walked to over to the edge, and crossed her arms. "Well?"

He grunted out an amused sound as he followed. He paused next to her.

"Please do try to stay on the mountain this time?"

She snarled something indecipherable as he shuffled onto the path while practically laying against the mountain side. Yet for all that, he didn't look uncomfortable or uncertain. He just looked like it was perfectly normal to hug a mountain thousands of feet in the air while standing on a ledge with naught but his toes holding him up from a certain death.

She had to resist the urge throw a rock at him.

She probably would have done just that had she realize how distinctly uncomfortable it would be for her in particular. The back and forth shuffling against cold stone quickly overcame her admittedly soft undergarments that nevertheless had not been designed with the idea of oscillating friction. After an hour of this, she alternated entertaining thoughts of killing either her brother, or the designer of her garments. Either would suffice, but death would come slowly by way of high grit sandpaper.

Despite the wind, the cold, the chaffing, and two harrowing moments where they had to actually climb over a gap in the path, they made it safely to the ledge. The sun had already crested zenith and begun a slow trek toward the horizon. At the very least, they were no longer in shadow. The sun was inviting.

Terra lay back against the stone to soak up the warmth while she tenderly prodded her hips and lower torso. Nothing inside her felt damaged, just her hips and her skin, which was sticking to her clothes. She was certain it would scar, but she couldn't find in herself to care. Her head pounded a migraine to the beat of her heart, reminding her loudly that she was not dead yet while strongly suggesting it may be the preferable state.

"We cannot rest," her brother said, "we must make for the valley now."

She didn't open her eyes. "I dare disagree."

"You would, but I don't believe you understand the severity of our situation."

"I understand my flesh torn, I'm cold, I'm exhausted, some little man is mining the inside of my skull, and my stomach is—" she sat up, grunting from the pain, "do we have food?"

He hesitated, then nodded. "Yes, but not much."

"Give it to me."

Her brother looked at her long, then seemed to reach a decision. He reached into his back and pulled out hard tack and a back of nuts. He showed them to her, then paused.

"You eat, then we go."

"Are you blackmailing me with food?"

"I am trying to keep us alive. The night's cold will make today feel like a hot summer day. We will not survive it without shelter."

Terra took a deep breath, then nodded. She took the offered nuts, but rejected the tack. She wasn't sure her stomach could handle it.

As she ate, her brother started doing things with his rope. He first threw it down, grunted, then drew it back up, coiling it as he did. He did that two more times, each down a different part of the cliff. He then took the two ends in one hand, then threw the coil down, effectively halving the length. From there, he move along the edge, whipping the rope out on occasion to readjust it. Occasionally, he'd pull it up a little then whip it back out. After a couple minutes he seemed to make a decision and coiled the rope back up.

As he did, Terra leaned forward. There was blood on the rope. She frowned, then stared intently at his hands. He was still wearing her thin gloves, tips cut off, but of the palms nothing was left but crusted blood. She flinched as she realized it must have happened when she fell.

"Are you quite finished yet," he said without turning around. "We must be away soon."

She glanced down at the last of her nuts, the tipped the bag into her mouth until it was empty. She got up, shouldered her pack, and very carefully tied it around her waist. It was higher than the rope had been, but the whole area was tender.

"I am... sorry."

She looked up, brow raised in both confusion and expectation.

"I did not..." he trailed off and took a deep breath before trying again. "There are ways to secure oneself that result in less... damage, during a fall. I hadn't considered that— I will teach it to you next time, I promise."

She frowned as he turned away without waiting for an answer. She watched as he carefully placed a loop of rope around an outcropping of rock. As apologies went, his was poor... but also rare. She didn't know what to make of it. He almost looked guilty, which wasn't an emotion she'd thought him capable of.

"To rappel, you must take the rope up through the crotch—"

"Excuse me!"

"Just listen. Through the legs, like so— you'll sit on the rope in a way —and then up and around the shoulder and down the back to the other hand. See? Hold each side of the rope with each hand. You can control your descent by lessening your grip, or even manually moving the rope if you wish. I will chafe, I'm sorry, but there's no getting around it. As you descend, you go down backwards or sideways. Only do sideways for gentler inclines, where you're not at risk of— actually, just go down backwards. It's safer. Now, come. I want to show you something."

He walked to the edge and leaned over. "See that lip there?"

She nodded.

"We will go over that lip. I believe there is a ledge beneath it we can use to reset the rope."

Her brow shot up. "You... believe?"

"I cannot see it any better than you, but the rope seemed to drag. With luck, I can secure the rope again to something there."

"And if not?"

"Then we must use the rope's full length and I am unsure we can reclaim it. There are knots that might suffice, but it is no certain thing and I have little practice with them."

He turned to her. "Show me how to arrange the rope."

She did, mimicking his initial presentation. He nodded, then adjusted a few things.

He nodded. "Good, but not around your pack. If it slips, it will jerk and you may loose your balance."

"Less comfortable," she muttered.

"Fold your jacket between your legs. It'll add padding."

She did, and though it was awkward and she wasn't sure if it'd stay— her jacket had a split tail —it would help the chaffing for as long as it lasted.

Her brother nodded, lips tight. "Good. I'll go first. Watch closely and follow what I do."

She dropped the rope as he picked it up and arranged it around himself. He spared her glance, gripped tight the rope, and leaned out over the edge, rope taught. Terra walked to the edge as he descended, noting how he was sitting into the rope as he walked backwards down the cliff. He went slowly, checking his steps as he went, but even that didn't stop him from slipping on a loose rock.

Terra couldn't help but giggle a little when his head lightly smacked the cliff as he scrambled to get his feet under him. Soft curses drifted up.

"Should I copy that too?" she yelled down to him.

"Quite so."

She lightly touched the bruise on her head as he got his feet back under him. He made it to the lip, then stopped when he was perched on it. He looked below the lip for a bit, then back up at her. He gave her a sharp nod then jumped off, allowing the rope to slide through his hands as he fell. The rope swayed twice before is slackened.

Terra stared for a minute before she realized it was her turn. She'd grabbed the rope and, before she should think about what she was doing, she'd leaned herself over the ledge. She swallowed a wave of vertigo as she looked down, then slowly allowed the rope to slide through her fingers.

The climb down was surprisingly mundane. She didn't slip and her balance remained good. The lip proved tricky, though, as there was no place for her feet beyond it and with her hands taken up by the rope, she couldn't climb down. Her only option was to jump like her brother did.

"Don't let go too much when you jump, but you need fall far enough that you don't—"

"Yes, brother. I get it."

"Just remember to stop yourself—"

"I said I have it!"

"—or you'll run out of rope."

"I've. got. it," she growled through clenched teeth.

She spared a glance at the rope, of which there wasn't much left. One deep breath and she jumped.

The rope slid, she clinched her hands a moment later, causing her to swing in. Hands wrapped around her waist and stabilized her while her feet touched the ledge.

"Exhilarating, is it not?"

She slapped his hands away, opening eyes she only now realized she'd closed. "Not."

She sat down, legs dangling, as she tried to slow down her heart. This was not her definition of fun. Her brother sat next to her and chewed on a piece of tack. After a few minutes, she her anger got the best of her.

"I thought we had to hurr— _why_ are you smiling?"

"And why should I not? Look at where we are! Have your eyes beheld such a view before? We sit upon stone peaks that would beggar our greatest spire!"

"You speak of beauty when death would claim us?"

"Yes, and why not?" he turned to her. "Each day may be our last— this I do not deny —but why should that cloud our eyes to the raw beauty before us? If we are to die, why then die in misery when we could perish with wonder in our hearts?"

Terra's brow drew together, perplexed. She shook her head. "I do not know you, brother. I fear I never did."

"Look," he swept his arm out, "at what lies before us and tell me I am wrong."

She clenched her teeth, eyes closed, and blew out her nose a sharp breath. But she opened and looked, really looked.

The view was austere but Terra could not help admit it was quite beautiful. They were surrounded by stone peaks with sharp edges that pierced a thin cloud line. They'd been above those clouds only hours ago, but she could not recall crossing the line. Below, the stone gradated into rubble mixed with patches of grass— not much, really, but between two of the peaks could be seen more greenery in the distance. It wasn't the Elderall forest, but there might be water. She saw no animals at all, and she could not decide if that was good or not.

There were rumours that the mountains held the greatest of monsters, but no one had confirmed it. How could they? They'd have to survive the Elderall first, and the survival rate of that was abysmal. Most expeditions ventured only far enough to cut down an Elderin or two and rush back. Even that run lost well over half the expeditions, though those that returned were set for life.

"The spires hold great beauty as well," she said after a time.

He chuckled. "That they do, but they are not this."

"I'd rather them than this."

He flinched, his smile fading. "I know, but it is what we have." He stood and began pulled on one end of the rope, coiling it up. "But you're right; we have little time to waste. We'll make for the valley there." He pointed toward the greenery.

"That was not our original goal."

"Hmm," he nodded, "green means water, and we will need water sooner than later."

He finished coiling the rope, grabbed both ends, then ran them through his palm until he found center. That he looped around an outcropping before casting the rope out.

He turned to her. "Ready?"

She stood and brushed herself off. "No."

"Good. Let's go."

---

It was the way he talked, different now. Ven had always used flowery sarcasm to mock those around him. In fact, Terra had long since assumed that was the only way he knew how to speak— she'd never heard otherwise. Until now. The flowery language now seemed reserved for her alone, but when he spoke of their situation, every trace of it was gone.

She stared at his back as they scrambled over loose rock, slowly making their way toward the now hidden valley of green they'd seen before. He breathed lightly, in contrast to her more labored breath, which was confusing. Terra had always considered herself at least as strong and fit as her brother, but she was unused to this sort of effort and it showed, though perhaps more than it should— she swore the air was different, thinner somehow.

But it was the way he talked that bothered her most. It forced on her a creeping realization that she didn't know her brother. It threw everything off. Their modes of conversing, their mutual antagonism, her anger and disappointment in him— was it all just a ruse?

It felt like betrayal, like a friend who secretly hates you, except this was a brother who was... secretly someone else?

She shook her head. She was spinning in circles.

The air was not only thin, but dry, and her mouth was quickly following suit. They weren't too much further before the ridge when her brother stopped suddenly.

"What?"

"Do you feel it?"

She paused, frowning. "It's colder."

He nodded. "It's dropped a few degrees in the last couple minutes. Why?"

She raised an eyebrow. "Cause we're in the mountains?"

"It's afternoon, too early to cool off and there's barely a cloud in the sky, so not a cold front."

"So? It's getting colder. More reason to find shelter."

"Yeah..." he started looking around, then pointed toward an alcove. "There."

He half sprinted off toward the alcove, jumping between rocks and moving quick enough that Terra struggled to keep up. He ignored every every attempt she made to slow, and by the time they'd made it to the alcove she'd stumbled twice on loose rocks.

"Was... that... truly necessary?" she gasped out between breaths.

He ignored her, peering out in search of something. At least he was breathing harder, but not nearly so much as she— it was infuriating. She rolled her eyes as she caught her breath, as much at herself as him. Jealousy was a thing beneath her.

"I daresay this shelter will prove insufficient for our needs tonight."

"Shush."

"You do _not_ shush— ack!"

She struggled as he slapped his hand over her mouth. She almost bit him before recalling how bloody his hand had been, then she recoiled in disgust.

"Quiet, or do you somehow fail to recall where we are?" he hissed.

His hand was still over her mouth and she had a strong urge to hit him, but the fear in his eyes forestalled her. She closed her eyes, shoved down her anger, and jerked her head into a nod.

He slowly removed his hand, wary as though she might still hit, bite, or yell at him. Admittedly, she hadn't fully discarded any of the options.

"Watch," he said, turning back to look out, "it's _still_ getting colder."

It was, and not just a few degrees. It approached the cold of the mountain top. Terra wrapped her arms around herself and settled in.

Her brother's words had rattled her. She hadn't forgotten where they were, but she had stopped paying attention amidst the effort of not falling off the mountain to her death. That, and it was easier to think of monsters still as children's tales than something real that could kill her.

"There."

She stared where he pointed but saw nothing, just the cliff side. She glanced at her brother, confused, but his eyes were clearly locked on something. She followed his gaze again, but there was noth— a breeze blew through and the cliff _rippled_.

Eyes wide, she breathed out, "What?"

Whatever it was, it was massive, towering over the rubble they'd struggled to climb over. It was vaguely cat-like, and very clearly powerful. More importantly, her head wouldn't even reach the thing's shoulder. It's fur was the color of stone, barely noticeable. Standing still, it would all but disappear, but it was visible if you knew it was there, if only barely. It had it's nose in the ground, sniffing the very spot they'd been climbing.

"Look at the paws," her brother whispered.

"Sharp."

"No— I mean yes, but not that. Look at the ground."

"It... glistens?"

"It's freezing the ground."

"That's not possible."

He cocked his head. "What was it you studied? Traits, I believe, like the boy has?"

"Traits apply to people, nitwit, not animals."

"Nitwit, really?" he shook his head. "I'd recommend you keep your biased opinion in che— ah damn."

"What?"

"It has better hearing than I'd guessed."

Terra's head whipped back toward the beast. Her breath caught to see it staring right at them.

"No way but forward," Ven said as he stood.

"Brother! You cannot fight that... thing."

"I don't seem to have much of a choice," he said, then walked out of their alcove.

The beast lowered its head as he emerged into the light. Ven shifted his stance, knees bent, weight balanced on the balls of his feet. It was a stance for mobility— he expected to do a lot of dodging. He picked out a path, lightly moving from rock to rock amidst the rubble, careful to step only where he was sure it was stable.

The beast hesitated. Whereas it had smelled prey, that prey now moved more like a predator than the easy meal it had hoped for. It had size on Ven, but that didn't always mean much here. It wouldn't be the first time it'd been forced to run away from some smaller, deadlier animal.

The beast widened its stance, not in a crouch, but more like it was bracing itself. Ven paused, uncertain. He had no idea what the animal was capable of, but it was yet too far for either of them to attack.

Long spines rose from either side along its back, where they'd hidden within its fur. They were thin, pale, almost translucent with a hint of blue and they formed a v-shape centered along its back.

Ven couldn't even guess at what they were for. They looked sharp and might make a decent defense against an aerial attack, but he was hardly going to jump up on the beast to impale himself. Still, not knowing made him nervous and he altered his course to head toward a large boulder only a dozen paces away.

The beast tracked him, keeping him lined up.

Sensing something amiss, Ven increased his pace.

The temperature began to drop rapidly. Then something glinted in the light between the rear most spines. Suspended between them, an ice crystal made of hard edges began to form.

Ven broke into a mad dash for the boulder as the crystal grew to about the size of a fist. Compared to the size of the beast, it was almost comically small, and yet he was absolutely certain he didn't want to be around when the animal finished whatever it was doing.

He was almost at the boulder when he felt a surge of graescence. Some people trained to sense the use of graescence but doing so could take years and Ven was not one of them. For him to have sensed it at all would have required a massive buildup.

In a panic, he leapt for the boulder... which exploded, knocking him back several paces mid jump. He hit the ground, rolled, and came back to his feet. He'd been knocked back by a large flat piece that had struck him in the chest. He could feel cuts on his face and arms, and he breathed deep, which only brought a mild ache. Nothing was broke, so he focused on the beast which was growing yet another ice crystal.

It'd taken, what, five seconds? Ven looked around but could find nothing large enough. What was left of his original boulder was split into two pieces too small for him to shelter behind. So instead, he sprint toward the beast, counting off the seconds as another ice crystal grew.

At five he dove into the ground. A concussive blast stole the air from his lungs. He felt the noise of it more than heard it.

He didn't waste time looking at whatever the crystal had destroyed. He just pushed himself back to his feet and continued his sprint toward the animal. It was still too far for him to reach it within five seconds, so as he counted out the fifth second, he once again dove, but this time angled away.

Another concussive blast assaulted him with shards of stone and dirt. The plume of it filled the air, and for a second Ven was hidden.

The beast faltered, eyes searching for the remains of its prey as the dust drifted away in the breeze. Ven emerged from the plume at a sprint, and the animal growled. The temperature dropped again, but then stopped as the beast realized it's quarry was closing too fast for it to unleash its attack again.

It's spines folded into its back as it lowered into a crouch. It launched at him and he dove, just barely avoiding extended claws that appeared to be made of the same material as the spines. He rolled to his feet and thrust his sword toward its paws. It hopped back, avoiding the attack easily.

The beast narrowed its eyes at the weapon, seeming wary of it. It swiped at him a couple times, tentatively testing, but Ven kept bringing the sword up and it would pull the swipe.

Ven cursed. He'd hoped the animal wouldn't recognize the danger. After all, it technically _was_ just a wooden sword, no matter how pretty. Yet its nearly invisible edge would cut through stone and flesh with ease, and Ven had hoped to remove a paw before the beast realized it. But whether the creature could sense the graescence or instictually realized the danger, it refused to get near the weapon.

The two danced around each other, Ven mostly thrusting for speed, while the animal swiped at him. Neither able to land a hit until the beast actually feinted an attack with its right paw. Ven again moved to block it with his sword while the other other paw flashed in much quicker.

Ven dropped to the ground as the beast's claw caught a glancing blow across his shoulder. He, in turn, scored the paw with the sword's tip as rolled.

The animal jumped back with a yelp, holding the paw up off the ground. Ven tried to push himself back up, but his shoulder felt stiff and slow. He glanced over at his shoulder and blinked hard. Only two of the claws had gotten him and while the lacerations weren't deep, they _were_ frozen solid, hard as ice.

He pushed himself up awkwardly and tried to raise his sword but the shoulder wouldn't let him.

"Dammit dammit _dammit_."

He switched to the weapon to his off hand while the ice beast crouched again to pounce. At that moment, a cloud flickered across the sun, casting a brief shadow. The beast's head jerked up while its ears went flat against its head, looking surprisingly like an terrified cat, albeit oversized one.

It jerked suddenly, yelping out screech of pain that surprised Ven. It twisted to snap at something behind it, and only then did Ven think of his sister, who'd spent the whole of the battle slowly sneaking up on the animal from behind.

He'd just assumed she would stay in the alcove. And why? He had no idea. She was easily as good a fighter as he was, if not better in some regards, but she'd been so far out of her element that... honestly, he didn't know what he'd expected of her and now was not the time to think on it.

He rushed in as the animal tried to hop away, but it couldn't move right. It's hind leg dragged. It whipped its head to snap at him, but he was already in a thrust, closer than it anticipated.

The animal jerked as it impaled its head on his sword. Ven jumped back before it could collapse on him.

And that was it. He stared at the dead animal in shock and disbelief. He hadn't really expected to come out this alive.

Meanwhile, Terra rounded the beast and approached her brother, who despite his dark skin was looking very pale. She herself felt shaky and weak as all the adrenaline from the last few minutes drained out of her.

She put her hand on his shoulder and flinched— it was hard and cold. Only then did she notice his wounds, frozen solid.

He jerked out of a daze and looked at her.

"I... do believe the rumours may have somewhat understated the dangers here."

Her brow shot up as she guffawed out an involuntary laugh. He too began laugh but it, like hers, was tinged with just a bit of hysteria.

They didn't get to laugh long. The mountains exploded with a sound that ranged from so deep it stole her breath, to a high pitched screech that hurt her ears.

They both fell to their knees, hands clamped over their ears. The sound went on and Terra began to wonder if sound could actually kill you.

Then, as suddenly as it came, the sound stopped.

Terra slowly removed her hands from her head and looked toward where the sound came from. What she saw then stole every shred of hope from her soul. She slumped, unable to comprehend the sight.

It looked like a dragon, something ripped out of the pages of an author's overactive imagination. It had every feature of one, with scales that seemed to shift between shades of stone gray and blue, a long snout, and horns that swept back from its head. And yet she was as certain that no author ever dreamt up a dragon so large and terrifying. How could they? What words would work; what paint could capture it? Her mind kept rejecting it, trying to resize the mountains around it because no living thing could possibly be that large.

The dragon spread its wings, seeming to consume the sky itself, and launched itself into the air.

It wasn't real. I couldn't be. A thing that large can't fly or, as it was, glide down. It shouldn't even be able to walk. It was just too large.

And yet it was almost elegant as it glided, seeming to grow larger as it descended.

They were going to die. It wasn't even a question, but for the first time Terra didn't really care. She'd seen myth come alive with a kind of wonder that beggared any experience before.

The dragon landed at least a hundred paces from them. Terra estimated it was the size of maybe a three story house? Larger? She just couldn't wrap her head around it. She was fairly certain she could casually _walk_ into its mouth.

The dragon casually regarded them, and the pressure of it staggered her. Terra's stomach churned as the world seemed to shift around her. She struggled to keep up right. Her brother's hand found hers, and they grasped, holding each other steady. The only time she'd ever felt anything like it was her first few times through a portal, and even that had been quick followed by recovery. This was an ongoing assault tore at her very sense of being.

Then it stopped.

Both siblings gasped and doubled over, panting as they tried to regain their breath. When they recovered, they found the dragon watching them, its head cocked in curiosity. It was an oddly human behavior. In its eyes were a depth of intelligence, but old and alien. Terra couldn't help but wonder how many empires this beast had witnessed... or perhaps just lived through— she doubted it cared much for the affairs of man.

Thrice, a deep thrumming caw-caw came from the dragon's throat. The sound was loud, resonating in her chest, but it didn't carry the sheer pain-inducing volume of its prior scream. It jerked its head rhythmically to the sound. Then it stopped, and waited. After a few seconds, it repeated the sound and motion.

"I... I do believe it's asking us to move," her brother said.

Terra looked over, feeling annoyed and disturbed that her brother would dare speak. But the words sunk in as the dragon made the same sounds again, a little more insistent.

"Of course," she looked behind her at the beast they killed. The pieces snapped together. "food."

"Yes, and I'd just as well not stand between it and... lunch, maybe?"

"Lets discuss semantics later."

"Wise as always," her brother said, his tone lilting up, shaken. He began slowly walking away, careful to make no sudden movements.

The dragon watched them go, still with a mild curiosity. After they'd gone a couple dozen paces, it moved in on its lunch. Terra wasn't sure what to expect from a dragon eating. If she'd had to guess, she would gone with it swallowing it's meal whole— it certainly could —or perhaps a whole lot of bloody tearing of flesh. What she would not have guessed was for it to take meticulous care in preparing its meal.

And yet, that's exactly what it did. It first sniffed the corpse, which was not so unusual as these things went, but then it carefully pinned the head down and pulled the body in the opposite direction. It paused, then suddenly the head detached, a perfectly clean cut. It discarded the head, casually flicking it away.

"It just... shaped... and edge," Terra said in awe.

Ven nodded slowly, eyes glued to the scene.

The dragon next clamped the cats tail down, and then ran a claw from the tail up the back, pulling up the spines and severing them all at the same time. It flipped the corpse over and repeated the process on the other side. It then cut off the paws and then finally the tail.

"I almost half expect it to skin and fillet the beast..." he frowned, leaning over. "Sister, you have the better senses here. What is it doing?"

To Ven, the dragon had sat back and was simply staring at its meal.

Terra's eyes had gone wide. "It's shaped a sphere around it but I... don't understand what it's..."

After a moment, Ven looked over. "Sister?" She didn't respond, but cocked her head. He poked her.

"What? Oh, uh. Well, it's almost like it's... ah," she exhaled, shaking her head, "it's percussing its own shape."

"Percussing?"

"Yeah," she turned to him, "if you take a metal bowl and tap on it, what happens to the sound?"

"It would reflect away from the bowl."

"Precisely. Except here it's contained within the sphere, and there are tens of thousands of taps all at once all bouncing around, a constant cacophony of intersecting graetic waves."

"To what point?"

She shrugged, turning back to watch. "I have no idea."

After Terra had gotten over the idea of an animal using graescence at all, much less actual shaping, she settled down to "watch" what it was doing. Though she'd trained, Terra wasn't particularly talented at sensing graescence. There were people who could "see" the world, eyes closed, using only their graescence talents to sense the world around them, but getting to that level took years of effort. Someone like that could have told her exactly what the dragon was doing. As it was, she could tell _that_ the dragon was percussing its sphere, but not how. More importantly, she couldn't understand what it was supposed to accomplish. As far as she could tell, all it was doing was creating a whole lot of graetic noise.

"Look at the air..."

Terra squeezed here eyes shut for a moment and blinked a few times to shift her perspective. The air was wavy and distorted, seeming to flow within the sphere. Her breath caught as she realized what the dragon was doing.

She leaned forward. "Gods, is it..."

Her brother nodded. "I do think so."

"Huh."

"Yep."

She tore her eyes from the scene. "Perhaps we should run before it decides to cook us?"

"Run _where_?" he laughed. "I cannot think of a place safe from that thing."

"A cave?"

"Ah yes a cave, of course. Or in this case, perhaps we should call it an oven instead."

"A... deep cave?"

"Do you know of one?" He shook his head, turning serious. "Besides, running could well mark us as prey or food. As it stands, I believe it would have killed us already had it designs for us as a snack."

"You believe?"

"Perhaps we should call it desperate hope? But at least this should take some time. A beast that large will not cook quickly."

"No, it's not just heating the air. Everything within the sphere is—" Her head jerked back as she sensed a dramatic shift in graescence.

"Sister?"

"It's formed another sphere, sheltering its meal for some rea— woah."

The percussion increased dramatically. Perhaps percussion was the wrong word. More like, the dragon had set off a thousand bombs within it's own sphere. Ven didn't need senses to understand what had happened. An explosion of fire swirled around within the sphere, causing both of them to flinch back from the heat.

"Oh shit, down!"

Terra dove for the dirt and curled up into a ball, arms wrapped around her head. Ven wasted half a second in confusion before following suit. He saw the ball of flame expand out rapidly just as dove into the ground. He was just a tad late as the flame hit is face just as he was burying it.

A brief flash of heat washed over them.

They carefully peeked up, then sat up once they realized it was over. The dragon hadn't moved, apparently unbothered by the explosion that removed Ven's eyebrows and done horrific things to Terra's hair. In front of it, though, was what amounted to an oversized, roasted cat. The dragon had managed to burn off the hair and crisp fry the skin all at once. Terra had no doubt the meat inside was equally well done.

Then the smell wafted over them.

"Oh gods, that smells good," Ven groaned.

Terra's stomach growled, forcibly reminding her they'd barely eaten all day.

"Do you think it might leave us some? I _did_ kill it after all."

Terra's eyes flashed. "You?"

"Ah, we killed it?"

Terra rolled her eyes and huffed, turning back to watch the dragon.

"Men," she growled.

Ven turned to her. "Forgive my lapse, please. Without you I would have struggled quite severely to—"

"_You_ would be dead."

He sighed, hesitated, "Yes."

The dragon had walked over to it's meal and was sniffing it. It let out a low, thrumming that Terra could only think of as a cooing sound. The siblings flinched as it lashed out and snatched the meal into its mouth faster than they could blink. It did not swallow the meal whole, though, but chewed slowly, crunching with ease both bone and flesh. When it was done, it sniffed around the area and then, satisfied, turned its attention to the siblings.

Terra found it hard to breath. The dragon regarded them for just a moment, then let out two deep caw-caw's. It turned away from them, spread its wings, and launched itself into the air. She watched with mild envy the ease with which the dragon ascended, before disappearing over a distant ridge. The pair sat in silence, just staring at the horizon.

Her brother was first to break it. "I do believe that was a thank you."

Terra turned to him. He'd sounded ruminant. "Your thoughts?"

"This is its territory," he frowned, staring at the ground, "and our ice-cat was as much hiding from it as much as it was seeking prey."

"So?"

"Yet I believe it has accepted our presence," he turned toward her, "and so this may, in truth, be the safest place for us."

Her brow shot up. "You wish to stay here? Are you mad?"

He nodded, brow raised. "Quite so, but think on it. All the larger predators will avoid the dragon's territory—"

"Larger? You think your ice-cat was not large enough? There must be larger monsters to hunt us?"

"Well," he said glancing back toward where they last saw the dragon, "oddly, I do."

Terra huffed out a low growl and closed her eyes. "You would make this hell our home."

He reached out, took her hand, and spoke quietly. "I would. I know it's not ideal, sis, but winter has only just begun. We will not survive it without shelter, and to travel will ensure only our death."

"You would have us starve or freeze to death in a cave instead?"

"No. I— _we_ —will work together, find shelter, scout the area, find food. And once spring returns we will make our way home. Terraria Van Belcia, we. will. live. This I promise you."

His declaration enraged her. "Tell me, then, from what spring arises such unfounded confidence? We will die here, yet your manner is one on a holiday, admiring the view. You are happy, brother, _happy here_ of all places. Nothing of it makes sense. It... just... No! _Explain yourself._"

He looked taken aback by her outburst. He stared at her for a few seconds, then his expression softened.

"You know I hunt—"

She snorted.

"—and I do not mean the guided entertainment those overdressed fops like to—"

"Fops! A true insult from you."

He took a breath. "We would go out weeks, or sometimes months at a time and just... survive. We took no tools we could not fit in our pack and yes, we hunted, but for food, not sport."

"Who is this we? I can think of none who would debase themselves to merest survival."

"Of course not. None you know or, perhaps, none you realize. At least, not any more than you suspected me."

"Yes, because you have lied, and to your own family, hiding your true self, presenting a... facade. You are not worthy to be Van."

He nodded slowly. "I am not. Nor I was ever intended for the Chair. You were."

"Yet your are Van," she hissed, "and that is no thing you simply walk away from. You disgrace mother and court death. You _know_ what she will—"

"Or perhaps you do not know our mother quite so well as you pretend."

She stared at him as he stood.

"What are you not saying?"

"We will make for the valley," he said, words clipped, "but first the dragon has done us a service, I believe."

"A what?"

He walked away toward there the ice-cat had died. She closed her eyes and stuffed her anger into a box with practiced efficiency. Then she rose, and followed him.

He first examined the removed spines. They'd been within the sphere but looked unharmed. The fire had even cleaned them. And they were sharp. He picked them up and began putting them in his pack with the sharp points sticking out. They were as long as his arm, so quite a bit of length stuck out of his pack.

He next examined the skull and then, to her horror, took out his knife and carefully cut into it.

"Is that truly necessary?"

He nodded, "You'll learn quick to use everything you can."

In just a few minutes, he'd removed most of the teeth. Though a couple were damaged, the large canines were intact. She sighed silently when he moved on to the paws to extract the thing's claws. She couldn't imagine what they'd use them for, but then she'd never been forced to survive before and he, apparently, had.

Once done, he walked off toward the valley without a word.
