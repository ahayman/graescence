# 38 | Midnight [Roland]

Roland ran through a black night illuminated only by the occasional stretch of starlight peeking through the forest canopy.

Beneath him, the darkness rose up with grasping tendrils to tear his skin. His breath was ragged, arms raised in defense, bloody from the tendrils. He ran and tripped and stumbled, falling only to rise again in desperate haste.

From behind a series of yips penetrated the panicked haze of his mind.

Adrenaline surged through him and brought sharp awareness. He ran faster with the knowledge that every broken branch, every crash, every loud, thundering step he took only drew them nearer.

Again the yips came, closer but spread out, taunting with high pitches.

Panic became a cold pressure in his chest and a hot coal in his stomach. He didn't even know what they were, but their tone set a chill through his spine. The yips had high tones, laughing, mocking, calling, taunting— they promised pain and death in shrill sounds.

He was being hunted.

He changed course randomly in hopes of throwing them off, though he knew it was futile. He stumbled again and ran headlong into a thick bush. The sound of broken branches echoed through his head and tore at his body. He half crawled, half pulled himself through the bush and over.

The taunts came again, closer, from just behind, close enough to to nip his heels.

He pushed into his legs all that fear and panic for every ounce of speed he could muster. He glanced back but saw only the darkness. The yips breathed down his neck, but he couldn't see them.

A sudden shower of light filled his vision in a display that left him breathless. He registered a distant thud that seemed to shatter the stars themselves. Nothing made sense. The world had shifted so that down pulled at his back. He watched flecks of light slowly fade into the darkness. He breathed heavy, gasping breaths and tried to remember where he was, who he was, and why he was on his back.

The tendrils of darkness were faintly illuminated by a distant orange light. Ionia. It had risen to cast the world in a sand-colored tapestry of faint, low-angled oranges that shattered the night into a spiderweb of tinted cracks. It felt like a long time until he understood what he was looking at. A dead tree had left the stars exposed, the night cracked between. It was beautiful. It was silent.

It was silent.

He sat up and moaned at the pounding drums that echoed in his head. He reached and felt a tender knot on his forehead that throbbed to the rhythm of a burgeoning headache.

Why was it silent? Where were the yips?

He got up and stumbled when dizziness overtook him. He should be dead, yet he heard nothing now but a light ringing in his ears.

Where were the yips? Had they given up, or were they watching him, waiting for the chase to resume?

A cold dread spread through his limbs. They _wanted_ him to flee. They yearned for a chase and they were patient, willing to give him whatever time he needed to resume flight.

No, not whatever time: only enough time. He had no doubt that to stand still, alone in the middle of the night, would earn him death quicker than any chase ever could.

He ran.

A flurry of excited yips confirmed his suspicions. They were close, but not too close. They'd waited for him; they waited for the hunt to resume.

He stumbled as the ground tilted upward and forced him onto his hands to half climb, half crawl up a steep slope. Some ways up he slipped and struck his knee on a rock that had turned underfoot. The stone scraped a line up his torso as he slid through the half-rotten detritus. He reached and grasped until his fingers wrapped some half-moist root that bit deeply into his skin. He pulled on it hard, arrested his slide, and began to climb up again as his boots slid and sought purchase in the mud. Through some miracle wrought of desperation and panic, he gained elevation.

The yips separated into two groups that slowly gained on his left and right flanks until they were parallel to him. Yet while they kept with his ascent, they ventured no closer.

Why didn't they kill him?

They yipped and taunted, drove fear like a finely honed weapon, his struggles the punchlines to their entertainment. But they refused the kill.

His body was bruised, scratched, and beaten, and most of that had not been from tonight. He no longer knew where each wound came from, nor how long it'd been there, so many layered that his whole body seemed untouched by pain. The pain had become a background chorus that seemed to swell and subside, a constant companion to each day. It was a chorus he'd become used to, if that were possible, by simply accepting it as part of his existence. Yet for all that, he was easy prey; he was weak.

Why didn't they attack?

His hand grasped a thick, dry root. He stopped his climb and let himself half dangle, half rest against the forest loam.

"Attack you cowards!" he screamed.

Silence answered him.

A bitter laugh escaped his lips. It was absurd. He'd spent his days attacking Rose just so that she wouldn't attack him. Yet now he longed to be attacked, if only to resolve the utter stupidity this night had become. He didn't even know what he was running from.

A crack broke the night's unnatural silence. Roland reigned in his breath; he listened.

A scratch, then the patter of paws, then silence.

A warning. They were close; they were watching.

Adrenaline surged through his body; his heart raced. Roland flipped himself over and began clawing his way up the mountain.

The yips came again, excited, taunting. Their patience was cruel. It could have been mere minutes, but it left like hours, lifetimes spent in fear and panic that subsided and renewed in turn by the taunting yip.

He hated those yips, yet he obeyed them. Just like he did her. He hated himself for it but the promise of pain, of death itself, proved too much motivation. And so without thought, he tore up his body to comply.

A misplaced hand found a false hold that left him tottering backward, arms splayed out, hands suddenly empty of purchase. That moment froze in the very instant of realization that all the world had truly moved beyond his control. The feeling of the helpless burned into his mind. Then the moment fled, having delivered its judgement: he would die now.

He rolled uncontrolled down the mountain. At first, he flung his arms out to grab anything that might help him stop, but his speed continued to increase until it was impossible to grab anything. Then he felt his arm slam into a tree with a loud crack. He pulled in his arms to protect the broken limb, but this only made him roll faster down the hill until the light of Ionia bled into the ground in a streaked blur of orange and black.

A single tree spelled death, and as attractive as that was, his mind began discussing the merits of sacrificing limbs to slow down. It never reached a consensus nor he muster enough bravery, before the ground leveled out to resolve the issue. In the end, he arrested his roll with an outstretched arm. It twisted back painfully, but not quite enough to tear. He lay there for a moment, face down, breath mingling with dirt.

He'd just managed to fall down an incline in minutes what had taken him an eternity to climb. He wanted to laugh and scream at the universe, the sheer unfairness of it all, the comic absurdity that had become his life.

He rolled over and peered through a gap in the canopy. Ionia was so pretty, so big. What would it be like to die here with her as his last vision?

Maybe not too bad, but he didn't want to die.

Why? Why couldn't he want do die? It would be so much easier to just give up, let himself be eaten. Surely the pain wouldn't be so bad, not compared to everything else. So why was he desperately tempted to go back to her?

No. He repeated the word over and over until it became a litany, a chant, a curse. He'll never go back to that.

But neither could he die.

The yips came again, angry and distant.

He chuckled at the bitter irony. He'd left them high up the mountain, and now they must scramble down carefully the same slope he'd barely survived.

He wanted to lay there and sink into the night, but his arm throbbed. It was broken, and he knew it would be only a few minutes before the pain would eat at his mind. He lifted his arm up and tried to look at it in the moon's light. Only the outline was visible, but it was too big, swollen and twisted, maybe. Would Rose simply kill him if he became useless, cripple? Was it worth it?

No. He wouldn't die. Not here, not like this.

He got up and stumbled as a shock of pain pulsated up his arm. He tried to think, to be smart. Rose had frequently harped on being smart, on using his head as more than just a rock to beat on.

To run away from the mountain was to run back to her. Up was toward the yips, which left two directions. He needed to lose the yips, so he chose the way that looked easier. Maybe he could lose them if he moved quickly enough. It was a foolish chance but one better than certain death, so he took it.

It was much harder to run with a broken arm. His balance was off, and he kept lilting to the side, often stumbling over nothing. More than once, he slammed himself against a tree to arrest some stumble verging on a fall, and every time it flooded fresh pain through his mind, brightening the night.

But no, it was not the pain that brightened the world. The world was actually getting brighter. Ionia had increased her assault against the darkness enough that he could make out more of the forest floor. This more than anything helped prevent some misplaced foot from tripping him up.

The yips came again, curious and confused. Was it odd to think he recognized the meaning behind their strange, almost light-hearted little noises? Perhaps he was reading too much into it. Perhaps he was hypersensitive to the sound of the beasts that hunted him. They must have reached the base of the mountain, but not found where he landed. Maybe they wouldn't catch his trail. That felt like hope, and the cynic knew it for a lie.

Nevertheless, he slowed down to pay more attention to the sounds he made. He didn't know if that was how they tracked him, but he didn't want to give them anything. So he carefully picked his way from rocks and boulders to roots, anything he thought would make less noise.

His heart fell as more yips sounded. They were happy and excited, but it was too soon for them to find his landing. He hadn't gone far enough. Could they track him from there? If he could just keep his distance, stay quiet, and move quickly, maybe— he shook his head in frustration. That was stupid. Of course they could follow him.

He broke into a run, jumped between the rocks, and tried to tip-toe through the rest. It was a mistake. The light had tricked him. The rock looked flat, but as he landed, he felt his ankle twist, and he cried out as his foot tried to fold up under him. He hit his shoulder hard, which sent a jarring pain through the broken arm.

He tried to get up as tears worked their way down his face. They were too close, their yips almost on him already.

It was impossible, or had they always been that fast? Of course, now that he offered no sport anymore, they'd finish it quickly.

That sounded nice to end it all, and he felt an odd sense of relief. It felt freeing to face his fear and accept the inevitable. Running had only fueled the panic and terror. Now all that was left was to face death. At least he would be done with it all.

He looked around through his tears for any safe place he could hide. There was none, of course, because why would there be? He could not run nor even walk far on his ankle. So instead, he limped over to a large tree and leaned his back against it. If he were going to face death, he would face it head-on.

They sounded from all around him in excited and eager tones, but for all the noise, he couldn't see a single one. Maybe they weren't real? Maybe all they did was create fear, the forest's dark idea of a joke, and some cute little furry thing will come out and nuzzle him in good humor. Maybe he'd run away from a ghost, torn up his body for nothing but jest.

Was he even sane any more? Did it matter? He chuckled, then laughed. It felt good.

A flicker of motion drew his eyes to a spot as a creature slowly stalked into view. His face blanched, color drained, breath short and quick.

Oh, it had fur, but it was not cute, and its fangs implied cuddling was out of the question. It was both smaller and bigger than he'd expected. Bigger than the yips suggested, smaller than his imagination had grown them into. It was a dog or some twisted cousin. It wore a mottled brown and black fur, hackles raised, baring teeth he thought were longer than they needed to be. He could see obsidian colored claws pierce the ground, barely glinting orange in the moon's light. They looked sharp.

The beast was growling a low noise he felt in his chest. The reverberation of it filled him, rattled his bones; it was nothing like the yips he heard.

Roland suddenly did not want to die.

No matter the pain, no matter the struggle, he wanted to live. It was a startling reversal, to so willingly accept death only to find a new love for life.

And with that love came hate. He hated feeling powerless. He hated these creatures that had chased and taunted him. He hated Rose, who had beat him repeatedly in some twisted idea of training. He hated Rose, who kept him here, trapped in a place with no walls and nowhere to run. He hated Rose, who lorded over him both food and sleep, who called him weak.

He hated himself for being weak.

The idea of succumbing meekly filled him with disgust. He wanted nothing more than to reach out and crush these creatures. He recalled how easily Rose had pinned him down that first day with nothing but her mind. She'd told him he was a monster, he was the hunted. But monsters are the hunters, they kill, and they're powerful. He would be that monster. He reached deep inside himself and then focused hard on the beast before him, pouring all that hate into a single moment while he _squeezed._

Nothing happened.

His anger evaporated into panic. His eyes darted around for a stick or rock, anything he could use to defend himself. The only thing he found was sitting behind the beast, which approached him slowly. It was a large stick, and if he could just get to it, maybe he could defend himself.

It was a fool's hope, a stupid gambit, and he sprinted toward the beast before he could think it through.

He almost collapsed under the searing pain of his ankle. He stumbled and pushed through, and only managed to grasp the stick as his ankle gave out and the beast jumped to the side, taken off guard by the irrational maneuver.

He grasped the stick like a drowning man would a raft, and used it to stand up slowly. He felt like a fool as he held out his stick against the beast, balanced on one foot, the other barely touching the ground. He felt far more exposed without a tree to guard his back.

Yip, said the alpha, then resumed its low growl.

Yip, Yip, the rest replied in a single chorus. They sounded many and came from everywhere at once.

Roland waved his stick around in threatening gestures as he began to slowly limp his way back to the tree. The alpha looked at him curiously but did nothing more.

A tearing pain seared across his back and the alpha was joined by another.

Roland cried out but continued to limp backward toward the tree. It was just like training. He could ignore the pain, push through it, make it to the tree.

That's it, just make it to the tree.

He caught a sound this time and turned to swipe, but the animal came in low and tore into his leg with its claws. He missed it with a wild swing that unbalanced himself enough to fall. He used his stick again to push himself up to stand. At least it had been useful for something.

The second one joined the other two as he continued to limp his way toward the tree. The beast had torn his good leg and reduced his progress to little more than a shuffle. The tree seemed so far away now.

A tear across his stomach, this one deep enough to draw blood but not enough to gut him. He hadn't even heard that one coming, and only registered the pain after the third one joined the others. They stared at him, patient, quiet, curious. He was a spectacle, a joke, and they were betting. How long could the stupid, weak boy last? How much could he take?

It was hopeless, yet he continued to limp. It was just like his training with Rose. No matter how he tried, he couldn't hit them, touch them, or even defend himself.

A tear across his other leg and he dropped to his knees. He wasn't going to make it. They wouldn't let him. Give him just enough hope and tear it way, just enough to hang himself, just beyond reach, just beyond touch. Just enough to reach, never enough to grasp.

He grasped and search his mind for the 'thing' he'd latched onto that day forever ago. He had power, a monster inside him. It was there, he knew it, but he didn't know where, or what, or how.

Another slash seared across his back.

He cried out and then ignored it as he sought whatever it was that gave him power.

Something tickled his mind. He grabbed at it, but it slipped away, like pulling on a rope made of water. As soon as he squeezed, it would just gush through his fingers. He grabbed at it, pulled, pushed, yanked, anything to get it to do something. Nothing worked.

He heard a rustle, felt something tear at his arm, and he screamed. He pulled all his rage into one single thought and _pushed_.

A massive wave of destruction pulsed out from him and scattered leaves, branches, and rocks before a rolling flood of power. He heard large rocks clash against the forest floor, followed by the loud crack of a tree breaking in two. Then silence.

Relief flooded him, and he chuckled. His voice sounded loud in his ears, but he didn't care. He'd done it. He'd—

They were still there.

His heart jumped, then stayed there. They hadn't moved. Just like _her_, they hadn't moved. Everything around had been demolished in an arc of destruction, him the epicenter. Yet for all that, they stood there and stared as though he'd done nothing at all. Terror wrapped itself around his heart.

They all attacked at once.

He flung his hands over his face and felt their needled teeth tear into his flesh. He curled in as they pulled on his arms and legs to expose what he desperately needed to protect. At first the pain was intense, yet it soon lost meaning under the strain of keeping himself together. Before long the only thing that mattered was keeping them from their goal as they alternated between pulling limbs and snarling teeth that pressed in between the cracks.

A loud crack thundered through the night, followed by a yelp. The sound shocked him, but he refused to look up and expose his face. Another crack and he felt pressure lift from his leg. The beast on his arm let go next with a yelp of pain. More cracks and yelps were followed either by thuds or the sound of running until there was no pressure left.

He didn't move. He didn't want to know. He was curled up in pain, bloody and tired, as he lay on the floor of the forest and try to understand why he was blinded by light. He then heard the voice he'd dreaded all night long.

“Jackrets, like most beasts in this forest, use gravics. They're vile, cowardly little creatures that hunt in packs, and would have long ago died out if not for the shields they can generate. They're smart, though, and only hunt weaker prey, but they're quite easy to kill, with proper training of course.”

She lectured him? He couldn't believe she was just lecturing him, like this had been nothing more than one of their morning training sessions, him on the ground bloody as she explained what he did wrong.

A vast pit opened up in his stomach.

Had he run away, only to find himself torn apart in some sadistic training scenario? Her voice betrayed no surprise, no anger, nothing except the pragmatic tone she always used, the only tone he suspected she ever used. Remove the night and the blood, her tone well could be placed as little more than simple instruction.

His breath left him. She'd been here the whole time. She allowed him to run, to desperately try to outmaneuver the Jackets, and watched him fight for his life, even to the point where they'd ripped his flesh open over and over.

His hands clenched in rage. She'd watched it; she'd watched it all.

"Would you like proper training?" It hardly felt like a question.

His hands ached as nails drew blood from his palms. She was manipulating him and it was working. He desperately wanted training now and he wanted power. His hate had settled on a target, and it was his weakness.

He got up and felt his anger and rage solidify into a solid, tangible determination. It would fuel him, drive him. He would train, and he would win.

"Good. You will walk home. I will not carry you, but perhaps I can teach you to bandage yourself when you arrive."

She paused for a moment, and Roland looked up to see the light for the first time. It looked like a gravic lamp, with the same steady blue-white light, but it was simply suspended over her hand, no lamp in sight. He wanted to ask how but knew she wouldn't respond. She only answered questions about the training or task at hand. Instead, he nodded, though his eyes burned.

She pointed away from the mountain. "Home is that way."

The light disappeared and she was gone. All that remained was the dark mounds of dead Jackrets scattered about.

His eyes adjusted to the renewed dark, a dark he no longer feared. And why should he? The training was over except for the walk home, and that would be enough in his state.

He looked back toward the mountain and briefly entertained the idea of running again. He wouldn't, of course. He had no idea what was on the other side, nor what kind of beasts might roam there. The idea of running seemed ridiculous now, even if he didn't have enough wounds to kill him before he left the valley.

He hadn't even left the valley.

How many more valleys and mountains were between him and the nearest town? Where even was the nearest town? Even in Larstead, with the nearest town dozens of leagues away, he could spy their light reflected off the clouds in the distance. Here it was all black, no reflection, no glow, nothing.

Running was a stupid idea; it always had been. There was nothing to run to. But even if there were, he no longer wanted to run. He wanted to train.

He was weak and pathetic. He got that now. How could he be a champion like this? How could he defend others when he couldn't even defend himself?

Rose was brutal, but she had to be. He'd been blind and stupid to think that it would be easy to become a champion. Because Sal had been right: there were no champions anymore. There were only cruel soldiers, uncaring Royals, and ugly beasts looking to prey on the weak.

And so Roland made his decision as his blood fed the forest floor. He would become strong and he would become that champion no matter what it took.

He began the slow, painful walk home. His ankle hurt the most, at least at first. Eventually, it died down into a constant throb he pressed into the back of his mind. His skin tightened as blood scabbed over the numerous gashes until they tore open when he moved wrong, only to scab over again. If he walked carefully, he could keep the scabs on his torso from reopening, but there was nothing he could do about his legs. He could feel the blood drip down and tickle his skin before it sank into the forest floor.

It took him over an hour to walk home, and by the time he arrived, he was light-headed enough that his many pains had become distant, almost dream-like. He was probably dying but found it difficult to care. The temptation to sit and let death take him was an insistent desire, and only the rage-filled coal in his stomach gave him the determination to stumble into the house, where he promptly collapsed.

Rose kept her promise. She gave him drink to open his eyes. She showed him how to set a broken bone, and after demonstrating the technique, made him do it to himself. It was painful and sharp but quick, followed by an ache that faded into the background. He managed it on his first try, and for the first time he could recall, she gave him praise. He was so shocked that he promptly forgot the pain, if only for a moment.

She then explained how to create a caste, using cloth and paste that would harden. She showed him how to scrub out the wounds, a torment all its own, but one he endured willingly. She showed him the proper antiseptic to use in cleaning, what salves would numb, and what ointments were good for healing.

He required many stitches. Those he could reach, she made him do himself. He was numbed, of course, so that he could do it with a steady hand. She praised his stitches, and despite his every instinct, every wall, every warning thrown from his mind, it still made him feel good. He couldn't reach the gashes on his back, so she did those herself. But she was not mean in her administrations, almost delicate in the way she worked. When they were done, she showed him how to wrap the wounds so they would heal properly.

When they finished, she gave him a sweet, pasty drink that she claimed would help him recover from blood loss. He drank it all with gratitude that leaked unease into his stomach.

"You did well."

She smiled at him then, a genuine, almost motherly thing that churned his stomach.

He didn't need her kindness; he didn't need her compassion. He needed to become strong.

"Tomorrow we train," he said. Then he got up without looking at her and went to bed.
