# 47 | The Daughters of Hontima [Sal]

"They only have access to Castel and Andriel," Ash said as she sat down across the table, more straddling her chair than sitting in it.

"Castel?"

"Mmm hmm..." she reached out and picked out some meat from a large dish in the center of the table. She ripped off a chunk and chewed while the rest of it dangled in her hand.

"Castel would be quicker," Djrek mused. "Direct access to the capital; we'd be there within a day or two."

Her meat waved around in agreement. "It would."

"Andriel, then?"

"It's the only reasonable option."

"Agreed."

Ash grunted and popped the rest of the meat into her mouth even though she hadn't yet swallowed the first bite. She grabbed a larger piece from the plate as she rose from the chair.

"Be back in a bit," she said through the food in her mouth and walked off.

Sal frowned as he finished chewing. "Did she do that purpose?"

"Do what?"

"Be. Back. Bit."

Djrek's eyebrows went up. "You are a very odd boy."

Sal shrugged and returned his attention to his meal, which consisted of chewy flat bread stacked up on a plate and a sweet sauce placed in a small, polished wooden bowl on the side. Djrek wrapped the meat with the flat-bread and dipped it in the jelly. It was the proper to way to eat it but Sal just couldn't do it. Instead, he stabbed a piece of meat, transferred it to his plate, cut off a piece from it and the bread, and used his fork to dip them both in the sauce.

As far as Sal could tell, the Inquisitor's diet consisted of long stretches of bland rations punctuated by what he could only describe as gourmet cuisine— yet another term he'd pilfered from a book. This one he'd exchanged with a merchant they'd been travelling with. The merchant was probably still unaware of the trade, but Sal had been fair. In exchange for a book on hotels, Sal had given the woman what he was certain had to be a compelling love story about some runaway princess who found true love with a farm boy. The story itself seemed outlandish and frequently interrupted itself with long descriptions of the body's anatomy, but at least it had taught him a few new words.

The book he'd received was much better, as it was entirely about the many evils of hotels. The book's author sought to reveal how hotels often took simple peasant recipes and redressed them to be served up to the Royals as 'cuisine'. It was for this reason that the whole hotel concept was destined to fail.

The irony of the book's premise was expounded in considerable detail by a forward added to it's fourth reprint. In an effort to expose the truth, the author had done exhaustive research into the recipes themselves, apparently intent on showing exactly how this newly budding 'Hotel Concept' was ripping of the peasants. That exposition ended up serving as a blueprint for other entrepreneurs to use, right down the very recipes themselves, many of which could now be found in most hotels. The author, in his attempt to discredit the hotel industry, ended up fueling its rise.

According to the author, the Castilian was one of the worst offenders; according to the editor, it is now one of the oldest and most prestigious hotels in the Santonian province. It resided on the northern tip of Hontima, a large trade city split by the Langrese river, which connected Castel in the south to the northern cities. Hontima was rich off the constant trade moving between the north and south, and the hotel took every advantage. Shaped as a white, twisting stone pyramid with its top sheared off and rising a full twenty stories, the hotel was designed to replicate the feel of Castel's spires, ostensibly to make the Royals feel at home. The owners of the Castilian had purchased the land surrounded the hotel and turned it into a sprawling garden divided into sections that could be rented out. Not only was this an extra source of income, it kept the view clear for the hotel's many, many balconies.

Sal stared out over the railing of the sixteenth floor balcony while he ate. Beyond was an endless sea of grass, the Santonian plains. He knew very little of them except that they were vast; it was a subject he hoped to remedy with another 'trade' if he could find one. Behind him, on the other side of the hotel, were supposed to be views of the foothills and, at least for the upper balconies, glimpses of the mountains beyond.

Their balcony had maybe a dozen tables, with perhaps only half occupied. Heating elements had been strategically placed between the tables, providing just enough heat to keep the chill of autumn off the guests. Occasionally, a pusher would weave through the tables and top off the heaters.

"Why not Castel?" Sal kept his tone as casual as possible. He stabbed another piece of meat and cut it slowly.

"Too risky."

Sal grimaced. Extracting information from Djrek had proven to be infuriatingly difficult. Direct questions about why they were going to see the Emperor were ignored, but he often could garner clues from indirect questions. In fact, he'd become certain that this is exactly what Djrek expected him to do: use clues to piece together the truth.

"The Royals?"

"Hmmm..." Djrek dipped his breakfast in the sauce and chewed, looking south over the railing.

Not exactly a ringing endorsement, but also not an objection. More likely, Sal had gotten a little right, a little wrong.

"Not from the Royals then? Or no, not just from the Royals... from someone else?"

A smile tugged at Djrek's lips, but his gaze didn't move.

"Or the problem is we don't know. There are other places exporting Elderin—" Djrek's lips twitched down. Right, it wasn't the Elderin that was the problem; that much he'd already figured out.

Sal spent six seconds thinking. "There are other _towns_ in the project, and we don't know how many."

Nothing from Djrek; Sal barrelled on.

"Castel is not one the towns, _buuuut_ whoever is controlling these projects is probably doing it from there. And because we don't know who or how many, it's a risk?"

Djrek broke off his gaze to look at Sal, one eyebrow raised.

"You think they'd attack us, Inquisitors?" Sal asked, a bit uncertain.

"You are not an Inquisitor quite yet."

Sal pinched his lips, earning a chuckle from Djrek.

"But you think they'd attack us, really?"

Djrek put down his rolled meat, still dripping from the sauce. "I think the only real evidence of this conspiracy is a young boy that, should he somehow disappear... then..." He spread his arms out and shrugged.

"Kill me!? But... but you know as much as I do, more even."

Djrek lowered his arms and leaned back. "I have enough clout to get one or two investigations going, perhaps three with Ash behind me, but they would fizzle out quick enough without any real evidence."

Sal frowned and picked at his food. Djrek's explanation almost made perfect sense, and that troubled him. He'd offered the information too quickly, latching on to something Sal had proffered without actually confirming it. He made it easy for Sal to accept his own explanation, and if there's one thing he'd learned under Djrek, it was that the most suspicious of all ideas always came from within.

Never assume that just because something makes sense, it must therefore be true.

So what assumptions was he making? Both Ash and Djrek agreed that going to Castel would be quicker than Andriel, and that was a reason to go to Andriel. Djrek had clarified that Castel was too risky when asked.

Risk. Sal turned the world over in his head. Why was it riskier to go the quicker way?

Djrek stood, causing the chair to screech back. "I think it's time for you to walk through your first gate."

Sal rose quickly, his food forgotten, and followed Djrek into the hotel while his mind chewed on a different kind of meal.

They found Ash waiting in the hotel lobby, a massive three story space encompassing most of the ground floor. Tastefully arranged fountains dotted the interior, lined by benches facing outward and rimmed by wide-leafed plants that Sal was certain didn't grow this far north. Large panes of glass, extending the full three stories over doubled doors, let in the morning light from the eastern side. Beyond could be seen the wide sidewalk that lined this side of the river. On the opposite side were tall trees and precisely manicured bushes. A stone bridge with an ornate railing, squares within squares, arched over the river just north of the hotel entrance, close enough to be part of the view without blocking sight of the garden.

Sal had stopped three steps in the door when they arrived. He had read about the hotel, of course, but whatever images he'd conjured in his head hadn't done the place justice. He was a too small boy coming from a too small town to have imagined a space this big. This time, though, Sal didn't stop, finding himself fully capable of gawking while walking in a mostly straight line.

Ash led them out of the lobby and turned south down a spotless sidewalk. The sidewalk soon turned into a proper road as they walked by stone buildings, most decorated with the same square-within-square design. Aside from the white-painted hotel, the rest of the city seemed to be made out of the same grey stone. Despite the late morning, there were still a number of people about, most wearing thicker wraps against the chill, and all walking with purpose. They were all very conscious to avoid the black dressed pair with their oddly peasant-looking charge.

Sal shivered a little from the chill. "Is there a local quarry nearby?"

Djrek arced an eyebrow and looked over at Sal askance without slowing his pace.

"Everything is made out of stone here."

Djrek tilted his head and considered Sal for four seconds, just enough for him to grow suspicious, then nodded.

"About an hour east, the Hontima family discovered the foothills were rich in granite and began exporting it. This was over a thousand years ago, of course, about the time the Empire began restricting Elderin and builders were looking for alternative materials."

"They made a lot money then."

"He did and then he lost it."

"...how?"

Drjek's lip twitched up, just barely, but enough to for Sal's suspicion to firm. He waited, sensing a story; Djrek liked to tell stories.

"He had only daughters and a lot of money."

Sal waited eleven seconds. "Okay... so your saying the daughters spent all his money?"

"No. Well..." Djrek reached up and rubbed his cheek, "maybe they squandered it."

More silence. Djrek appeared to be watching people.

Thirteen seconds before Sal's annoyance leaked out again. "_How?_"

"Well, let's just say he lacked a certain political acumen, and perhaps even a naïveté concerning men, oddly enough. It led to blood."

Sal looked over, startled. "Blood?" That hadn't been the direction he was expecting.

Also, naïveté? He'd need to look that one up, but the context gave him enough. Neat word, though; it sounded nice.

"Mmm hmm. He was a generous man, one of the good ones. He sold the granite to local businesses at cost and kept the taxes light. The city's growth exploded, bringing in more business until even those light taxes made up a considerable revenue stream. He took that money and began a series of public works: sanitation, roads, parks, statues..." he snorted, "even a library—"

Sal's head jerked. "Wait, a library?" Maybe he could trade his book.

"—though I'm not sure what he thought would happen. The library didn't last long. Most Royals have their own collections and most citizens can't actually read."

Sal sighed as Djrek trailed off. He'd long realized that his literacy was odd, but he'd written it off as a side effect of whatever experiment his town had been. The bigger problem was Djrek liked to tell stories, but he also liked to answer questions with stories that did not actually answer the question or, if they did, you had to work for it.

He also wouldn't finish the story unless you worked for it, an irritating habit.

"So he was generous."

"He was."

"And that made him rich."

"Exceedingly."

"But he lost it, and it was bloody because... he was bad at politics and had only daughters?"

Djrek has slowed his pace and folded his arms behind him. He looked around at the buildings but said nothing. Ash had just about disappeared into the morning crowd and showed no signs of slowing. Wherever the gate was, it could apparently wait. After a full minute of walking, Djrek arched his eyebrow at Sal.

Sal huffed. "Okay, why would having daughters be so bad?"

"It's not if you marry them off well."

Sal frowned. "You make it sound like they're supposed to be sold like drajin."

Djrek shrugged. "Might have gone better if he had."

"What, _why?_"

Djrek said nothing, but his lips pinched. They turned down a narrow side street and into the shadows. The buildings seem to tower over the narrow alley.

"Okay. He was generous and he _didn't_ sell his daughters off and that is why it got bloody."

Again Djrek said nothing. His lips had relaxed, but he seemed to pointedly look around at nothing in particular. He'd given enough details; Sal had to figure out the rest.

"Right," Sal began to half talk to himself as they turned down another side street, now walking parallel to the first but with far fewer people, "he was a good man and probably loved his daughters. So what did he _do_? He would want them to have everything, so... he gave them everything?"

They turned down another alley. This one was almost empty, except for a few groups that appeared to be gathering discarded trash into neat piles; the smell wasn't pleasant. They had to weave through boxes and piled up trash. Sal continued to chew on the problem. When was being good and generous a bad thing?

"He let them choose who they would marry and oh— since he wasn't good at politics, neither were they."

He got a grunt from Djrek for that. He was on the right path but he was still missing something. Something with the daughters and the money...

"What was the... uh, contract?"

"Contract?"

"The— there's word for this, for how to give your stuff to another when you die."

"Ah, a will."

"Yeah, what was it?"

"Simple. He divided up his estate equally between them."

Seemed fair, but obviously it ended badly. Unless... "What would happen if one of the daughters died?"

A wide grin broke Djrek's complacent expression. "Why, it would still be divided equally, of course."

Oh? Oh...

Djrek suddenly veered off down another alley. Sal, not expecting it, walked three paces before he realized it, but when he turned to follow Djrek, he found his mentor missing.

Sal's heart hitched, then beat a slow, hard rhythm. He blinked slowly and peered into shadows cast by tall buildings blocking a morning sun. He looked back the way they'd come, then opposite it toward where they'd been walking. A weathered man wearing rough-spun, thick gray clothing emerged from a door about twenty five paces from Sal, carrying a crude wooden box. He unceremoniously dumped it into one of the trash piles, then his eyes narrowed on Sal.

Sal rushed into the alley. He slowed after eight steps, but kept a fast pace. His eyes darted to each shadow, both looking for Djrek and danger alike. Twice he passed a huddled rag-covered, emaciated person-shaped mass still sheltering from the night's cold. Twice he flinched back, hand darting to the knife sheathed at this back.

The alley seemed to extend forever, but after four hundred and twenty three paces he found it's end. Then, just as suddenly as he'd disappeared, Djrek was walking by his side. Sal didn't quite flinch, but he still had to force himself to release his grip from the knife at his back.

"You wouldn't believe how quickly true love comes knocking when there's that much money on the line." Djrek spoke as though nothing strange had happened.

"Where were..."

Sal trailed off and stared at him, but Djrek's face betrayed nothing, almost maintaining the same pleasant look as always. Almost, except for a tightness around his eyes and mouth. He was... disappointed?

After twelve seconds of walking, Djrek looked over and raised an eye brow. Sal sighed, and thought through the conversation.

"So the daughters married men who were just in it for the money... and then the husbands killed their wife's father?"

"Actually no, they couldn't. Patricide or matricide removes you from any inheritance no matter what the original will says. Instead, it goes to the Empire."

"That seems oddly specific."

Djrek grunted out agreement. "Things become too unstable when children start killing their fathers for the throne. Even a hint of it would cost them the inheritance. So no, they wouldn't risk it. Also, it wasn't a problem; Hontima had a reputation for living large."

"They had to wait him out," Sal nodded, eyes on the street while he thought. "and then... what? Oh!" He was such an idiot; it was obvious, "they started killing each other." But the thought felt ridiculous. "Really, though? Killing each other?"

Djrek stopped suddenly. Sal was so taken up in his thoughts he took a full three steps before realizing it. When he turned back, Djrek wore a quizzical expression.

"If there is one thing Royals are good at, it is killing each other for power... and money... and honor or insults or their reputation or whatever other reason they can come up with. Really, they're all just flavors of power."

He knew Royals could be brutal but Djrek made it sound like a never-ending blood bath. His expression must have reflected this for Djrek's expression softened, then he wagged his head.

"I'm not saying that's _all_ they do or that even all Royals are blood-thirsty. Youlson was ambitious, but hardly blood thirsty; and your friend Rinley is... odd, but never underestimate what a Royal will do for power. For instance..."

Djrek raised his eyes and began to walk. He brushed past Sal, who watched him continue down the road as though he hadn't just started a sentence without finishing it.

Sal cocked his head and forced his teeth to unclench. "Okay, I guess I follow."

The road they walked widened a little and then opened up into a large square. It was lined with restaurants, most of which had tents erected over small tables where a spattering of people produce a low din of conversation. In the center of the square, a massive statue stood on a pedestal taller than Djrek... or no, _statues_, plural; there were several.

Djrek picked up his pace and walked straight for it. Sal followed, his eyes glued to the statues.

Sal counted seven women standing in a semi-circle. They all wore elaborate sari in an outdated style, with one loose end thrown over a shoulder. They were different ages and their arms were outstretched, faces enraptured, as though they sought to embrace the city itself, or... perhaps a lover. All except the center woman, clearly older with hints of her age worn in lines around her eyes. She stood tall, nose uplifted with an imperious look, but her eyes looked haunted, and her arms were at her side, forever clutching her wrap in a death grip. Something was wrong with her neck. It was too long, maybe, or shaped not quite right. Sal was tempted to think the artist had made a mistake except every other detail was perfect.

In the center was what Sal would describe as fat, jolly man. His head was thrown back mid-laugh, arms on his hips as though to support his belly. Just looking at him made Sal want to smile. This was a man who knew how to enjoy life, how to live it without regret. It was a man you'd instantly like, just because his uproarious laugh made you feel happy inside.

Drjek paused in front of the pedestal. "The Daughters of Hontima." He walked to the left of the pedestal and stopped in front of the two furthest statues, the youngest of the sister. "Elora and Rhian died in house fires within a week of his death. Their homes burned so hot that it lasted barely an hour and cracked the foundation. Investigations later revealed that both homes had accelerant embedded into the foundation and walls themselves, likely during construction."

"What about her?" Sal pointed at the oldest sister.

Drjek ignored him. "No one was fooled by the fires except perhaps the other sisters, who wept yet refused to believe the truth. They simply couldn't believe it of their own husbands, who continued to dote on them."

Djrek walked over to the next sister over.

"Sisira, who'd recently born a boy, died when bandits accosted her family on their way to town."

Sal jerked his head to Djrek in surprise. "There were bandits then?"

"No," Djrek shook his head slowly, "there were not."

Sal more mouthed than said the word, "Oh."

Djrek led Sal past the oldest sister to the other three on the opposite side. He stopped at the two on the far right.

"These two were found slaughtered in their homes along with their husbands and servants. They, at least, had not born children yet, but there was no attempt to hide the truth. It had not yet been three weeks since Hontima's death."

Sal stared up at the sisters. They looked so... hopeful. "I guess there's no law against murdering your siblings."

"Murder is always illegal, but rarely enforced among the Royals unless it's painfully obvious and, even then, something obvious is more likely staged."

He moved to the center right sister, the second to last.

"Sora's family died peacefully in their sleep. They'd barricaded themselves in the house, but someone poisoned the water or food— no one is sure, but some say the air itself was poisoned. However it happened, they all went to sleep that night and simply never woke back up. She had born two daughters and one son."

Finally, he moved to stand before the elder sister, but instead of speaking, he waited silently, staring up into her face. Sal placed himself next to Djrek and stared up with him.

"What's wrong with her neck." At this angle, the neck really didn't look right.

"She hung herself."

So the neck _was_ too long and, if Sal tilted his head, he thought he could see where the rope might be. It was subtle, almost not noticeable unless you knew what to look for.

"Many believe she took part in the slaughter of her sisters, and that was why she hung herself."

"Did she?"

Djrek shrugged. "I don't think we'll ever know, but I doubt it. She would have had to have been consumed with greed and avarice or, perhaps, simply be a sociopath, to systematically kill her sisters for money she did not need. A person like that would not suddenly be overcome with guilt when their goal was within reach. No, I think it more likely she was overcome with grief over the loss of her whole family and confronted with the truth that it was her husband, and her ignorance of him, that led to their deaths."

Sal stared up at her face for a long time. Her eyes seemed to hold horror at bay from sheer will. After thirty seconds he nodded firmly. "She hid the truth. She knew but she refused to believe until. And that was what drove her to kill herself."

Instead of answering, Djrek shifted his gaze to the man in the center. "He died believing he'd given his daughters the world."

Sal shifted his gaze to the man. A wide cloth belt wrapped his belly, looking strained to hold it. It was tied in a snug knot at his side, where the cloth flowed loosely to knees that were bent slightly. The pants were billowous down to calf-heigh, tight boots, into which they'd been tucked. He was man of fashion, who laughed freely and lived life to the fullest. He was a man no one could hate, yet the disgust in Djrek's voice was hard to miss.

"Anton Hontima," the words were a curse on Djrek's lips, "died having given his people a good life. He died having built great things. He died believing he was a good man."

Djrek's eyes hardened. "But he left them vulnerable."

"Verona's husband inherited everything, of course," Djrek continued. "But that was not enough for him. He tripled the taxes, then doubled them again when the quarry's profits began to decline— her husband was not a good businessman. He was, however, very good at hiding his money, which he passed on to a son born to him from a later marriage. After he died, that son erected gates across the river and started charging barges for passage. This caught the attention of the Longsuns, who launched a very thorough investigation that lasted years. Finally, the grandson was charged for tax evasion and the whole family lost their holdings. The city came under the direct rule of the Longsuns, who reduced the taxes and began to fix the economy. They were the ones who commissioned this statue.

"Three generations suffered because this man," Djrek gestured to the fat statue, "refused to accept reality, refused to sacrifice even the smallest part of his daughters' happiness to protect them or even teach them how to protect themselves. The Longsuns erected this statue as a warning to all: good intentions are not enough."

He turned to Sal. "But there's still one missing piece to the story."

"Us," Sal guessed.

"Us," Djrek dipped his head slowly. "An Inquisitor was sent here after the first two daughters died. Hontima wasn't big, but they'd become the primary supplier of granite, and disruption would have a rippling effect on the Empire. Inquisitor Sureal quickly figured out what was going on and he knew what he had to do..."

Djrek trailed off, and Sal sighed. "Kill the husbands."

"Instead, he chased down false leads in an attempt to discover their plans and expose them or stop them or something, but the husbands had years to plan and he was always one step behind. So the daughters died and three generations suffered because one Inquisitor couldn't do his fucking job."

Sal looked over at Djrek in surprise; that was passion he heard, that was anger. Djrek was never angry, ever, yet now he expressed it for something that happened hundreds of years before he was born?

"But did he know if all the husbands were involved?"

Djrek's pleasant expression returned. "No, he did not."

Sal paused, frowned. "Do _we_ know if all the husbands were involved."

"No, we do not."

"So it could have been only one of them."

Djrek nodded. "Certainly Verona's husband."

"Yeah, right... and... and her..." he pointed at the second to last daughter to die, just to the right of the Verona.

"Sora."

"Yeah, Sora. They barricaded their house. That's someone who's trying to protect their family, not someone who's planning murder."

"I concur."

"So? If the Inquisitor killed him, he'd have killed an innocent man."

"He would have."

"That would be wrong..."

"Would it?" Djrek turned to face Sal; his finger and thumb tapped each other repeatedly. "Consider. When he arrived, only two sisters had died. According to his own notes, he quickly realized the sisters were not the kind to kill each other. Also, the sisters were well regarded by the town itself; they were loved just as much as their father had been. The only possible suspects were the husbands but, as you have pointed out, he didn't know which ones were doing the killing."

"Right! So—"

"_However,_" he raised his fist and extended a finger, "he did know that Hontima was a critical town for the Empire. The influx of cheap granite from this town did much to ease the strain of the Elderin prohibitions. Loosing this town would— no, _did_ cause considerable strife up to and including riots and the rebellion of an entire province, all which had to be put down at considerable cost of life."

"Moreover," another finger raised, "whichever husband survived would have been the most ruthless and greedy of them all. There's only one motive here, and it does not lend itself well to the governance of a town. One could surmise that whomever 'won' would strip the town of everything they could, which is exactly what happened."

"He also knew," he raised a third finger, "that the sisters would govern the town well, even in their grief. While they were naive about politics and men, they were still quite intelligent and they'd learned business from their father. Loosing their husbands would hurt, and they would certainly hate the Inquisitors for it, but they would also learn a very important lesson on trust.

"Finally," he raised a fourth finger, "he made his choice before _any_ of the other sisters had died; there were still five left and every single one of the husbands appeared innocent. Remember, they'd had years to plan this. Unravelling all those plans would take time he did not have. He knew this and—"

"You seem good at unravelling them," Sal half mumbled to himself and looked down at the stone beneath his feet.

"Yes, I am, but even I must make choices with imperfect information and Sal, let me be clear," with a meaty finger, he pulled Sal's chin up until their eyes met, "we are not here to protect the innocent. We're here to protect the future."

Djrek removed his finger from Sal's chin, turned, and stared back up at the statues. "He knew what would happen if he failed; he knew the best solution was to remove all the husbands; but instead, he gambled with the future of the sisters, this town, and even the Empire itself, all because he didn't want to kill innocent men."

"What happened to him?"

Djrek's lip curled. "He was stripped."

Sal blinked. "Stripped?"

Djrek closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then let it out slowly, shuddering. "There is a process that will remove from an Inquisitor all his power— _all_ of it. Not just our enhancements, but our very ability to use gravtech itself. It leaves us as... as a shell with nothing in it."

"I don't understand."

"I know, but you will, someday. What you need to understand is that it's the worst thing that could be done to us."

"Just because he messed up?"

"He didn't just mess up, Sal. We don't punish failure— that's just part of the process— but there is a point at which you choose to stop being an Inquisitor and once you've made that choice, the Inquisitor is removed from you."

"He stopped being an Inquisitor—"

"When he chose compassion for a few over the future of tens of thousands of lives and of the Empire."

Sal looked over, but Djrek still had his eyes on the statues.

"Inquisitors are not good people. We do not protect the weak; we do not serve justice; we do not have mercy on the innocent. The fear and hate we inspire is well deserved." He turned back to Sal and clasped his hands behind his back. "But we are necessary. We are the violence upon which civilization stands. As an Inquisitor, you will be feared and despised, but you will have the greatest purpose to which one can aspire. Without us, there can be no peace."

He held Sal's eyes for three seconds before Sal lowered them. Sal spent twenty-two seconds thinking through all he'd just said. Inquisitors weren't good people, but he'd known this deep down. Yet Sal didn't crave to be a good person; he'd never had dreams of being a hero like Roland. He wanted something more. He had once wanted to be a soldier, but that was just the job. What he really wanted was purpose. He wanted to matter, and he could think of no greater way to matter than to be an Inquisitor.

With steel in his eyes, he raised them and met Djrek's own. He jerked his head in a nod.

Without a word, Djrek turned and walked away from monument. Sal spared another glance at the fat man and his naive daughters.

Sal turned and jogged twelve paces to catch up with Djrek, who was walking toward the far corner of the square. Ash was there, casually leaning against a building, watching them approach. Beyond her was a wide road and, Sal realized, beyond that was the river.

Ash had a question in her eyes, to which Djrek responded with a shake of his head.

Sal slowed, trailing Djrek and stopped several paces short of the pair.

He closed his eyes, and clenched his jaw, working his frustration through his teeth. They remained clenched when opened his eyes as spat out a single word through his teeth, "bait."

Djrek nodded. "You've been bait for quite some time, longer perhaps than you realize. That you recognize it is good, very good."

But it wasn't good. Not the bait part, that was fine— or, well, at least he'd accepted it intellectually, even if his emotions were still catching up. It didn't even bother him that'd it taken him months to realize he was being used at bait; it's not like he'd been bait before.

But having figured it out, he sure as the gods were damned should have known _when_ he was being the bait. It was obvious in retrospect, all the side paths and alleys, weaving through trash; Djrek had been giving them an opportunity to attack. But Sal hadn't realized it. He'd been distracted, consumed with the story. He'd dismissed the obvious clues simply because he was busy with something else. It was simply unacceptable. If he was going to be an Inquisitor, he'd have to do better.

If he wanted to live at all, he'd have to do better.

He took a deep breath and held it, just like Roland used to do. The lack of air burned after only twenty seconds. He let that burn consume his frustration, clear his mind. After forty three seconds he began to fee light headed. He let the air out slowly, and imagined his curling away, dissipating in the wind.

He would do better.

Djrek watched the whole thing with interest; Ash had looked out at the river. Sal gave Djrek a terse nod, and all three began their walk once again.

Sal asked no more questions, but he kept eyes and ears open, ready for anything... he hoped.
