# 89 | Uninvited

Roland sat, legs folded under him, and stared at his pack with a conflicted expression. His ears caught the various grunts, shouts, clacks, clangs, and curses of a camp near ready to strike-out. Skyra lay curled in a corner, as usual sleeping away the morning. A bright blue sky cast spidery shadows of bare branches that waved lightly on his tent canvas.

It would be a good day to travel, or so he’d been told.

The pack was made of quality, oiled leather. He’d used it for several years until the flap’s base had earned itself a worn, cracked look that told a simple story of many openings. Inside, a simple divider created two compartments. In the back, he would store his food. The front would contain extra clothes, then healing balms, wraps, thread and needle, all items for first aid. On top of that, he would place his hunting gear, more often tailored to whatever beast of the moment he was to hunt or perhaps to the environment if warranted.

A rope was all he had left. The food had long ago been consumed and healing items used on Anna mostly. His extra cloths used, then torn by his fight with the Sabre, and now replaced with the generous donations of camp members grateful for his assistance. The clothes weren’t quite up to the standard he’d grown accustomed to.

The picks, he realized for the first time, were lost, and he suspected it was an expensive loss. He couldn’t recall when that’d happened. His flight down the mountain, probably. Ironically, the pack hadn’t been designed for that sort of activity, and he was mildly surprised nothing else had fallen out during the adventure.

It was a good pack, good quality. He had never realized just how good until he’d noticed the varied packs of other expedition members. It’s not that theirs were bad, not even in the least. Theirs were made for rigors of extended hardship, and so too was his. But his was a step above, a step beyond theirs with thicker stitch, better leather, better rivets, and clearly crafted with care.

Except it wasn’t his.

Over the years, he’d come to think of it as his own. And so he had also of his clothes, his weapons, his boots. But Rose had given him these things. She’d bought them from some store or person and provided them as the normal course of his training. And they were not cheap, or at least so he’d implicitly gathered from the others.

He’d always thought of these things she gave him as his own, and reality had never condescended to challenge his assumption. Until now.

He couldn’t recall making the decision to stay here, though he could easily recall the many times he believed it impossible. He’d told Anna he would stay, but that had been a lie no matter how much he wanted it to be true.

He could still feel the echo of his inevitable return to her as though all this were nothing more than a dream. But the dream never ended, and the expedition had made the practical decision — no doubt due to Jonah’s insistence — to work back toward a profitable grove they’d passed weeks ago. He was simply expected to go with him. He’d never actually said no, and by this virtue alone did he now stare at his pack with the stark realization that it was not his.

He needed a pack, of course, just as he needed weapons, clothes, boots, and food. These things weren’t optional, and it wasn’t as if he had the option to return them. To do that would be to return himself. Like offering meat in hand to a hungry predator, it would not be just the meat it consumed.

Perhaps that was why this had never been an issue. She’d owned him, and always had from that first delirious moment he woke in her home. It didn’t matter whether he considered these things his, hers, or some random stranger’s. She’d owned him and the things she gave him, and that so easily nullified whatever fiction his mind made up.

It did now, though, it mattered what he did.

To take the pack now was to steal it from her. It would not be his first theft, of course. His first theft was nothing less than that of himself. By choosing to leave, he would steal from her the countless years of her investment, the training she’d so brutally administered to make him what he was. The value of this, an immortal’s time, was nothing less than priceless and the sin of its larceny deserving of nothing less than the frozen hells of below. Compared to that, the pack was nothing.

Yet it was significant, even if only as a symbol. It represented a choice he’d never made, yet one he could never turn back from. The camp was leaving, and he would go with it, following the girl who’d won his heart unto the very ends of the world itself. That unmade choice had solidified into obsidian, and so a choice had somehow been born in a place where none was allowed.

So, the pack.

It was his now, and so was he. His choice was what to put in it and what to leave out. He would take this craftsmanship and make it his own in truth. He would own himself by this simple choice.

But what to put in it?

He stared at the accouterments he’d gathered for the journey. Food, extra clothes, and bandages he’d pilfered from the camp supplies. All these things he knew and so slowly, his brow furrowed, he placed his extra cloths at the bottom of the front pocket.

Perhaps he should do it differently, now that he was free, yet he could think of no other way.

To keep things balanced, he placed food in the back pocket, though only enough to keep the balance. He added the bandages, wraps, a poultice, thread, and needle on top of the cloths. Now more food, again, only for balance.

He felt like it should be different, yet it was packed as it always had been.

He stared at the rope. There should be more. More food, more gear for the hunt. But the food already was overkill, and this was no hunt. His pack was too light, and yet he still stared at the rope. He wanted to put the rope in. It made the most sense, the only sense really, but it would make everything the same.

With a final resolve, he closed up the pack, secured it, and picked up the rope in his other hand. Perhaps the camp could use it.

He strapped on his harness and weapons, then paused. He’d never considered whether they were his or hers. How odd, and yet the truth presented itself right away. He’d already paid for them with his blood. Of all the prices that could be paid, this should be enough. He’d never considered them simply because the truth was too obvious to consider. And so he felt no guilt as he strapped them to his person.

He stepped out of his tent into a frozen camp. He blinked once, then twice for good measure. Anna looked to have been heading to his tent while Fin stood in front of his own. Stan was further away by a fire that burned loudly, ignorant that it was the only sound to dare shatter the silence.

All heads were turned to stare at a common point, though he didn’t bother to follow their gaze. It wasn’t necessary. In truth, this silent, frozen camp had captured him. He tried to recall when the camp had fallen silent, but he’d been too deeply trapped in his musings to tease out the knowledge. No matter, for what was presented to his senses had wrapped him up in fascination.

Jonah stood by what Roland had privately dubbed the weapon’s tent, though it contained far more tools for logging than actual weapons. The tent had been mostly disassembled and its contents placed in boxes and crates, most of which had already been loaded on a sled.

Jonah had clearly been making for it with great haste, only to stop frozen. It was such an odd sight that Roland couldn’t help himself from staring. Jonah, of all of them, had at least divined a practical course of action, and yet still retained enough wisdom to concede defeat. He felt a surge of admiration for the man.

He tore himself from the Jonah and found Alistair in his stead. In truth, he’d barely spent any time with the man, a regret he felt keenly. Alistair stood outside the command tent — again, only a term Roland had coined privately — and he almost looked regal. Perhaps a general before some ill-fated battle. That seemed right.

His eyes continued on to scan across a dozen or so faces of loggers. They held a variety of visages. Horror, fear, terror, hopelessness. All these emotions had been painted in exquisite detail across their faces. It was almost beautiful, in a cruel way, but one perhaps he understood more than most. He of all knew that feeling of helplessness before an impossible power.

It was with extreme regret that he returned his attention to his friends.

Fin, ever the comedic relief wrapped under a desperate desire to live life to its fullest. Roland stared at his unexpected friend. That desire had been threatened, ground into dust, yet Roland thought he could still see that defiance, that endless ‘fuck you’ emanating from his eyes, if not his lips. Of all his new friends, he wondered if he could have learned the most from Fin.

Stan stood as... well, Stan. He alone somehow managed to keep his composure amidst the horror that had descended upon them. He almost looked to be readying himself for a lecture, which was its own kind of farce. Roland reflected that perhaps the comedy of Fin and Stan was more inevitable than he’d first presumed.

Finally, he turned his attention to Anna. She alone had heard — or perhaps sensed — him leave his tent. She stared at him with eyes that broke his heart.

“No... no, not like this.”

He wasn’t actually sure he heard those words or simply saw them in her eyes. Yet no matter what emotions they contained, or perhaps because of them, he almost lost himself in those eyes yet again. It was a desperate desire, one he yearned for. But it was not to be. Those eyes were lost to him now as surely as Ionia would be forever beyond his reach.

He walked to her and laid his hand gently on her cheek.

“I’m so sorry,” he said in barely more than a whisper. The silence, after all, was sacred.

Her eyes held back confusion, terror, and a reborn hope cruelly slaughtered. For a moment, he tried to regain that sense of loss, but it had slipped beyond his reach into an obsidian certainty.

The dream had finally ended, and reality once again established itself as proper. Under this, his uncertainty had vanished to bring back what he’d always known he was, a hunter.

He stalked forward, but Anna grasped him with a surprisingly strong grip. “What are you doing?” she whispered frantically. “*Don’t... provoke ... it*.” Her words came out sharp and slow, tinged with terror.

He turned back to her with sad eyes. “Oh, but it was provoked so many years ago. That...” he paused to think of an appropriate metaphor and thought of the islands they would never settle on, “...that ship has sailed.”

He made to pull away, but her grip only tightened. His eyes hardened in response.

“Stay here,” he growled at her before prying her off him. “It only wants me.”

And indeed, whereas before the wyrm had watched the whole camp, once it saw Roland, its eyes narrowed on him alone. It made no move yet, but its eyes never left him.

The challenge was clear.

“Are you _insane_?”  She’d abandoned her whisper.

“Does it matter?”

“Maybe it’ll go away?”

He guffawed out a laugh and immediately regretted it. Hope still blinded her so that she couldn’t understand there could only be one way out of this.

Roland stalked a few steps toward the wyrm but stopped and rounded on Anna, who had followed a couple steps behind him.

“I said, stay back.”

“You go, I go.”

“I can’t—”

“You can’t what?”

Roland felt a profound sense of sadness and helplessness envelope him. There was no way around it. He would have to use every talent at his disposal to win this. She would see him, see all of what he was and... and... he didn’t know. But nothing would ever be the same.

It just wasn’t supposed to be like this. All of his dreams of escaping burned under morning’s light, just as they always did, and with hope as their fuel.

It had ever only been a dream, after all.

“I’m sorry, but you can’t follow. I can’t protect you...”

He met a confused gaze that quickly flared into anger. “Protect me? I don’t _need_ you to protect me.”

He was proud and sad to see such defiance. Here before him was one who would spit at a tornado only moments before demise. Oh, but how he hungered for her at that moment.

“Just please, please stay back.”

Without waiting for a reply, he turned back to the patiently waiting wyrm. There would be no running this time. Either he would win, or they all would die.

He had spent endless hours thinking about the wyrm as he planned for the day when he would be hunted by one of the fiercest beasts of the forest. He had grown a lot since their first meeting, but then, the wyrm no doubt knew this.

He stopped suddenly and felt Anna bounce against his back. He shook his head with a small smile. So stubborn.

He anchored to as many trees around him as possible, and his smile widened at the sudden twitch of the wyrm’s tail. Too many targets to destroy this time. He was no longer a little mouse to run in fear. No, the wyrm would regret this day, no matter the outcome, of that he would make sure.

He ignored the gasps from behind him as he _pulled_ to bring himself up to the eye level of the white abomination. It reached even the lower branches of Whitewoods, which was far beyond impressive.

The thing was huge. Ten people could stand on their shoulders and not reach its eyes. He supposed that was a good part of the reason for the camp’s fear, but Roland knew from experience that size wasn’t everything.

He blinked once again and took in the sheer mass of the thing. Ok, maybe size mattered, but it sure as hell wasn’t everything. He repeated that to himself several times.

He had anchored dozens of trees, kept several taut in anticipation, and relished the familiar tension within his body. It brought its own kind of comfort, a familiar feeling that whispered of freedom and power.

He casually reached down and grabbed a knife. It was time to start this dance.

Roland threw the dagger straight toward the wyrm and _pushed_ it with his gravics. He silently thanked Stan in the back of his mind for providing the final, missing piece of strategy he needed. Yet it wasn’t nearly enough as the wyrm dodged the knife and lunged at him while the knife embedded into a nearby tree.

Roland _pulled_ himself hard, snapping to the side at a speed that would have driven him to unconsciousness without his cycle. Even then, spots swam around in his eyes as a warning.

The wyrm looked back in surprise at the miss. It hadn’t really been all that close.

Roland smiled a small, vicious smile and raised his bolt caster. He fired it just before he released another knife just to the left of the wyrm. It dodged to the right, maybe anticipating the move or perhaps luck had tossed her die against him. His knife thudded into another tree.

He dodged up this time to keep himself unpredictable. The wyrm tried to snap its head to catch him but missed by a fair margin. Roland fire another bolt and followed that with a dagger but yet again only embedded it in another tree.

Roland dodged, yet the wyrm didn’t counter. Instead, it dodged an unexpected attack, and he turned in surprise to see a knife embed into another tree. He looked over to see Anna retrieving another knife from her person.

Damn, but that would complicate things. The wyrm took all of his attention, and he wasn’t sure he’d be able to protect her as well.

As if to punctuate the point, the wyrm’s tail whipped out and sent a wave of destruction toward the camp. A spear of dread pierced him as he saw the wave tear apart a corner of the camp. Fin and Jonah went flying back from the blast. If only they’d stay out of the fight, he was sure the wyrm would ignore them.

Another knife flew at the wyrm, missed, and then embedded itself into another tree.

Seeing the beast’s attention shift to Anna, Roland threw a knife, followed by a shot from the bolt caster and another knife. Again he staggered the pattern to try to catch the wyrm’s dodge, and again both blades only ended up embedded into the trees.

The wyrm abandoned Anna as a nuisance and returned its attention to Roland. It struck before Roland could dodge and clipped his leg.

He careened out of control and desperately tried to regain his sense of direction. He dodged randomly, not sure of where the wyrm was but certain it would take advantage of his confusion.

A white blur streak by him, missing him by a hair.

Before he’d had a chance to fully recover, the wyrm had reversed and come in for another attack. He _pulled_ himself into a dodge as fast as he could, but his head was already swimming and his sense of direction thrown off. He dodged the bulk of the attack, but it’s tail once again clipped him, this time in his chest. Just that glance rocketed him into a tree.

He heard a loud crack that could have been his head or the tree itself, he wasn’t sure. His eyes swam, the world twisted, his legs ached, and he was certain he’d cracked his ribs... again. A voice intruded into his mind to inform him that perhaps he should focus his cycle there for a little while if only to prevent this sort of thing. Also, he might want to dodge.

He dodged.

He had no idea if it worked and something about that felt depressingly familiar. Moreover, it just made his head swim more than it already was. He also had no idea where he was, what orientation he was in or, more importantly, where the wyrm was.

Dodging randomly had not worked well with the linrix and wouldn’t now. Not one to make the same mistake twice, he shifted himself about until he was aimed at the brightest spot he could find, and then he _pulled_ hard.

Branches slapped, scrapped, and ripped at his face before he found nothing else to _pull_ on. And so he drifted into the sky while he tried hard to blink away the spots and the swimming world below him.

Then he fell.

He knew that, and it felt mildly critical, just behind the need to get his own senses under control. He took a breath, and then followed it with another for good measure. Everything had happened so fast he’d barely had time to breathe. For just a moment, it all felt pleasant as the blue world above bared itself with such homogeny that the spots in his eyes quickly resolved. That same stupid, insistent, asinine voice in his mind insisted he turn himself about.

So he did, and his eyes widened at the quickly approaching treetops.

Falling was a hard thing to accomplish correctly. He could _pull_, but that was a two-edged sword, or so the saying went. He could alter his direction but only at the expense of acceleration, which was the opposite of his current desire. Had he more experience in _pushing_, he might have done that, but he was quite certain that would only acerbate the problem given his inexperience. The Whites littered this forest, and reentry into one of them would do the wyrm’s job far more efficiently than it could ever hope for.

Also, where was the Wyrm?

He had a moment, maybe two, so he scanned quickly. The wyrm eluded him, but the camp was surprisingly easy to make out. How the hell had they survived like that?

He _pulled_ to bring him to the camp.

Gods below, but he felt guilty for that. He should be leading the great beast away from the camp, yet he needed orientation and to know where the damn thing was. As he entered the treetops, he adjusted his angle at the expense of increased acceleration to avoid the branches or at least the largest of them. The smaller ones still tore at him, and at the end of it, he wondered whether there was much left of his face.

He’d also spotted the wyrm, and it looked confused. Once again, he considered the positive effects his insanity had on an opponent. It seemed that nobody truly knew what to do with an insane opponent. Perhaps it was simply the unpredictability and randomness of it, yet never had random a better companion than insanity.

Roland smiled and threw a dagger.

It missed, again, and embedded in a tree. Somehow the great white beast anticipated him, even when it had no idea of from where he came. Frustrating, but it must sense his gravics. He could try throwing it physically, and maybe it would hit, but it certainly wouldn’t do damage.

Again Roland threw another dagger and paired it with a bolt that resulted in yet another dagger embedded into another tree. This continued for some time in a dangerous dance of bolts, daggers, and counterstrikes.

Anna continued to throw her own daggers but never attained the sheer power as Roland. At best, she provided an occasional — and desperately needed — distraction for him. It was useful and more than that, for a few moments, he felt as though they fought together.

The only break from this was a discontinuous moment in which Fin came charging at the wyrm, sword in hand while firing bolts from his other. The wyrm somehow adopted a look of disbelief, which must have mirrored his own face. It casually whipped its tail around as the man approached and flung a gravic wave that sent Fin flying back into the camp. Roland grunted in appreciation as Fin hit the ground several times before rolling to a stop. So _that’s_ what it looked like. He probably should have used the distraction to attack it, but well, missed opportunity that was.

As the fight restarted, Roland _pulled_ to the right in an attempt to position himself for another dagger throw, but the tree he was anchored to cracked in half. The sound rebounded through the woods as he spiraled out of control.

That really shouldn’t have happened.

There was no way he had pulled that hard, even if he could have pulled that hard at all. But then he noticed the wyrm itself struggling with its own flight, and Roland did a double-take. What just happened?

His eyes widened in realization, and he let out a huh. The wyrm was anchoring to the same trees, using the same _pulls_ he was. He had no idea how to take advantage of this, but for the first time in his life, he’d found someone, something, that _pulled_ the way he did. He felt a profound wave of regret that they were inescapable enemies.

The fight continued until Roland reached down to find no more daggers left to throw. Seeing him without a dagger, the wyrm stopped and cocked its head.

Oh, but no, this was not what it thought it was.

He smiled and replaced his bolt caster on his side, it would only distract him in what was to come. He began to circle the wyrm slowly.

It was time to begin phase two.

The wyrm backed off a little, looking confused. It had seen Roland come up empty-handed, but he didn’t act like it. He acted like he was the predator, which made the wyrm wary.

Roland, on the other hand, forcibly cleared his mind. He needed to focus completely on what came next, or he would risk killing himself just as easily as the wyrm.

The problem with fighting the wyrm was that it always could see the knives coming, and it was far too quick to hit. At its core, the problem was simple. He simply couldn’t throw knives or even cast his bolts fast enough to hit it. He had tried _pushing_ on the knives, but it came at the expense of accuracy. So he was limited in how much power he could put into the knives when he threw them. _Pulling_ however... oh, but how he could _pull_.

As the pair rotated around each other, the tree Roland had targeted lined up, and he _pulled_. A pair of knives embedded in the tree ripped out and came flying at both Roland and the wyrm.

It sensed them and dodged, but it was too little, too late. They ripped through the wyrm’s side. The holes they left seemed comically small, and yet it was the first time he’d ever managed to hit the beast.

Roland immediately let go of the pull, increased his radial motion around the wyrm, and allowed the daggers to fly by him.

Just as he began that first _pull_ of the knives, he’d lined up with the next tree. This time he _pulled_ a trio of knives embedded, two of which were Anna’s. Again they ripped out of the tree and clipped the wyrm on their way to Roland before he released them to go flying by.

He then reached behind himself and _pulled_  on the first pair, now behind him, to bring them toward him as he lined up the next tree.

The next tree lined up, and he _pulled_ on those daggers as well. They ripped through the wyrm and on beyond him as he _pulled_ on the second set to bring them back into the fight.

By this time, the fourth set was lined up, and Roland was well in place to add yet another set of knives to this small storm he’d begun to create. The first set was almost beyond the fight, so he pulled on the fourth and first at the same time, bringing them both at himself at incredible speed.

The fifth set was lining up with at least another half dozen or so more sets of knives to line up. And so he continued to _pull_ repeatedly as he moved around the wyrm. They dispersed and separated as he rotated until he felt as though he were pulling on hundreds at once.

It took every last bit of his focus to keep all the knives under his control.

The wyrm didn’t even stand a chance. From its perspective, daggers flew at it from all directions, and it couldn’t decide on a direction to dodge. The epicenter around which this deadly storm swarmed was Roland as he _pulled_ and released sets at a time in a complex, yet disintegrating pattern, always moving to keep from getting hit while keeping the wyrm centered as his target.

It was too much.

The wyrm was being torn to pieces, but so also was Roland. At some point, he felt a dagger embed into his shoulder. With practice born of endless repetition, he cleared away the pain from his mind.

Another dagger embedded into his leg at the same time he felt a slash across his cheek, but he spared neither any attention. Maintaining so many anchors took every bit of his concentration, and he simply had none left to focus on such trivialities as his own injuries.

The wyrm was in bad shape. He knew this, though distantly, as he struggled to maintain control of the storm he’d created. He couldn’t move faster lest he _pull_ himself into one of the daggers swirling around him. By this same virtue, neither could he move slower or else risk the same fate. So he maintained a diminishing sweet spot where most of the daggers only nicked and cut him. So many had already sliced him that he wondered whether there were any that did not bear his blood.

Yet for all his wounds, the wyrm was in far worse shape. It had made such a valiant effort to dodge that likely more of those blades had been blooded by Roland that by it. Yet those daggers were being pulled with such force that they would tear through its body as though paper, almost at random and often straight through.

The wyrm shifted tactics.

It stopped dodging and flicked its tail at nearby Whitewood. The tree shattered at its base and removed an anchor for both of them as more knives tore through the beast.

It flicked again, and again, destroying more of the Whitewoods at the expense of its own body, collapsing the trees and forcing Roland to adjust his _pull_.

His course became erratic, unpredictable, and more of the knives embedded into him as he failed to keep himself in the epicenter of his own storm. Yet he barely managed the knives themselves that he could hardly account for the unexpected loss of so many anchors.

After a few more moments, it was simply too much, and he was forced to abandon all his anchors or risk pulling too many of the knives into himself. His goal, after all, was to kill the beast, not himself.

He fell.

The ground came up to him far too quickly and drove a couple of the knives deep into him. Confusion and pain clouded his mind. Every attempt to recall the moment into clarity was rebuffed by pain’s cloud. It confused his mind even as a force of desperation welled into his soul.

He must get up. He must fight. These truths were as paramount as they were slippery. He couldn’t grasp them long enough to make sense of the world.

He pushed himself to his knees, though it took several attempts. Inexplicable sounds pierced his mind, thrashing, crashing, cracking, and breaking. They were horrible sounds that demanded his attention, yet he had none to give.

A presence released its grip on his senses, and he panicked. Nothing made sense except that the absence signaled to his soul a kind of dread. It was a need unfulfilled, a man dying of thirst only to watch the water rush away. He could taste his desperation in his mouth. It was the only thing he could taste.

At that moment, an offer was made again, though he could not recall the first time. Only the image of a boy with a face impossible to hold in his mind. It blurred and flickered, yet so clearly reached out to him, offering him something he needed desperately.

He accepted the offer. It wasn’t really a choice.

Reality clarified into a dangerous sharpness, and his eyes snapped open to see the tail of the wyrm disappear into the distance. He smiled viciously and growled in anticipation as he set several dozen anchors ahead of him. He _pulled_ hard enough that he left a crack of sound in his wake.

The wind tore at his eyes only a moment before he shielded them. He pursued at an unnatural pace, had he thoughts enough to notice. The wyrm, though injured, yet still proved a remarkably quarry as it weaved its way through the trees at a speed barely slower than his own.

He _pulled_ and _pushed_ in a manner that propelled him through the forest and resonated in his soul. The was not merely flying, not simply moving through the woods. He willed himself to be, and there he was. The trees, the wind, the animal he pursued, these were all nothing.

He wasn’t merely free, he was a god here, and he owned this place.

Leagues passed in moments before he caught the beast. He reached back, removed his sword, and in a single, fluid motion, scored a long, deep gash into the beast’s side.

It screamed a horrible noise made of both sound and power. The noise assaulted him as the beast twisted about and collapsed. Its body crashed through several trees and dug a wide trench into the earth. When it came to rest, it did not move.

Roland lowered himself to the ground and walked toward the wyrm. His body jarred in pain with every step. He was torn, ripped, bleeding, and impacted with knives. He could feel himself weakening, though it was distant, more like an abstract concept than an immediate reality that must be dealt with.

As he reached the wyrm, it slowly raised its head to look him in the eye. What Roland saw there made him pause. There was no anger, no sadness, no regret. Just an alien intelligence he now found far too familiar.

Its pupils dilated as its wings snapped open.

He formed a shield to deflect the attack, then grunted in surprise and strain as he was inundated with a pulsing pressure that slammed against his shield repeatedly.

He pushed as much energy into his shield as he could, and yet he could barely keep up. The wyrm was emptying every last bit of strength it had and showed no signs of slowing.

The escalation continued as the wyrm compressed vast amounts of energy into Roland’s ever-growing shield. At some point, he dropped to his knees, though he was barely cognizant of the fact. All he knew was that the energy they’d built would have to go somewhere when one of them gave out, and everything he loved was behind him, threatened by this beast that refused to die.

He would not allow that to happen. It would not hurt her, ever. It would never be allowed that.

He grunted as he applied more energy into his shield.

The wyrm dipped its head, and for a moment, he thought it might weaken, yet the deluge only strengthened.

Roland screamed in frustration and fell to his hands as he poured even more of himself into the shield. It had enlarged to almost triple its original size.

At some point, heat had built up from the compression of so much energy. He blinked away the sweat that had dripped into his eyes and looked desperately at the wyrm. It had closed its eyes and looked all but dead except for the rhythmic pulse of its wings.

This wasn’t a fight anymore. It was the beast’s last act, and it would destroy everything he loved with it.

Anna was behind him, somewhere. She was ok, she was. He would make sure of it. He would hold back the tide that threatened her.

He poured out more energy into the shield. His body trembled, barely able to hold himself up.

He would keep her safe. She was ok. She would be, she had to be. He opened his mouth to scream, but nothing came out, or perhaps everything did, and he couldn’t hear it. He could feel blood drip down his neck from his ears.

The energies were escaped around the edges of his shield to lash out at the surrounding forest. His shield had grown large enough that he was in no immediate danger, but it would not be long before they threatened him. He bent the edges of his shield outward and, to be safe, drove the bottom into the earth. All of this had been done more as instinct than any conscious thought.

Conscious thought had been dominated by the silent scream ripping apart his throat.

Light began to flash repeatedly near the center of the shield. Each one carved out a blank in his vision and pushed out a wave of heat that made him flinch. The light stabilized, the heat became a constant, and he closed his eyes in pain. Even closed, he felt as though he were staring at the sun.

His face blistered, yet the pain barely registered. He threw up another shield against the heat. It hardly helped.

He couldn’t do it.

The onslaught had not slowed, had not even faltered.

He would lose her. He would lose all his friends, and he would be alone again with Rose. He felt tears leak from his eyes, then evaporate before they could make it down his face. He felt something else drip from his eyes and knew it could not be tears.

He turned his face away from the incredible heat and felt his hair burn.

He poured all he was into a shield he could no longer sense the ends of. It felt as eternal as the tides that held his monster, the one he’d made a deal with.

The monster was the only reason he was alive, the only reason she was still alive. The only way to live was to become the thing he feared the most.

The burning light had vanished now to leave only a memory of it in his mind, and the relentless heat to know it was there. He cried a silent plea into the scorched dark. He could not lose her, even if that meant to give up all that he was.

The boy with a thousand faces stood before him. He was all things and none at all. Behind him was a presence of such mass that defied any imagination. He heard Roland, had come, and where Roland had thrashed and feared this monster, he now would have given his soul to embrace it, if only to save her.

The boy stilled and settled his face. In it was compassion and in that compassion was healing. What Roland looked at was nothing less than himself.

The boy walked up to Roland and looked him in the eyes. In those eyes, Roland found every emotion he’d shoved down, every piece of himself he’d cut out as useless. He saw the lost parts and the ones he still tried to forget. He saw the pain he’d thought he rid himself of.

The boy pulled Roland’s head down and kissed his head.

Roland uncurled himself from the ground and stood. His own body was ragged and torn but whole. He couldn’t see or hear anything, but he didn’t need to. He could sense the tides all around him and knew them as home.

The wyrm continued its onslaught.

The shield was failing. Its edges were ragged, torn, and from them, leaked energies that threatened to undo the forest itself. Reality rippled and twisted about itself to accommodate an endless explosion of energy trapped between the powers of the gods.

He pulled from stores known only to him, hidden in unknown dimensions where the currents play. He pulled from undiscovered places known only by instinct, a kind of knowledge that revealed itself when no one was looking. He pulled from knowledge only available to those who swim the currents of tides too terrible to conceive.

He shored up the holes and expanded the edges to contain the incredible forces involved. He drove the shield deeper into the ground and further up into the sky. He warped it so that when everything unraveled, the blast would be as contained as possible and aimed away from everything important.

Reality itself seemed to stretch and compress. He felt thin and light next to a weight that threatened to consume the world. Flashes of light spun in eyes that no longer existed, his head spun, and then suddenly the pressure was gone.

His shield still held yet, barely, and out from it blasted a cone of destruction that leveled the forest as far as the eye could see.

His shield protected him from the worst of the carnage, but not all. Wind whipped his hair and caressed his face as he was propelled back from the ricochet of the blast’s deflection around his shield.

He distantly felt his body snap against a tree, and then again against the ground several times. Finally, after what seemed an eternity, did motion stop.

He felt no pain. He felt nothing. He floated on a single high tone that rang through his ears into his head and on into his very soul. An impulse to get up twitched his body and nothing more.

With no warning, the darkness consumed his mind.
