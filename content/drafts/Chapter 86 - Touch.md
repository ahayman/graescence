# 86 | Touch

Roland sat upright and sent his covers sprawling. The hairs on his body prickled. Something was wrong, something off, but sleep still clouded his mind and left him with only a vague sense of wrongness and no details.

He scanned for anything amiss through blurred vision, but it was late, and the night’s fire had almost burned down. The dying flames cast the barest of shadows onto the tent. The shadows danced with existence, flickering in and out, shifting and moving to a tune of flame.

All the shadows danced, all except one.

His eyes locked on to that shadow, and it moved.

He scrambled up halfway but stopped suddenly. The shadow had taken form and revealed itself as his eyes finally caught detail the night’s darkness had obscured.

He blinked hard and swallowed nothing down a throat suddenly dry.

Anna stood there, finger over mouth, with a look on her face that turned his stomach into jelly.

He slowly sat back down and dropped the knife in his hand, eyes confused and afraid. A small part of him screamed that she was here to kill him, but another part answered with quiet awe to let her, not that he had much choice. Her eyes pinned him in place just as easily as the strongest bars of gravwood. He felt as powerless before her as would a helpless babe before a storm.

His heart no longer knew restraint, and to his surprise, he found he no longer cared what it did.

She knelt down beside him slow, careful, and tentative as though he were a trapped animal. Her eyes never left his face. They were searching, pleading, desperate, and powerful. He felt trapped in their infinite shades of browns that flickered orange with a dying fire’s light. There was a need in them that called to him, a need he desperately wanted to fulfill.

At that moment, he would have shattered the world if only that she might be satisfied.

She raised a shaky and uncertain arm that triggered in him an unbidden memory of the past. A beast approaches, head low, meek and uncertain, its power contained yet hopeful and offering a warmth he desperately needed.

A small whimper escaped his lips.

She brought her hand up to his face, and just before she touched him, his eyes closed at a kind of fear he’d never known before. Vulnerable. It had been so long since he’d been touched that his mind rebelled against the idea. He should be powerful and strong. He was the hunter, the monster that monsters feared.

And he was helpless, nothing before her. He was but a child with fragile walls holding back a tempest he dared not lose control of.

She threatened everything. She threatened to undo him.

Her touch was but the slightest wisp of a thing, the gentle brush of a warm spring breeze that struck him with the force of an electric gale. It seared his skin, which shuddered and recoiled. He squeezed his eyes shut as he fought a storm of emotion.

Her arm darted back in uncertainty, her face shadowed in doubt.

It left him feeling empty and hungry, and his face reflected a kind of desire he could never understand. He unconsciously leaned in with an invitation he feared to offer and yet could never retract. She reached up again, this time with more certainty.

He stilled his body but could not contain the tremble of his muscles. He ached to feel that touch again and was terrified of what it might do to him. He wanted to lose himself in her touch, yet it threatened him with a tempest that spiraled to the edges of his control.

She brought up her other hand then, and with that same light touch, she caressed his face. Never had he known such pain. Her fingers explored him as they touched and felt the curves of his eyes and nose with a whisper.

She continued for an eternity until every line, every bump, every curve had been consumed. Only then did her fingers begin to trail down to his neck, feeling his pulse and the strain of tendon and muscle.

She was a goddess then, recreating from nothing first his face, then his head, moving down into his neck. He didn’t exist below that. He only knew her touch, only existed where she’d been.

Her fingers trailed down to touch his shoulder.

He flinched back with an audible gasp. He half expected to see her holding a firebrand with the way it had burned. Yet she simply sat there, hands outstretched, frozen, her face curious and with a confusion that echoed his own. He looked down at his shoulder but saw nothing. He touched it and felt nothing but an old faded memory.

She reached for him again, and though he did not stop her, he could not stop himself from tensing, nor slow his heart, nor even out his breath.

Her fingers burned as they found and traced out the shape of a scar, while in his mind, a different shape took hold, and it was one of claws and teeth.

He felt again that desperation to live, and the wild swings of a weapon he could barely manage against so many claws and teeth. He felt every talon as it rendered his flesh. He felt his nerves sever, his blood vessels burst, as tooth and nail violated his body. He felt the panic, the desperation of that day as sharp as any knife, as he cut down Jackret after Jackret in a bid for life.

He’d destroyed two packs that hunt, but it was the second that scarred his soul. The young one had made him its pack, given him back a family, and for that inexplicable kindness, he’d repaid it with rocks. The betrayal burned him.

He felt undone when she had finished, yet she was not done. She moved a shaky hand down his chest and found a new scar to trace. With that scar came another dead memory revived by her touch.

After that one, she found another, and after that yet another. Not every wound scarred him, but too many had. She moved down to his stomach but stopped suddenly. He looked up to see tears streaming down her face.

“They... they’re scars.”

Her gaze pleaded for a different answer, but he had none to give. He lowered his face in shame.

“No!”

She pulled him up by the chin until their eyes met. She opened her mouth to speak, but it was his words that stole the silence.

“Please don’t stop. I need you” to fill the empty.

She stared at him a long time as a thousand emotions warred across her face. Then she nodded.

She reached up, but her hand shook so much that she drew it back to herself. It took her several moments for her to regain enough composure to continue. When she did, her hand still shook.

Each scar brought to surface an old memory, always something he’d buried and forced forgotten to be ravaged by time. With every scar, he relived that moment’s pain with far more acuity than he could ever recall experiencing.

With it, though, came her.

She filled the empty formed by those experiences and made them hers. In so doing, she altered their very nature from something hateful, a weakness to be hidden and buried, and transformed it into something beautiful, something shared, something accepted, but most importantly, something known.

It was that knowing which drew out the poison from them and, for the first time, allowed him to face the truth. Those scars had always been a weakness. And for that, he’d hidden them within the deepest parts of his soul, buried them behind obsidian walls, and turned his back on them that they might fade away into oblivion.

But they hadn’t.

They hadn’t faded away, and time didn’t ravage them. Instead, they’d festered and grown behind those walls. They’d engorged on his insecurities to become hidden monoliths, each one a temple to his failure. He’d tried to hide them behind walls. He tried to forget them. Instead, they defined him, and such a definition had no regard for any wall.

Yet Anna made, or remade, them into something else. For the first time, he could see them as something other than failure. In her acceptance, he found the courage to admit a truth that until then had been all but impossible for him to conceive of.

_He_ had made his pain and these scars his weakness, and he had done so by the simple act of calling it so. He’d given pain a name, and it was called weakness, and so it had become.

But it didn’t need to be so, and under her touch, he saw the truth of what he’d done to himself. Under her touch, he found the power to rename them. Pain was just pain, nothing more, nothing less, and scars nothing but healing. Whatever other meaning it had was given. His pain, his failure, his mistakes, they had made him who he was just as much as his successes and triumphs.

She accepted him, with all the pain and scars, and that gave him the power to rename them. He gave them a new meaning and accepted those scars as part of himself.

She spent a long time on his back, so long that he thought the sun might rise before she was done. She traced a thousand scars on a perfect, flawless body. She drew out a thousand poisons and remade him a thousand times. Her touches never once pressed in more than a light breath’s brush, yet they were relentless and cruel as they destroyed the carefully laid walls he’d so painstakingly constructed.

The night became a contrast of heat and ice as she traced lines of fire into his skin, only to leave them feeling cold from absence. He longed for her to encompass his entire being with her touch. Those parts of him he hadn’t touched felt nothing at all.

Time had lost meaning, each moment expanding to fill an eternity where he writhed in pain, where he felt the sweetest of pleasures until he could no longer distinguish between the two.

Then, finally, the touches ceased.

His face was wet though he couldn’t recall the tears. He lay still motionless, vulnerable, and naked before her. He felt empty, clean, whole, and unmade. His body and mind felt raw.

Anna wept.

He sat up slowly to see her sitting, legs folded under, her head down. Tears dripped from her chin to the floor in an almost rhythmic pattern. He reached, took her chin gently, and pulled her face up until their eyes met.

“Thank you,” he breathed.

She looked at him for a long time.

Then she leaned forward and lightly touched her lips to his.

A desperate ache opened up inside him as his hands found themselves buried in her hair. He breathed deep through his nose to take in her scent as he pressed his lips against hers in return.

Ever so slowly, she pushed him back down as they sought to devour one another. When he lay fully on his back, she lowered herself onto him. His eyes fluttered open when he felt her, all of her, pressed into him.

He scrambled to remove every piece of clothing she had as quickly as possible. It involved a period of awkwardness where clothes stuck to limbs, got caught on stickiness he’d never thought skin could have, yet was removed with a kind of force that only desperation could achieve.

And then there was nothing between them except for them.

His hands began to explore, clumsy and awkward compared to hers, and with a grasping neediness that only seemed to grow. He focused all of those emotions into those kisses, pressing in his need and desire into lips and mouth. She returned them with equal fervor as her own touches grasped him in equal measure.

His lips began to caress first her face, then her neck, moving onto her shoulder and continuing down as desire commanded. At times his kisses seemed to spark a twitch, a shudder, or even a moan, and he would spend time exploring that area thoroughly.

They pressed their bodies into each other as their breath came quick, holding and clinging to each other as hard as they dared.

She shifted her body, and the sensation sent an electric desire through him. His need was a desperate ache unlike anything he’d known before, and whether she sensed that need or mirrored it, she reached down and guided him inside her.

He gasped as she let out a small moan of pleasure. It triggered something in him, and he grasped at her hair to pull her mouth back to his. She began to move back and forth on a thin sheen of sweat that had built between them. His body responded in kind and matched her rhythm as he found himself in a push and pull of pleasure and desire.

As he filled her, so she filled him, the gaps, the scars, and the holes that riddled his soul. The empty inside became just a little more full, and he wanted, needed more of it, more of her.

He rolled them over, him on top while she wrapped her legs around him. With this new dynamic, he increased their pace, taking desire and pushing it over the edge into a fervor that covered them both in flame. Her thighs shuddered, and she exchanged lips for teeth as she bit into his shoulder with a moan that broke skin.

Her body spasmed, and her moans transformed into whimpers that drove his own desire to consume more and more of her. He wrapped his arms beneath her, hooked his hands around her shoulders, and pushed himself deeper as he brought them into a crushing embrace that sought to blur the edges of individuality.

Her whimpers came louder, which he matched unconsciously. Her entire body shuddered, her fingernails dug into his back. He poured everything he had into her, over and over again until his passion could no longer hold back.

His body convulsed as he let out a gasping moan and clung to her as the only possible real thing in the world. She squeezed and pressed him in with trembling legs and arms.

He collapsed then, his arms shaking and his body wrung out. She reached up, pushing stray hair from his face as she looked into his eyes. It was too dark to see any color, yet he felt as though he could lose himself in the moment, her eyes showing a tenderness he’d lacked for so long.

He made to speak, but she placed a single finger on his lips, stalling whatever words had built there. Tonight was not a night for words. She’d shown him that.

Tonight was a night for touch.

After some time, she was nestled into the crook of his arm and rested her head on his chest. His finger trailed through her hair and absently traced outlines on her body as his mind tried to make sense of what happened.

It was no use. He didn’t understand. He’d been putty in the hands of a goddess, and nothing his mind could make of it would ever do it justice. So he stopped trying.

As he lay there, his mind blessedly stilled, his body exhausted, but tingling, he realized something incredible. He could no longer find that coal of hate. In its place was a feeling of song and light, and for the first time in longer than he could remember, he felt happy.
