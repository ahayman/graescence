# 33 | Walk [Sal]

Sal slowly opened his eyes to a splitting headache. He groaned, then blinked three times before the world resolved into coherency. Then he blinked again because what he saw was not very coherent.

He was in an alien world made of gray dust.

Yet all that was beyond. He was nestled in the shade of a tree against which his back rested. His feet lay before him, angled up a steep slope. The tree's canopy cast flickers of shadow and sun, which beat down it's heat from a perfectly blue sky.

Underneath the tree's canopy, leaves, sticks, and the occasional tuft of grass littered a loamy ground as normal as any forest. But beyond was dirt, dust, and almost nothing else. It was dark, like forest loam, yet too thin for that. The breeze picked it up and swirled it around, shifting it as easy as it might ash.

There was nothing about it that made sense. He tried to pull out some kind of memory to enlighten him, but the last thing he recalled was the smell of smoke and... a storm.

He frowned. A storm. He'd been trying to keep up with Roland and tripped, but his memory blurred from there.

He tried to turn his head to see more, but winced as the pounding in his head increased.

He closed his eyes again. Nothing made sense. He could almost believe he'd simply hit his head and... what, slept in the forest? There's no situation in which he could imagine Roland simply leaving him here. Something happened. Something went wrong.

He opened his eyes again and stared at the... ash. Yes, that's what it was. It was too light to be anything else, yet he couldn't imagine how he'd slept through a forest fire. It didn't seem possible. Not to mention that they never had a forest fire— it was too damp here and they didn't have droughts, or not any he'd heard of.

He checked himself. His head was thick and woolly with a dull throbbing ache; likely, he'd been concussed, so he would need to keep his eyes open until the thickness in his head thinned out some.

His arm throbbed. He lifted it and the throbbing increased. He slowly let out a sigh as he lay it back down. Broken or fractured. He felt carefully, poking and prodding as hard as he dared before deciding it was just a fracture. However, he also discovered a long gash where he'd fractured it. It was crusted over with very little redness, which was a bit of relief. Infection would have been bad.

He was covered in bruises, some new, some old but nothing about that was concerning. Bruises he could deal with; they were a constant in his life.

He drew in breath and carefully shifted his legs. No pain, and they worked just fine. He blew back out the tension that had built. A broken arm wasn't great, but a broken leg would kill him quick without a way to walk.

He pushed himself up with his good arm, and drove his head into a steel branch.

"Gods... dammit!"

He slumped down and wrapped his head with his arms until the sharp throbbing subsided into merely a manageable ache... again. It took a few minutes.

He pushed down a surge of fury at his own idiocy. Then, slowly, he stood again, making sure to avoid the branch this time. He looked over and flinched at a twig barely a finger from his eye.

Only then did he finally realize where he was.

A Whitewood. He almost killed himself on it, just like Roland's parents had warned.

Slowly and with great care, he lowered himself back down.

Perhaps he'd hurt his head a little more than he'd thought. Not that it mattered. It changed nothing about what he needed to do, and that was to find home... where ever that was.

He stared again at the ash. It didn't matter. It changed nothing about what he needed to do. Even though it meant everything, he couldn't understand it.

But time. Time he understand. Time was a solid thing, like a warm blanket draped over his shoulders. It flowed always the same, predictable, immutable, understandable. He felt its passage like a physical thing, each second it's own personality, memorable no matter how fleeting. It was a friend that would never leave him, and it's motion had often offered him hope.

He knew that he sat here for six minutes and twenty three seconds now and he must start walking. He knew that at the point he'd tripped, he would have been thirty four minutes from town, less at the rate they'd been running... far more with his head in its current state.

He knew it was three hours and twenty four minutes after the sun's rise. He knew that the sun had risen an hour and twenty four minutes earlier than it did on the Spring equinox.

He knew he needed to find home.

He stole another breath, pushed down a cough, and awkwardly crawled out from under the Whitewood on one hand and two knees. His arms sunk into the ash almost enough to envelope his forearms. It was almost uncomfortably warm, though he couldn't tell if that was from the sun, which seemed to pound down with an uncommon intensity.

He slushed and scratched his way up the incline, stopping several times to cough out black phlegm. He tried to use his shirt to filter out the ash, but it refused to stay hooked on his admittedly smallish nose. The idea of breathing in all this ash concerned him but not quite as much as the need to get home.

After twelve long minutes, the incline leveled out into what might have been considered a path at one time. He collapsed onto his back when he reached it, eyes closed with his face angled away from the sun while let the throbbing in his head and arm subside.

Exactly eight minutes later he stood and looked around.

Again nothing made sense. The entire world was made of thick ash, but sprinkled about were Whitewoods, left alone and pristine among the devastation. Under their canopies were a normal forest, little oases of normality sprinkled about.

There was one Whitewood in the distance that drew his eyes, an older tree with wide low branches, perfect for two boys to climb. If there'd been any doubt before, it was gone now. He knew that tree like he knew the back of his hand. He'd slept in that tree more than once, and he could almost see the leftover sticks he and Roland had left behind, though it was too far to truly tell.

What he did not see was their clearing, or the half rotten tree trunk he'd so often used as a bench. He didn't see the worn paths he and Roland had ground down over the years. Their forest was gone.

It was just... gone. And it made no sense. A forest fire he could at least understand. The Whitewoods were indestructible and probably wouldn't even notice a fire. He could understand everything burning except the Whitewoods. But that's not what happened. Somehow, everything immediately around the Whitewoods were also fine.

Sal spent three minutes and twenty four seconds staring at their old tree before he gave up. Whatever happened, he would not understand it this way.

He put the tree to his back and began walking.

Four minutes and thirty eight seconds later, the path disappeared. Sal peered at the ground in front of him, then at the hills around him, trying to tie what he was seeing with his memories of the forest.

They were... wrong— the hills, not his memories. He'd been exploring the forest with Roland for years, and even without the trees he should have been able to tie his memories to the topography around him.

And he could, sort of. Just not all of it. There were entire hills missing, as though they'd been scoured clean or somehow collapsed. It took him a long time — forty eight seconds — to realize that every hill which remained had on it a Whitewood somewhere.

In fact, as he analyzed it further, he realized there tended to be a kind of sphere of influence around each Whitewood, beyond which the topography simply flattened. Those hills with more Whitewoods retained more of the geography he was familiar with.

And... it still changed nothing about what he had to do. Yet the realization had deposited a coal of dread in his stomach. There were no Whitewoods near town.

He continued to walk, trying his best to follow known landmarks. Yet the further he walked, the flatter everything became and fewer landmarks could be found.

When the Whitewood disappeared completely, Sal began counting time.

It was hard. Even with his reduced speed, he could calculate the how long it should take him to reach town from where he'd been. But he wasn't walking across the same topography. How much shorter did it take to go through a hill than over one? He had no idea.

Moreover, he was pushing through ash that often came up to his knees. That slowed him some, but not always consistently, and he was sure it was messing up his calculations.

At some point, he realized he didn't care. He just kept walking, counting time in a kind of effortless meditation. It was a thing he could know, possibly the only thing he could know, and he clung to it.

Forty seven minutes of walking and his foot hit something solid. Curious, he crouched down and began digging through the ash until he found a small wooden ring, three fingers in diameter, seemingly embedded into the ground. It took three minutes and twelve seconds to excavate around the ring and find what it was anchored to: a tiny thread of wood that followed in the direction of the ring's aperture.

Graetech.

He stood slowly and looked around, only now noticing there was a pattern to the mounds of ash around him, the slow rise and fall matching the approximate footprint print of a row of homes. The ring would have been part of the water supply, helping feed water to the richer homes.

Larstead was gone. That where he stood.

Sal blinked several times to make sure. He double checked the valley but it didn't exist anymore. He then checked the ridges beyond and the location of the mountains in the distance. Those were still right, at least. But around him was nothing. No grass, no trees, no bell tower, nothing. The only hint that a town once stood here was mounds of ash, already disappearing as the wind carried it away.

He sat down.

He should cry. It would be the proper thing to do. His father hated it when he cried, and more than one bruise had come from failing that simple directive. Yet if ever anyone should cry, now would be it. Roland was dead. His father was dead. Everything he'd known was gone. Yet all he felt an empty hole gaping inside him.

After five minutes and forty-five seconds of sitting, he started to feel stupid. His town was gone, obliterated by who knows what, and he was sitting in the ash staring at nothing. He had no food, no water, no provisions of any kind, and no way of getting any.

A person could easily go a week without food, even under demanding conditions, but barely three days without water, and by the second they'd be capable of very little. His father had demonstrated both these truths to him several years ago in a lesson he would never forget, although that was true about most of his father's lessons.

His biggest concern was water. The nearest town was at least a week's walk and he didn't know where to find water. The stream he frequented with Roland was in the wrong direction, and he doubted it was drinkable anyway, if it was even there anymore. He didn't know how the town got its water. A well probably, but that'd be little more than a hole in the ground now.

Sal stood, turned, and walked away from the only home he'd ever known.

----

He found water the next day, early in the morning, one hour and twenty-two minutes after he woke up. The night's chill had buried deep into his bones, but the sun was on his back now, bringing warmth to stiff limbs. The landscape was desolate, but maybe not quite so desolate as before, if only barely, or perhaps he was imagining it. Hope did weird things; it could not be trusted.

The water was anything but a good sign. He struggled to identify it as a river, but it was certainly larger than a stream. It looked deep and it was brown.

He knelt beside it, cupped his hand, and brought the water up. It swirled with black and brown. There was no way he could drink this. It would kill him quicker than thirst. He let go of it with regret.

His next problem was the river — and he decided it was one — was in his way. He was certain there must have been a bridge but if so, there was no longer any sign of it.

Small pieces of wood and debris floated in the water, occasionally bobbing up or back out of view. None of it was large, the largest limited to the size of his hand. Yet it gave him hope that the whole world hadn't turned to ash. He'd begun to fear it had.

He tried to think of a way across the river, his mind churning and discarding ridiculous ideas in rapid succession. Every possible idea required materials he didn't have. They also required experience he didn't have— he'd never built a bridge before and had no idea where to even start. Rope would have been nice, but he had nothing to fasten it to. It was too wide to jump and while following the river might yield narrower straights, it would take him away from his goal and he doubted it would ever become narrow enough to jump. Swimming was the only possibility he could think of.

Roland would have already been on the other side, dripping wet, with a smirk on his face and some witty taunt on his lips. His friend always preferred experiential learning over thinking things through. The idiot would jump off a cliff just to see how tall it was.

Sal sighed. In this case, his friend was right. Swimming was the only option.

Sal hesitated, looking twice again at the river. He had no idea how deep it was— he'd never travelled this far, and even had he known the original river, assuming there was one, he'd still not know how much it had changed since... whatever happened, the death of all things, apparently.

So he did the only rational thing a person could do. He walked to river and dug a mark with his foot. He then walked twenty paces down stream and dug another mark. He stood center between his two marks and began watching the various flotsam drift downstream, counting the seconds it took for them to move between the marks.

He didn't bother trying to calculate the speed. It was moving fairly fast and that was enough. However, five minutes of watching revealed an interesting dynamic. Not all flotsam was the same. There were larger pieces, but they hid mostly under the water. Some of them closer to small logs with only branch stubs sticking out. Those pieces were moving much faster.

There was a undercurrent and it was strong. If he wasn't careful he would get dragged under, and with a fractured arm he might not make it back up.

He spent eight more minutes trying to think of any other solution but in the end swimming was the only option. Still, he could be smart about it.

Roland would have quite literally jumped as far as he could and then thrashed his way to the other side, ending up far downstream and probably missing a shoe in the process. He would then triumphantly declare his endeavour a complete success— he never liked that shoe anyway.

Sal walked to the edge where ash and dust turned to mud, then sat down, trying not to think about how he was further ruining his already disastrous clothing. Slowly he scooted himself into the river feet first, keeping them as high up in the water as he could. He anchored his hands in the mud to prevent himself from drifting downstream.

Once he was a few paces in, he drew in as much breath as he could and lay back, trying to float as much on top of the water as possible. The current quickly began pulling him down stream as he used a modified back stroke to swim while keeping is arms out of the undercurrent.

He was strongly tempted to fight the current, but that would be stupid. Whatever little time he could gain from that effort would be nowhere near as effective as simply making it to the other side and walking back. So instead, he simply swam as quickly as he could to the other side.

He almost made it without issue. There was an irony in that what got him wasn't his idea or carelessness, it was his clothes. More specifically, it was Roland's oversized, albeit well made clothes. The closer to the center of the river he got, the more the undercurrent began pulling on the extra cloth. It wasn't much and while it bothered him he could effectively ignore it...

Until a rather large log snagged his clothes and rolled, pulling him under the river.

Water invaded his lungs. He coughed instinctually but that filled his lungs with more water. He thrashed and fought but it only seemed to embed the broken stub deeper into the cloth. He kicked, trying to roll the log back over but it refused. He wasted several seconds trying to unbutton just the top button of his shirt, but even if he hadn't had a broken forearm, he still wouldn't have managed it. He clawed at the clothes next but they wouldn't budge and it was then he realized he was panicking.

He forced the panic down and stilled himself. Carefully, he reached behind him and began to feel at the cloth, trying to find where it snagged. But the voluminous attire kept thwarting his attempt, interjecting folds and false leads.

His head began to feel light while his pains felt distant. Even the burning in his lungs began to feel at a remove. He was dying.

His fingers came across the edge of cloth and wood. He pulled at it and suddenly he was floating free. He clawed at the water, ignoring the blossoming pain in his arm. He had no idea which way was up but neither was he in a place to consider. He just clawed in a panic until his face broke the water.

He spewed out water while trying to orient himself. By luck he was only a few paces from the shore. He desperately kicked himself toward the shore until he was wading in mud. He tried to crawl, but the sharp pain in his arm caused him to collapse. He rolled onto his back as a coughing fit took over.

He lay there for twelve minutes, eyes closed, a soft moan escaping his lips as his head and arm assaulted him with pain.

Eventually, the sun began to feel hot, reminding Sal of where he was. He rolled over, pushing his face half in the mud, then pushed up with his good arm. He managed to rise to his feet after slipping a few times.

He glanced at the water once, then put his back to it and walked, his shoes squishing as he went.

----

The night was cold, but Sal felt hot. He was certain it was the water. He'd come across two more streams and both were foul. That last one had strongly tempted him. He almost convinced himself it looked clearer than the others, almost had fooled himself into drinking it. But again, it was his father's lessons that saved him. A lack of water might kill you, but drinking bad water will do it quicker.

He wasn't stupid. He didn't drink the water. But he had swum in it, and he had done so with open wounds. He wanted to curse himself as a fool. He should have known better, but there really was no other option.

He could only hope he woke up in the morning. At least he had no trouble falling asleep.

----

Sal woke up with the sun stinging his eyes. He felt both hot and cold. His mouth was made from paper and no matter how he worked it he couldn't manage more moisture than a thick paste.

He didn't bother to take stock of himself. He'd felt this before. He was sick and feverish and he knew it. He could barely stop shivering. He needed rest and food and water and medicine.

Instead, he got up and walked. That alone would be his salvation, if such a thing were possible. He would walk until he found salvation, or he would walk until he died.

He crossed another stream, then turned to stare at it. For a moment, he thought he might have already crossed it. Fever could do strange things to the mind, but so far he hadn't lost time, that immutable of the world engrained into him so thoroughly. No, it looked the same because they all did.

He continued on, walking in a sun that beat down relentlessly. He shivered, cold.

After three hours he realized he was on a road, or what he thought was one. In truth, it was little more than where a road should be if there was one. It was a guess, but it was all he had.

He stared at it for twenty three seconds, double checked the mountains were behind him, and started walking again.

He collapsed a couple hours after noon. He didn't remember collapsing, only waking up, face down in the middle of the road. His body hurt, and his muscles had a deep ache he thought couldn't be from walking. Even dehydration shouldn't produce ache so bad, not yet at least.

He pushed himself up and walked.

The days had grown progressively hotter without a forest to cool things off. That's why the sun was hot. The thought spun around in his head for a while, but yet again it felt like useless trivia. He watched the heat waves ripple above the ground. It didn't matter why the sun was so hot; it just was and his own fever added to it.

He looked for Roland's trees in the hope he might find shade, yet the Whitewoods had disappeared, or perhaps they only grew on the other side of Larstead. Either way, there was no relief from the heat.

Perhaps that was a good thing. He wasn't sure he could convince himself to get back up after resting under a tree.

Toward the end of the day, he began to notice the remains of debris. Stripped trunks, large rocks, branches would dot the landscape. Occasionally, he would smell something long dead and vile, but that was rare.

He dreamed of water, crystal clear and cool. He walked and walked, thinking only of the next stream.

The foul smells increase but he barely noticed. He passed another stream and stared at it. His stomach ached; his tongue cracked; the stream was...

He knelt down and put his hands in dirty water. The smell... he remembered the smell of death and removed his hands. It would kill him.

He tried to swallow and felt his tongue bleed.

He got up and he walked.

He sat down sometime later and leaned against a large boulder that had somehow been spared. The sun only just touched the horizon, still enough light to walk another hour. He should walk. He could hear his father's voice admonishing him, belittling his lack of will. He had a weak will, he knew. His father had made that clear enough. But he did know how to do simple things well.

Sal got up and walked.

It was dark when he collapsed again.

----

Sal woke up too late. He should have gotten up earlier. He felt panic as he realized he hadn't stood at attention for his hour.

Then he remembered his father was dead. Everyone was.

He got up and stood. His eyes watered and he couldn't focus on anything. No matter how he tried, the world remained fuzzy.

He walked anyway.

His feet had blisters and the bone ached. He wasn't quite sure when that happened, but they made it difficult to walk correctly. He kept stumbling as he tried to walk in a way that wouldn't hurt the blisters. He fell a couple times, and decided he should focus on something else. The blisters wouldn't go away, but he could still walk.

Most people didn't realize there was a correct way to walk. They just did what their body told them to. But there was a correct way. His father had shown him, and then drilled him until he could walk correctly. Like standing, it took practice and dedication or, as his father liked to put it, proper motivation.

His father was very good at giving Sal proper motivation.

Sal made certain he walked correctly. The blisters got worse, but he was good at doing the simple things. He could make it.

----

The afternoon yielded yet another stream. Sal almost dove for it. He drank it without checking or caring how dirty it was. He drank until his stomach hurt.

He spent the next five minutes throwing it all back up.

He'd forgotten that particular lesson. Drinking too much, too quickly, can kill you, especially when dehydrated. Drinking the wrong water can kill you. Not drinking enough water will kill you. He'd almost drowned in water two days ago... three days?

Sal stumbled, frowning. How had he spent his life so unaware of how dangerous water was?

He crawled back to the stream and drank more, but only a little, only enough. He didn't check the water. It didn't matter. Fever ravaged his body and water was the only salve.

Water might be dangerous, but it was life.

Sal got up and walked.

----

He threw up later that evening. There was blood in it. It took thirty-three minutes and twelve seconds to stop. Then, after nine minutes, he started dry-heaving again, bringing up an occasional bout of more blood. After that came the diarrhea, but by then it was a relief from throwing up.

Sal admitted to himself he was dying. Was it the water, or did he simply lack the will? He couldn't decide. His father would tell him he lacked the will to live, but he was pretty sure it was the water.

He still had at least three hours of walking left in the day.

He stood, wavered on his feet, took a single step, then collapsed.

He tried three more times before he realized that there was nothing he could do. He'd failed at walking, the simplest of things. In the end, his father had been right. He was worthless, not capable of doing the simplest thing correctly. He wanted to apologize, but his father would never accept it. He had never been a good son. He'd never made his father proud like sons were supposed to do.

Roland had made his dad proud. He knew this, saw it in the man's eyes when he looked at his son. Sal had no idea how Roland had done it. If he did half of what Roland did, he'd been thrown out on his ear. But somehow, Roland did it. And Roland would walk, because sons who made their fathers proud did things right.

Sal pushed himself to his feet, wavered, took a step, then another. One more time, he told himself. Only one more time. He would take this next step, then another. He couldn't fail at this simple task. Not this, not with something so simple like walking.

Sal collapsed again when the sun touched the horizon. He only needed one more hour. Only one. That's it. If he could walk only those steps, he would have done it. He'd have succeeded at walking.

He tried to open his eyes but they refused. They felt thick and heavy, glued shut. He tried to push himself up regardless, but arms shook violently at the effort.

He was face down, in the dirt, in the middle of the road. He should have moved. He should move. He should sit under a tree and die with dignity. Not like this. Not face-down in the dirt.

He tried one more time to get up, then collapsed. He didn't rise again.
