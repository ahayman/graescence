# 81 | Duel

Roland dropped his shield and replaced his knife. It was clear that Fin needed something to respect, and even should Roland lose this duel, he wouldn’t do so without earning that respect. Besides, if Fin was that good with the sword, Roland was curious as to how he’d fare against him. He’d never sparred with anyone except Rose and, of course, he’d never won, ever. As Roland tried to stand up, Anna grabbed his hand.

“You really don’t have to.”

“It’s fine.” He tried to give her a reassuring smile as he let a disgruntled Skyra down to the ground. “It’s just sparring.”

Anna sighed but sat back with a dangerous look in her eyes. “Careful Fin. You hurt him, I hurt you.”

“Possessive much?” Fin swung his practice sword around a few times as Roland picked up his own.

He looked at the training sword. It was a little shorter than he was used to, middling between a short and long sword, a bastard then. It wasn’t weighted to mimic gravtech, which made it feel airy. Not his preference, but more than serviceable. He swung the sword for a few practice swings, careful not to do anything too advanced that might reveal his skill.

Surprise was ever the best advantage, and deceit the very essence of battle.

Roland took a moment to remove his coat, which was too hot by the fire anyway. Anna’s eyes immediately flickered to his brace of knives and widened slightly. Her breath quickened as he carefully removed his harness and set it on his coat, as it was against dueling rules to carry other weapons into a match. After a few seconds, the harness collapsed on itself with the loss of its stored energy.

He shifted his consciousness into the empty, and moved into a relaxed, but ready non-stance. He specifically chose it because it was a kind of stance he had developed that didn’t look like anything known. It had started out as a kind of game he played with Rose, trying to find something that wasn’t a stance and yet still positioned such that Rose couldn’t actually find anything wrong with it. Rose hated it, calling it sloppy, yet unable to find anything wrong as he corrected every small misalignment. Roland was eager to try it on someone else.

Roland waited for Fin to adopt a stance, but instead, the man decided to strike unbalanced from the Roland’s left. He almost couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The move was telegraphed almost ages in advanced. A dozen options flittered through his head, most of them ending with Fin on the ground, disabled or otherwise in a fair amount of pain. That alone threw up warnings in his head, so h. e opted for the simplest solution.

With barely any effort, Roland shifted his weight, leaned back, and allowed Fin’s weapon to barely miss him. Expecting a counter attack, Fin jumped back. He looked mildly surprised at the miss.

It hadn’t been but a few seconds, and already a crowd had gathered to witness their spar. He might have suspected Fin told some of them in advance, but in truth, he didn’t know how groups of people worked. Maybe this was normal. At least he’d give them some entertainment if nothing else.

Fin danced and began to circle Roland, forcing him to rotate in kind. He doubted his stance fooled Fin anymore, but he kept it up for appearance’s sake. If nothing else, he thought it looked good. Fin had yet to adopt a stance. Perhaps his ‘mastery’ was all bluster. So far, nothing he’d seen impressed him.

Fin telegraphed his attack as he came in again but this time with an unbalanced thrust. Roland almost shook his head in disappointment, but he didn’t want to offend his hosts. Instead, he shifted his foot and balance just enough to twist out of the way without unbalancing himself in the process. The attack missed by less than a finger’s width, though in the world of duels that might as well have been a league.

The attack was a clear overreach and easily avoided. Roland had expected Fin to be unbalanced but instead he followed through by taking a few steps forward and shifting his weight so he was once again facing Roland with no sacrifice to his balance. Roland was mildly impressed at the maneuver. It looked like an over-reach but wasn’t, just like Roland’s stance didn’t look like one but was. Both were an invitation to their opponent to underestimate them. Had Roland tried to counter it, Fin may very well have managed the first hit.

Roland continued to feel Fin out. He had long since learned that any attack was a risk, more so when you know nothing of your opponent. He would have to be wary of carefully planned openings in the future, but it wasn’t anything Rose hadn’t tried hundreds of times. Compare to her, Fin was acting like a rank amateur.

He gave Fin a slightly bored look.

Fin actually growled and finally entered a stance. Roland breathed a sigh of relief.

Fin’s stance was aggressive, but that wasn’t surprising. He seemed the type. Roland tended to favor balanced positions that provided decent retreat options, no doubt a product of dealing with an opponent so far beyond his skill who literally required that he attack or else suffer pain for timidity.

A fair amount of the camp had gathered by now with most of the rest looking on from afar. Their eyes bore into his back until it itched. Instinct kept screaming at him to prevent them from flanking him.

Fin immediately excecuted a familiar flurry of attacks that Roland parried and dodged but otherwise avoided countering. He felt no need no need to commit to an attack yet.

At least it was real sparring, no matter how predictable the patterns were. The fact that Fin knew the attack patterns told Roland he’d had some serious training. It also meant Fin was feeling Roland out just as much as he was doing the same and confirmed his suspicions that Fin’s unbalanced attacks were designed to expose Roland’s abilities.

An involuntary smile reach his lips at the thought. Maybe it would be a decent challenge after all.

At his smile Fin shifted his stance yet again. It was an even more advanced stance than the last one, though equally aggressive. Roland decided to abandon the non-stance he’d been using and shift into something more balanced.

Fin attacked with a flurry of strikes and thrusts that Roland dodged or blocked flawlessly, yet still he avoided countering. He would eventually need to attack, and soon, but for now he needed to understand more of what Fin was capable of.

About half way through an attack pattern, Fin shifted his stance mid-attack and cut off into a new pattern. Roland failed to account for it, and Fin’s attack stuck his left shoulder hard. Roland felt and dismissed the pain immediately. He stuck that hand into his pocket, a signal that he accepted Fin’s strike as valid. From here on out, he couldn’t use it.

It was something Rose had deeply instilled into him, often ‘disabling’ a limb on purpose to force him to adapt. Only once did he try to use an arm after it had been ‘disabled.’ She broke it, then forced him to continue through the pain. That had been a painful lesson.

Fin jumped back and looked disturbed. Not only had Roland avoided most of his more advanced techniques, but he’d accepted a hit like a duelist without even a grunt for the pain. It was evident this had rattled Fin, but Roland wasn’t sure why.

Sparring was very much like playing a game of chance. Expressions, bluffing, feints, and deception were just as much part of it as the clash of swords. This became especially important when your opponent was so much better than you were, and so Roland had become an expert at deciphering his opponent’s tells or, at least, he’d become an expert at reading Rose’s tells. He wondered now just how much the lack of diversity had harmed him.

Bolstered by success, Fin began another aggressive pattern of attacks. Just as Roland recognized it, Fin shifted his stance in the middle of an attack and switched to another. He didn’t wait long before shifting into yet another stance, abandoning the prior sequence for a new one, yet flowing from one to the other with the grace of a dancer. He continued in this manner, flowing from stance to stance, shifting his attack patterns so as to make predicting what he would do impossible.

It was incredibly impressive and at that moment Roland knew true admiration for the man. No matter his mood or temperament, Fin had most certainly earned his skill.

Yet not one other attack struck Roland.

Throughout all of this, he’d had been mapping the man’s movements, consuming and digesting every bit of information he could glean. Before too long, he began anticipating what he would do from subtle shifts in his stance, movements of the man’s torso, or even twitches in his shoulder. After he’d built up enough of a map, he shifted his weight and began to attack for the first time.

In truth, Roland didn’t use attack patterns. He couldn’t. Though Rose had taught him ever-advancing patterns, she always followed it by systematically destroying them in turn. Unlearning the patterns had been as important as learning them, and this became the very essence of how he learned to fight. Patterns were synonymous with predictability and, as she so aptly would demonstrate, inherently entwined with loss, failure, and pain. So no, Roland didn’t use attack patterns.

Instead, he used his attacks to complete the map of Fin he’d been constructing in his head. Once that was done, it was a simple matter to use the map to deconstruct the man.

Throughout all of this their practice swords had become a blur as they shifted positions, either giving or gaining ground, slowly circling each other. The night air was filled with the sound of loud clacks at their weapons formed a symphony of concussion accompanied only by the fire’s crackle.

It had become the only sound that filled the night.

He began a new series of attacks designed first to position Fin where he wanted him. He’d constructed his map, and it was time to end it. This whole time, he’d also been feeding Fin incorrect tells by shifting his weight slightly over his right foot for certain attacks. Doing this made it appear he was slightly off balance, inviting Fin to overreach to take advantage. By combining the tell with a particularly aggressive attack, Fin would react by overreaching enough for Roland to shift his own attack beyond the man’s guard.

To take advantage of it, Roland abandoned his own balance and moved completely under Fin’s attack. There was little risk at this point, for he knew where Fin would be. He stepped in and down, swinging his foot out and striking Fin’s lower leg hard enough to send it out from under him. At the same time, he came up with his own weapon under Fin’s sword arm and struck it hard enough to send the man’s weapon flying up into the air at the same time his legs flew out from under him. He completed the maneuver by swinging the sword back down to rest on Fin’s trachea as his back struck the ground.

A collective gasp drew Roland’s attention to the surrounding crowd. He was in the middle of a circle of people that must have contained the whole camp.

Fin’s practice sword struck the ground next to his head. Roland looked down at him, his own weapon still at the man’s throat, and immediately removed it. He bent over and offered his hand both to help him up and as a sign of no aggression. Fin looked at his hand with a parted mouth, and for a moment, Roland thought he wouldn’t take it.

Fin reached, and their hands clasped. It felt like a moment, or Roland hoped it was.

He pulled Fin up and waited. The camp remained silent as Fin stared at Roland with an unreadable expression on his face. Roland began to feel worms of unease eat their way through him as he began to suspect he’d screwed up somehow. Was he not supposed to win the match? Everyone around him was silent, watching and waiting, but Roland’s eyes were glued to Fin’s. He started seeking around for anchors, ready to escape should this turn bad.

A single laugh burst from Fin. He shook his head in wonder and chuckled. He kept chuckling and his laughter grew until he almost wheezing. He doubled over with tears rolling down his face.

“Damn boy, I don’t think I’ve sparred like that since my own master beat me the day I left.”

“A surprise, indeed,” Alistar said as he stepped into the circle, a wary look on his face. “You have the makings of a Royal but not the bearing. The weapons of one but not the cloths. The training of one, but not the arrogance. Where did you learn to spar like that?”

Roland felt a deep-seated unease as he realized his mistake in accepting Fin’s challenge. It seemed his every move revealed more than he intended. Reveal too much and they might just start asking about Rose.

“I was trained.”

“Yes,” Alister nodded, then waited, but Roland had nothing more to say. The truth was far worse than any story they could concoct, making silence his best reply. Alister eventually seemed to come to a conclusion. “You’re not a Royal, but were you trained by one?”

“No.”  She hated the Royals.

But the question stuck him odd. Was Rose a Royal? She was an immortal, an Elder, certainly, but he hadn’t considered her beyond that. It wouldn’t surprise him if she were a Royal from the prior empire. That was a theory he’d long considered, not that he had any proof, not that it mattered.

“Mysteries abound with you.”  Alister seemed to consider a moment but then turned and left without a further word. As he did, so also dispersed most of the spectators, each to their concerns but with the night’s entertainment on their lips.

Roland looked around and caught Anna staring at him, eyes filled with something he couldn’t identify. It made him feel more than a little like prey.

A clap on his back brought him out of his revelry with a startled jump.

“Stop looking so constipated.” Fin said, “You have nothing to worry about here. Nobody’s gonna knife you in the back... well, except maybe Anna.”

Roland gave Fin a sharp look of alarm, only to be met by a mischievous grin. “Naw, I’m just kidding. Sort of. She _does_ carry an obscene number of knives, something you should be wary of in the future.”

Roland glanced over at Anna, who was walking toward them. He could see no sign of knives on her at all which was disturbing in itself given how form fitting her jacket was. He began to re-evaluate just how dangerous she might be, for he’d long since learned that the greatest danger was the one he never saw coming.

“So that attack pattern you used at the end?”

Roland drew his gaze back to Fin with some difficulty. He felt disoriented by the man, who’d had a complete turn of attitude. He would have thought he’d gotten used to that with Ellie, but apparently not.

“It wasn’t really a pattern.” Roland’s eyes drew back to Anna as she joined them. She made him uncomfortable now in several respects, most of which he couldn’t explain.

“Not a pattern?”

Roland shook his head. “Ro... uh, my master taught me patterns, but as soon as I’d learned one, she’d systematically tear it apart every time I tried to use it.”

“She?” Anna said with a raised eyebrow. Roland’s heart began to race.

“Huh, my own master insisted I learn how to combine the patterns, adapting them and switching them as needed.”

Roland shrugged. “Patterns are death.” He really couldn’t see any knives on her. Perhaps that’s why she made him feel so uncomfortable. She was that dangerous. Her lips twitched again.

“That’s ah... pretty extreme.”

Roland drew his brow together and turned back to Fin. “Why? As soon as you use a pattern, you become predictable. The moment your opponent knows your next move, they own you.”

“Just because you’re using a pattern doesn’t mean you can’t defend. And if you’re switching them up, your opponent may only think they know what comes up next.”

Roland gave him a wry smile. “You mean like when I hitch my shoulder before I thrust?”

Fin’s face fell. “You were doing it on purpose.”

“Your response was predictable, and you overreach to take advantage of it, allowing me behind your guard.”

“Yeah, I noticed _that_ a little late, but it was the only tell I could find.”

“I shouldn’t have any tells.” He’d always thought that having a tell was amateurish.

“No tells? I doubt that.”

“She was very thorough about beating that out of me.”

“She beat you?”  Anna’s eyes had narrowed on Roland, and he suddenly felt caught in a trap he couldn’t see.

“That’s not... no, it’s just training.”

Anna looked to believe that as much as if he’d said he flew here on a winged unicorn. And that was startlingly close to the truth.

Fin’s eyes flicked back and forth between them. “So, let’s see if we can find you a tent for the night.”

Roland quietly let out a relieved sigh and followed after Fin. Anna simply watched them leave with a thoughtful, calculated look on her face.

Fin led Roland around the bond fire to a small tent set a little ways back. The tent was surprisingly large, enough to fit two people easily with some gear. It seemed to be made up of a dark-green canvas that Roland assumed was water proofed. It’d been newly set up by the scuffs around it, and the tent flaps had been tied open, facing out toward the fire.

Fin presented the tent with a flourish of hands. “We have plenty of tents nowadays. I’d recommend you get some good sleep, though.” His eyes flicked back to Anna. “Tomorrow we’ll be scouting again.”

“I’ll be going with you?”

“I’d bet my best coin on it. You’ve proven you can handle yourself, and we need scouts more than anything right now.”

Roland looked back at the tent. He felt out of place and more than a little deceitful knowing he had a home to return to should he want it. Yet he’d not go back. He didn’t know these people, not really, but they were real. They were people, and they quenched a thirst he’d buried for years. Now that he’d had a taste, he couldn’t imagine not drinking his fill.

He entered the tent, closed and tied the flaps together, and undressed himself down to his small cloths. They’d provided him with a pillow, a mat, and a sleeping bag. He idly mused that this might be the best sleeping arrangement he’d ever managed in the forest.

He carefully removed the knife from his trousers and placed it under the pillow. Not quite as good as a door jam, but at least it was in reach. He laid on top of the sleeping bag, hands behind his head, as he watched the light of the bonfire dance across the canvas. His mind spun in a hundred directions that resolved nothing, and darkness took him before he realized he’d fallen asleep.
