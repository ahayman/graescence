# 57 | Rotaka [Sal]

Sal gasped awake when large hands shook him. A pair of eyes stared at him from within the dark. He startled and scrambled back against the wall. The eyes tracked him but didn't follow.

Three seconds later, Sal's eyes had adjust well enough to see the person before him.

"Djrek? Dammit..." he grumbled and threw the sheets off him as he swung his legs over the bed's edge. His feet didn't touch the floor.

"Come," Djrek's baritone voice filled the room, "you'll want to see this."

Djrek's outline blotted out the door, then disappeared.

Sal rubbed the sleep from his eyes, grabbed his shirt off the nightstand, placed it beside him, and pulled on his shoes absently. His heart was still racing almost as fast as his mind. Had he locked the door? He wasn't sure. If not, then he'd been insanely stupid. Yes, he was supposed to be bait, but that didn't mean leaving the door wide open. That was just... a lesson to be learned.

That's what it was. A lesson. He dropped his head into his hands. Even if he had locked the door, he needed something else. A trap? Or a warning perhaps, so that no one could just walk in and scare the living shit out of him.

He shrugged on his shirt, foregoing the buttons, and stumbled out into the narrow hallway, arm stretched out to the wall. Djrek was nowhere to be seen. He stared down the dark hallway dimly lit, then turned back toward his room. For a moment Sal questioned whether he'd dreamt it.

Whatever, he was awake now.

He staggered his way down the hall, unstable mostly from sleep. By the time he made it to the stairs, he'd found enough of his balance that he didn't need the wall anymore. There wasn't much sway anyway with a ship that speared waves, though what little there normally was seemed absent.

He emerged into a moonless night filled with stars. The deck could hardly be seen and beyond he could only make out the railing, against which was the outline of a Djrek sized man. So, not a dream.

He made is way to him and leaned on the railing. The sea was still, belying the speed at which the Inquisitor's ship moved.

"You see that?" Djrek gestured ahead and to the right toward a light patch of the sky.

"The sun?" Sal frowned as he peered at it. Was it later then he thought?

"We're headed south."

It took Sal four seconds to realize the sun doesn't rise from the south. To be fair, it _was_ early.

"What it is?"

"Your new home."

That... made no sense. Sal looked over at Djrek. He couldn't make out enough of his face to register his expression, but his mentor seemed focused. Sal turned back to watch the light grow lighter until he heard light steps behind him.

"You didn't wake me," Ash said, then leaned against the railing on the other side of Sal.

"You were snoring."

Sal sensed Ash shift and he couldn't help but smile as he imagined the flat expression she was leveling.

"And it's not like you haven't seen this before," Djrek said dismissively, though Sal could hear his amusement.

"It never gets old."

"No. No it doesn't."

They fell silent and Sal focused back on the light, which was steadily growing brighter. He knew it wasn't the sun, but his mind insisted it must be with the way it seemed to rise from the horizon. After four minutes, he glanced over at Djrek, but the man seemed content to simply watch. So Sal settled his elbows on the railing and leaned, eyes trained on the not-sun rising from the horizon.

It was ten minutes before his mind gave up the whole sun rising thing. While the light grew brighter, it never did resolve itself into a burning glowing ball. Instead it seemed to flatten and spread out across the horizon.

After a fourteen minutes, shapes began to resolve as needles in the light distantly spaced from each other. He counted twenty six of them as they seemed to rise from the ocean itself.

"Spires, like Castel?"

Ash snorted and Djrek shifted. "Something like that."

Castel, the capital of Santonia, was said to have twisting white spires that pierced the sky itself. Supposedly, the base of such a spire would have been larger than Sal's entire town. It was one of the stories he'd long suspected had been embellished by adults seeking to wow young children. He hadn't realized that Rotaka had its own spires, though in retrospect it made sense given it was the capital of the Empire and not a province.

The spires continued to rise, slowly growing thicker at their base until the light thickened, then seem to resolve into what looked like strands of spiderweb that stretched between the spires.

"I don't understand."

"They're roads, of a sort," Djrek said.

"Between the spires?"

"Hmm."

Sal squinted and tried to see any detail, but there was none to see. What was the point? Why build roads in the air?

As more of the spiderweb rose from ground, the threads became numerous and thick, with other tiny structures suspended between them. There had to be hundreds of the smaller structures, but Sal couldn't understand what they were for. They seemed too small to serve any real purpose.

He glanced again at Djrek but the inquisitor had a aura to him, or perhaps it was his stance, that warned Sal against asking questions. Per usual, he wanted Sal to figure it out himself.

Sal yawned and rest his chin on his hands while he watched the spires spear up from the horizon ever so slowly.

And that was interesting. How fast were they going? Sal had watched the cliffs of Andriel disappear; it had taken eight minutes with how fast the ship had sped away.

Just eight minutes.

Sal stood up and leaned over the railing as suspicion grew. He stared not at the spires, but at the structures between them. A little closer now, they'd resolved into something other than just blobs of light. Some of them almost looked like small... miniature... castles?

His mind shifted perspective and he saw massive buildings, towers, mansions, castles. All built on roads suspended between spires that would beggar small mountains.

"No..."

Djrek turned to him with a smile. "You haven't seen the truth yet."

"That's not possible..."

"Is," Ash snorted. Then, "Oh! There she goes."

Sal turned back and couldn't hide a gasp as the spires were continued to rise from the ocean. The web of roads ended abruptly, shedding their light down on the spire shafts.

The darkness thickened as the spires continued to ascend into the sky, causing the base of the spires to disappear. He knew it was a trick of the mind, of his current perspective, but for two minutes the city of Rotaka wasn't tethered to the world. It instead floated, an impossible metropolis far above mortal concerns.

And still, the spires rose higher. The darkness below began to lighten into an angry, dirty red. Structures again rose from the ocean, shedding their light into the dark, but without the purity of the ones above. They appeared the same size as those tiny structures suspended between the spires, though perhaps taller. As they rose from the horizon, Sal recognized they must be buildings, and those buildings must represent a city much larger than anything he thought possible.

"There's a city below the city?"

Ash laughed. "Now that's an appropriate way to put it." She pushed herself off the railing, apparently done with the sights. "I'm going down to pack."

Sal watched her walk away while he tried to process what he'd seen. Not only was there a city suspended in a web of light above the other city, but each of those spires had to be a city its in own right.

Djrek hadn't moved, so Sal returned his attention to the spires. The sky had finally lightened, and the sun cast its light on the spire tips first, then slowly made its way down to illuminate more of Rotaka. As it did, Sal caught a glimpse of something further back from the other spires, unconnected to a web of light that was rapidly disappearing beneath the sun. When the sun reached it, he realized it was another spire, not so tall as the others, but thicker and hidden in shadow.

"The black spire."

"What?"

"Our spire."

"We have a _spire_?"

Djrek nodded. "Your home now."

Sal looked back and realized the spire wasn't hidden in shadow, but simply black, unlike the others which had a white tint to them. He suddenly felt very, very small.

"The black spire is the oldest of them all, we believe."

"You don't know?"

Djrek shrugged. "Perhaps some do, but I do not." He turned suddenly. "Come. We'll arrive in a few hours."

Sal watched him turn and go, glanced back at the Capital of the Rotakan Empire, then followed him.

---

It was the smell that caught Sal's attention first. Salt, dead fish, human waste, and sweat mingled in humid air. He tried to breathe through his mouth, but the air was thick enough to taste it without his nose being involved.

Sound came next, though it never approached the sheer assault the local odor had on the senses. The bray of animals, grumble of drajin, caw of seagulls, spiked a loud din of human voices and the sound of sloshing water. The seagulls drifted on currents, straddling the shoreline before they dove into water to snatch up from churning water morsels stirred up by ships.

The air shifted and he almost gagged as a strong smell of urine and rotten eggs assaulted him. He turned toward the next peer and saw a line of drajin being led out of the lower hold of a massive ship. They were being led back into an upper level, which had a second exit. From there, Sal saw the reptiles emerge with floating sleds attached to them. Their handlers were milling around in a large area in front of the peer, ready to take on their charge once it emerged.

Their ship had docked at a busy port alongside merchant barges of varying types. The docks were a chaotic bustle of motion backdropped by two and three story warehouses, all constructed with rough hewn wood. Beyond, the spires loomed as pale outlines, and of the city of light, little could be seen except as smudges in the sky.

"Come, we have our own business to attend," Djrek said from behind him. He walked on without waiting for a reply.

As usual the Inquisitors naturally created their own personal oasis amidst the chaos. They walked past several peers to a large building with a few horses secured outside to a long wooden rail, where a person was brushing them down. Notably, horses could be seen through open windows of the second and third floors.

Djrek disappeared inside, leaving Ash to watch Sal and he to watch the horses. It suddenly occurred to him why they were there.

He turned to Ash. "We're getting some of those?"

"Some of those?" She appeared amused. "That would be the point of coming here."

Sal took a step back. "But why?"

"Riding is better than walking."

Sal looked at her, then back at the horses. His legs twitched. "No."

She broke into a smile. "Oh come on. It wasn't that bad."

"That's okay. I'll walk." Sal eyed the horses askance.

"You don't want to walk unless you have to."

"Umm… no, thank you."

"It'll take us three days to get to the spires as it is, Sal. Longer if you walk."

Three days? Sal looked up to find the spires, but from here they looked like little more than dirtied smudges in the distance. He tried to understand the distances involved but failed. Still, three full days just to reach the city? Weren't they already in the city?

Djrek walked out leading three before Sal could figure out anything useful. Sal took a few steps back as the beasts approached.

Djrek tossed the reins of one horse to Ash, who caught it and began securing her satchel and bags to a series of straps laid across its hind quarters. She transferred items between two of the packs before they balanced.

Sal tore his eyes from her, then let out a squawk and jumped back from the head of a horse Djrek had marched right up to him.

Djrek held out an apple. "Here, give him one of these and you'll be best friends."

Sal looked at the apple, then the horse, then back at the apple.

"No, thank you." His voice came out as a high whisper.

"It's not going to bite your hand off."

Sal stared at Djrek, aghast at the blatant lie. The horse snorted, and pawed the ground, clearly upset. Sal took another step back.

An apple was pressed into his hand. He tried to pull away but Djrek guided it into the maw of death. Sal squeezes his eyes shut and let out a nervous sound as his hand was assaulted by wet lips and teeth. When the monster finally finished, he opened his eyes, fully expecting to see a bloody stump.

"You really don't like horses, do you?" Djrek had an amused look.

"Can't I just walk?" Sal said, dropping his now disgusting, slime-covered hand.

He shook his head. "No. You don't want to walk. Besides, we have bags."

"But can't we give the bags—"

"This isn't a walk across town, Sal. It's a journey, and you can't just hire porters to follow you."

"Well..." Ash wobbled her head.

"Let me rephrase: we're _not_ hiring porters just so we can waste an extra day walking."

"But we did it in Andriel!"

"Get on the horse. I'll help you up." Djrek's smile turned polite.

Sal opened his mouth, then closed it as he took in Djrek's expression. He walked over to side of the horse, staying well clear of the beast's head.

"Place your foot here, in the stirrup."

Sal raised his right foot awkwardly.

"The other foot, Sal."

"Oh."

"Good. Now grab hold here and jump up. Make sure you swing your leg clear of the horse. Don't kick it unless you want to be dragged down the street."

It took four attempts over six and a half minutes to get him on the horse which did not, he noted, drag him through the streets when he accidentally kicked it. It did jump and shy away, though, forcing Djrek to waste a full minute coaxing the horse back to Sal, who kept backing away.

"Relax your grip; don't jerk— okay Sal, let go of the reins. Here, hold them like this, _loosely_ Sal. Good... or better at least. Don't worry about guiding the horse; it'll follow us," Djrek said as Sal glared down at him, "and these are city horses so they won't bolt."

Nothing about that made Sal feel better but Djrek didn't care. Once he was sure Sal wouldn't fall— or jump —off, he turned to his own steed, mounted it, and set out. True to his word, Sal's horse followed without any prompting.

Unlike last time, there was no trotting or galloping or whatever horses did to reach their destination before nightfall while Sal clung desperately to a stranger's back. While the horses did move quicker than an idle stroll, it wasn't _that_ much quicker. Sal looked at the ground with longing.

It was a dirty, crowded city, and there was shit on the ground, a lot of it. And mud, or just mud? No, some of it was definitely shit — he could smell it —even if it was mixed in mud. Probably, it was from horses and drajin, but some of it...

Suddenly grateful to be off the ground, he reached down and patted his horse. The skin of the horse twitched under his hands, and Sal immediately jerked back. He slowly sat back up, uncertain if that was normal or not. He determined to touch the beast as little as possible.

To be fair, the shit seemed to trail off a good ways in. It was still there, just not as much as before and most of it blended in with the dirt. He attributed it to the constant stream of drajin entering and leaving port, grinding it all into a lovely brown paste.

Aside from the excrement on the street, the air itself was dirty, though it took him a few minutes to realize it. While the day was clear, and the spires could be easily seen in the distance, they appeared to rise directly out of a horizon made of smog... which was troubling. The air around him looked relatively clear, if not a bit odious, but if he couldn't even see the trunk of the spires, then plainly he was not breathing clean air.

There was also absolutely nothing he could do about it, so he turned his mind to other things, like the buildings.

Unlike Hontima or Andriel, there didn't appear to be any kind of theme to the buildings. Some were made of stone, others wood, while others used both. None of them conformed to any particular style. Warehouses gave way to businesses, which gave way to more warehouses, which were followed by store fronts. They often passed long lines of stands offering food that mixed spices with the overall stench of the city, something that confused his stomach greatly.

The people were equally disparate in dress, race, and station. While most were dressed plain, likely workers about their business, just about every style was mixed in, including many he'd never seen before. That wasn't surprising; he'd only been to two real cities, although compared to Rotaka they might as well been little more than small towns.

One style, though, kept catching his eye, partly for the impracticality of it, and partly because... well, he just really liked it. Most notable were the ornate coats with deep colors paired well with the darker skin of their bearers. They had wide lapels, high collars, contrasting buttons, and wrapped swallow tails. Worn mostly worn over tight vests, they were frequently paired with a matching hat, at least for the men— the women appeared to favor broaches and pins. They seemed restricted to the upper classes so far as he could tell and while they all conformed to a general style, not once did he see a design repeated.

Of course, there weren't many wearing such finery, and most who did tended to be carried on a type of ornate... sled?

"They're called palanquins," Ash said after Sal had asked Djrek.

Sal committed the word to memory as he watched one go by. A pair of guards preceded it, clearing the road, while a quad of thin but well dressed servants bracketed it, both steering and feeding it the graescence needed to keep it afloat several paces off the ground.

Djrek nodded. "You'll see a lot more of them as we approach the city center, but some Royals like to search for— Ash, what do they call it?"

"Port hunting."

"Hmmm... merchants will offer steep discounts to avoid the risk and cost of transporting their goods into the city."

That caught Sal's ear. "Risk?"

"It's anywhere from four days to two weeks to transport goods to the spires. That's a lot of city in which to loose your goods to less the scrupulous."

"Two weeks!? Wait... you mean, bandits?"

Ash snorted. "Or rival merchants."

"Really? In the city? Aren't there guards?"

Sal looked around and spotted several, or so he thought. Djrek followed his gaze and nodded.

"Ports are usually well guarded out of necessity— no ship would dock otherwise —but many districts don't have the funds or inclination to keep any sort of police force employed."

"And some districts _are_ the bandits," Ash said.

Sal frowned at her. She seemed oddly... happy. He turned back to Djrek. "Why?"

"Think of it this way," Djrek said, "A city this large can't be managed all at once anymore than the Empire can. So it's divided up into districts, many of which are larger than many cities, with all the politics and power mongering you'd expect."

"But if they're robbing merchants, wouldn't someone stop that?"

"Call them 'transportation fees,'" Ash interjected.

Djrek shook his head. "Depends on who you rob. Attack the wrong merchant and the district will experience a sudden change in leadership. Attack too many merchants and they'll simply avoid your district, which could either leave your poorer or, if you're unlucky, affect a richer district who just might decide your district needs a change in leadership."

Ash grinned. "Assassins are big business here."

Sal jerked, suddenly feeling very conspicuous sitting so high on his horse. With so many new sights, he'd all but forgotten that some people he didn't know wanted him dead for reasons he still didn't quite understand. And that the Inquisitors _wanted_ them to try to kill Sal so they could... extract information.

Neither Inquisitor looked particularly concerned, and Sal couldn't help but suspect that part of their true purpose for riding these beasts was to stand out. Sal began examining every person who came close now for an entirely different reason than their attire. Once again, he began wondering what assassins looked like; once again, he concluded they looked like everyone, or anyone.

Djrek gave no indication he noticed Sal's sudden look of paranoia.

"Transporting goods into the city center requires quite a bit of planning and money. Many larger merchants maintain relationships with the districts in exchange for safe passage."

"Also known as extortion," Ash added.

Djrek rolled his eyes. "It's cheaper to pay the fees, if for nothing but expedience. The districts know this and the smart ones keep it civil."

Sal paused his fervent people watching. "But wouldn't it be better for everyone if the districts didn't rob people?"

"Perhaps," Djrek allowed, "but getting there would require a figurative sea of blood, and consign millions to die in poverty."

Sal blinked slowly, cocking his head. "... what?"

Djrek paused, looking thoughtful, which told Sal he was entering into one of his teaching modes.

"Consider. Who would you save by changing the system?" Djrek asked.

Sal hesitated, quite certain the question was loaded. "The people who are being taken advantage of?"

"And who is that?"

"The merchants?"

"Are you sure?"

"Well... yeah. They have to navigate the city, pay the fees, risk being robbed..."

"All true, but do you think they do not pass those costs on?"

"I guess, but—"

"And if they pass those costs on, then who do you suppose pays for them?"

Sal blinked slowly. "...those who buy?"

"Indeed, and they are?"

Sal stared at him for two seconds before his eyes began tracking the people around them. He'd come up with an answer right away, but first answers weren't usually correct. He knew that, but his mind divided between paranoia and a half-hearted attempt to think through the question.

"The Royals?" he said after twenty three seconds.

Djrek dipped his head.

"But the Royals are in charge, right? So... why would the they want that?"

Ash chuckled and looked over. "Oh no, they don't, not at all."

"There have been several attempts over the centuries to reform the system," Djrek continued, "and every one ended in an uprising that had to be put down."

Sal frowned. "But wouldn't it be better for everyone?"

"Perhaps, yes, it would be better, but we can't just magically make it happen. You have to destroy the old system if you want to create a new one. It's an important lesson for an Inquisitor. There are many ways the Empire could be better than it is, but we have no way to bring about that change than to destroy the Empire, which would quite defeat the point."

Djrek turned forward, signalling the conversation's end. Sal watched him for a bit. The conversation had not sat well. It made sense— Djrek always made sense —and yet it also felt incomplete.

They travelled for hours, and still there was no end to the crowds. There were changes though, signs that the city was changing as they travelled. The buildings became shorter, never breaking two stories, and not all were well made. There became a clear separation between travelling commerce and the rest. The people were more common, their cloths worn, and much fewer guards or sometimes none at all.

At some point, the port city ended. There was no clear line of demarcation, just signs, realization made after the fact. Sal hadn't seen a guard in a while. The road became more fractured, with hole to avoid. The building weren't nearly as grand, having been whittle down into a loose collection of single-story structures with an occasional two-story thrown in randomly. Some seemed to be occupied, other used for store fronts, though there was very little to indicate which was which.

The frantic crowds had all but evaporated into loitering groups of people with nothing to do but watch with wary interest the trio making their way down the street. There were others travelling the road, of course, merchants mostly. Sal watched a single drajin drawn sled slow as one of the loitering groups pushed themselves off a wall and casually walked up. Sal couldn't make out their words as he passed them, but money definitely changed hands before the merchant was allowed to continue on.

Banditry, it seemed, wasn't just tolerated, it was a perfectly legitimate business operating in the light of day.

And yet another merchant with several sleds never stopped. It seemed random, who was stopped or not, yet deliberate. There was a system of rules in place that Sal couldn't see. Three hours later he realized what was going on when he saw another merchant get stopped. This one sweat profusely as one of the 'bandits' casually gestured back the way they'd come, then shrugged.

"Ah." Sal's brow lifted.

Ash looked over. "Figure it out already?"

"They let them go further in before asking for money. I bet it's a lot more too."

She nodded. "Is."

"But why stop only some?"

"Signals."

Sal blinked at her. "Huh?"

Ash watched him for a moment but didn't bother responding, though her lips were pinched in a tight smile.

"What she means to say," Djrek said, casting Ash an irritated glance, "is merchants can purchase tokens. Those are exchanged for right of passage when they first enter the district, usually a flag they tie to their sled."

"Why don't the merchants use guards?"

"Too expensive," Ash replied, "and somewhat pointless."

Djrek frowned at Ash, then shifted his attention to Sal. "It's cheaper to pay the tolls and piss off a district. Some of the larger ones will bring personal guards, but leave the rest at port. They usually have permanent arrangements with the districts—"

"Besides," Ash interrupted, "too many guards will make everyone wonder if _real_ banditry is worth the effort. Unless, of course, you're part of a Royal train. Nobody messes with them."

Djrek shifted in his saddle and levelled a polite smile at Ash. "Would you like to take over my protege's instruction?"

Ash returned his smile with a mock imperious look. "Oh, I'll let you know."

Djrek shook his head without bothering to reply. They'd entered what Sal took for as a town center of sorts. The dirt had given way to stone, or dirty stone. Actually, after a second look, Sal realized the road had always been stone. It was just swept here. The road also widened into a large roundabout, center of which was a large fountain. Nothing ornate, just a simple column spilling water into a pool twenty paces in diameter, though it appeared to be dying out. Around the edges were small shops and restaurants, between which a spattering of semi-permanent food stands had been setup. Aside from the fountain and the road, everything was wood. Worn but not dilapidated, with effort to keep it all reasonably clean.

Djrek led them to the fountain, slotting them between the merchants who parked their sleds around the fountain, allowing their drajin to drink while they grabbed food for themselves. Djrek took Sal, leaving Ash to tend the horses, and walked him to one of the nicer shops. It was a restaurant of sorts, but with only a few tables mostly unoccupied and a large counter neatly dividing the room in two. Above the counter was a neat list of foods and prices written in chalk, most of them sandwiches.

A middle-aged woman stood behind the counter, somewhat portly with a no nonsense look about her. A man stood before her on the other side but was finished up as they approached. He grabbed a paper wrapped sandwich, turned, and started with wide eyes at the sight on an Inquisitor standing behind him. He just about fled the store.

The woman barely flinched. "What can I..." she trailed off, noticing Sal gaze at a fan set on the wall, which was barely turning.

A distinctly annoyed, almost dangerous look flashed over her face. Her eyes narrowed. "Excuse me a moment, if you don't mind."

Djrek gave her a warm smile, "Certainly. Take your time."

She turned toward a door at the back. "Shri! _Shri!_"

She waited a moment, then cursed under her breath something about idiot boys. She cupped her hands around her face, and took a deep breath.

"_SHRI!_ Get yo lazy ass down here _now!_"

The sounds of feet thumping on wood came from above and trailed toward the back. A moment later a boy with dark brown skin came through the back door, holding a single shoe.

"_What_ mamma, I was jus—" He cut himself off at the sight of an inquisitor and his eyes grew comically wide. He started shaking his head vigorously. "I... I... I didn't. I swear. It was just an accident. We... we didn't mean— oh gods. Oh gods no—"

The boy Shri was descending into a full blown panic attack when his mom walked over and slapped him upside the head hard enough that Sal winced from the blow. His heart began to race, fists clenched.

"You didn't do _what_ now?"

"Nothin!" The boy seemed to get a hold of himself. "We did nothin. I swear."

"Uh huh, and your nothin has nothing do with that uproar last week? The one where the Ashren's home somehow magically lost a window?"

Shri's eyes darted between the Inquisitor and his mother. "...n no?"

Her eyes narrowed, then, "What I always tell you?"

He looked confused for a moment. "Uh... don't play with knives?"

Her brow shot up. "You been playin with knives!?"

"No," he shook his vigorously, "no ma'am."

He swallowed hard as she let the seconds draw out. Then she calmly reached behind her and pointed. He followed her gesture, spotted the fan, then seemed to deflate in relief.

"Oh."

"Yeah, 'oh'. How many times I gotta tell—"

"Right! Yeah," he glanced at the Inquisitor, "I'll do it now, momma. Like, right now."

"Damn right you will."

She glared at him as he fled the room, but the moment he was gone she doubled over wheezing. Sal stared in confusion as she stumbled over to the counter and put her head in one hand while the other slapped the counter repeatedly. It took Sal eight seconds to realize she was laughing.

She calmed down after twenty three seconds, took a deep breath, and then looked up. "I gotta thank you for that. Whatever you want, it's on the house. I swear, you may have set that boy straight for good. At the least, I daresay he won't be letting the fountain run down anytime soon."

Sal frowned, "the fountain?"

"Hmm," she waved at the fan, "it's on the same system. Let's me know when the fountain needs to be fed."

A few seconds later, the fan started to speed up. Sal turned to look behind him and, sure enough, the fountain looked to be bubbling up again.

"What can I get for you, all on the house, as I said."

Djrek, looking very amused, ordered three sandwiches. He handed one to Sal as they walked out.

"That was..." Sal glanced behind him as they walked.

"A reputation can be a fearsome thing. It's a good lesson."

"Yeah, but I mean, Inquisitors don't..."

"Apprehend errant boys who steal windows?" He chuckled. "No, we don't, and I'm sure that boy Shri will figure it out soon enough."

Sal opened the paper wrap and took a bit from the sandwich, frowning as he ate. He could recognize the humour but for one scene, which replayed in his mind over and over, the mom hitting her son upside the head, hard enough to leave a bruise. Yet there'd been no fear in Shri's eyes, not of his mother at least. All Sal could think was how he wished his father would have only hit him like that.

The rest of day passed mostly in silence while Sal brooded, though not so much dark as with gray, colorless thoughts. The city passed in a cadence of structures and spaces. At times they would pass wide green fields of grass, sometimes trampled, sometimes not. Sometimes he would see kids playing games, and perhaps some were even his age. Other times they passed through what amounted to town centers, or warehouses, or shops, or just long runs of homes. Sometimes they looked decent, other times run down. Never did it feel like they left the city, though, always in sight of the spires which ever dominated the horizon.

Toward evening they approached a larger commercial district that spread out over at least ten square blocks, with three and four story building of wood and stone. Mere months ago he would have called it a city in it's own right, almost incomprehensible compared to his village. Yet now it looked... small, inconsequential to the spires who cast shadows miles long from a setting sun.

They stopped near the center at a nice hotel, where their horses were taken away to be fed and watered, their luggage carried to their rooms as a service, and where they ate the best of food. Sal asked for string, which Djrek gave him without comment.

Sal got his own room, as usual. He made sure to lock the door this time, and checked it twice to be sure. The string he cut, wrapped around his book, and made into a kind of trap, where it would drop if the door opened. The window was harder, but he settled for tying the window latch together, hoping it would snap loud enough to wake him should anyone try.

He dreamt in grey, of the mother, hitting her child, with love in her eyes. But the dream changed, and it was of his father, beating him over and over because Sal tried to call him 'Pappa' instead of 'sir'. Yet the beatings never hurt; they were just... gray, as if beatings could be a lack of color. They couldn't hurt him— they could never hurt him.
