# 7 | A Dose of Reality [Dia]

Dia ambled about the small room as the details of the room's graetech trickled into her mind.

_A hot plate, a cold box, and,_ she glanced up, _lights that would work if there were something feeding them._

She kicked aimlessly at one of the piles of detritus in disappointment, then took several steps back from the cloud of dust.

"Damn," Malek said as he brushed himself off.

"It's not crush," Kalina replied a little too upbeat, as though covering disappointment. "Just means we've gotta work."

"And to be clear, by work you mean: not die."

Kali scrunched her face at him.

She'd been hoping the same thing they all had. They should have arrived beyond all the traps, the very place delving teams aimed for, the rooms with all the good stuff. Instead, they got a...

"Is this a break room?" Tait asked in genuine bafflement.

"Yeah," Moore sighed, "it happens."

"I...don't understand."

Dia snorted. _That must have hurt to admit._ "A break room is a room where people take breaks."

He dug his thumb and finger into the bridge of his nose. "I know what a break room is."

"Then why are you asking?"

"Why is a break room here, in the ruins?"

"Let me guess," she replied sardonically, "you think ruins are ancient treasure vaults?"

He clenched his jaw, refusing to answer.

"They're research facilities, Tait. You know, places where people come and—"

"I _know_ what a research facility is, dammit."

"Heavily guarded research facilities," Malek added, "with traps. And death bots. And—"

"We get it, Malek. It's dangerous," Kali snapped at him. "Do you want go home?

"No." He knelt at one of the piles and began to pick through it. "Just saying."

Dia walked to the door before her exasperation could get the best of her. Kali turned to Tait, painting more patience on her face than Dia could manage.

"Best we know," Kali said, "the ancients used all of this for research."

"So, it's not treasure?"

"Oh, it's treasure alright," Dia said, examining the door. A feed led to a retractable lock. Simple, but effective and, as usual, flawless in it's design. "Just not what you're thinking."

"Where do you think all our tech comes from?" Kalina continued.

"We...make it?"

"Well no—yes, I mean—"

"How do we know _how_ to make it?" Dia said, still facing the door. It was made of structural elderin but she was pretty sure it was hollow. It made sense, elderin was heavy, and virtually nothing could break even a thin piece of it. Even hollow, the design was overwrought.

"We just do?"

Dia turned and leaned back against the door, rolling her eyes. "No, that's...just no. The stuff we make is like a child's scribbles compared to the tech down here. We delve to learn."

"I thought we delved to make money."

"Yeah, of course," _except for me_, "but you do realize all of _our_ research facilities revolve around figuring out what these people have already done?" She gestured widely around her.

Tait gave her a blank look. No, not blank. More like suppressed anger at being lectured by a girl several years his junior. Worse, he didn't know what she was talking about and it was obvious. His hand clenched repeatedly.

Dia shook her head. "We're all stumbling in the dark, trying to recreate something these people mastered millennia ago. Our best artisans can barely make blue glass."

"No, we can make green."

"No," she shook her head, "Auris Mandrin was the last artisan to make green glass, and he took his secrets to the grave a decade ago. But these people?" She gestured again. "They made crystal. You get it?"

"Wait, what's crystal?" Malek asked, still rummaging.

"Clear glass," Moore rumbled.

Malek twisted his neck to look at him, then shrugged. "Whatever."

Dia could not let that go. "It's _not_ whatever. I don't think you understand what crystal really is."

"No, we're not getting in to this," Kali warned.

"It's perfection. It's clear because the graescent surfaces are so flawless they bend the entire light spectrum."

"Yeah," he chuckled, "like I said, whatever."

"Do you have any—"

"Dia," Kali interrupted, "we're here to delve, not lecture. Red, blue, yellow, clear; doesn't matter. Besides, it's not like anyone here will ever own glass."

Malek snorted. "Unless we score real big."

"And what," Kali turned to him, "you gonna blow your share on a piece of half-rate glass? Cause you know the Royals keep all the good stuff."

"Well, not when you put like that."

"All I'm saying is crystal is per—"

"Ha! Found one!" Malek said, pulling a hotplate from the rubble.

_Dammit. Why do I even try?_ Dia turned back to the door to study it for every last scrap of knowledge she could glean. All their prior delves were shallow enough that she'd never actually seen a door like this. Not that this one was special—it _was_ just a door.

Kalina looked at the hotplate doubtfully. "You know they sell those, right?"

"Not like this."

"You should save your space for better tech," Moore warned.

"Yeah sure, I'll do that." Malek said while stuffing the hot plate into his pack.

Convinced there was nothing else to learn, Dia pressed her finger against the panel and fed the lock. It retracted with a click.

"Woah!" Tait reach out even as Dia grabbed the handle. "You're not just gonna—"

Dia pulled open the door and stuck both her lamp and head out.

"Relax, Tait," Kalina said, "The doors aren't trapped, usually."

"How would you know? Have you ever seen one?"

"It wasn't trapped," Dia said, peering down the hall, "clearly."

"Three doors, three traps, two impassable," she said over her shoulder, "and the other doable only because of that gravity thingy Tait has in his bag."

Tait jerked in surprise. "How did you...?"

"Don't question it, man," Malek said cheerfully, then looked at Dia. "No bot?"

"Oh wait, yeah, it's looking right at me, but I figured we could just walk by it."

"Ha ha," Malek said in flat reply, "you're so funny."

"Then don't ask stupid questions."

"Anyways," Kalina interjected, stepping between them to address Dia, "what matters is if there's a trap between us and the first room."

"Of course there is, but it's one of the impassable ones."

"...damn."

"Wait," Tait frowned, "they trapped the break room? Who does that?"

Kalina snorted. "They trap everything."

"But not the doors?"

"They usually just lock the doors."

"So, it's crush?" Malek asked as he sidestepped around Kalina.

Kalina rounded on him. "Would you stop saying that!?"

Dia shrugged. "Depends on what's in Tait's magical bag of tricks."

They all turned to him.

He took an involuntary step back. "What's the trap?"

"Four crystal blades, staggered about a finger a part, each coming from a different direction."

Moore winced. "Ouch."

"Well," Malek guffawed, "not for long."

Tait stared at her, mouth ajar. "How could you—"

"Don't question it," Moore warned. He looked over at Dia. "Can't walk around it?"

"No, these aren't like the upper levels. Gotta bypass it somehow."

She gave Tait a very pointed look. Or rather, his pack.

Tait's eyes darted between all of them. Dia could see the reticence build up tension in his body.

"No no _no_," he said, shaking his head. "This is stupid. I don't even know why I came with you...you maniacs. I'm going back."

Moore casually stepped between Tait and the access panel. Tait went very still.

"You...you can't keep me here." His head jerked back. "That's not right."

"You can leave any time you want," Moore said in a level voice, "just not with that." His eyes landed on Tait's pack.

Tait swallowed hard. "No, I have to, _have to_ return this. You don't understand, she'll kill me."

"She?" Kali raised an eyebrow.

Tait's mouth snapped shut with an audible clack. His eyes grew hard as he let the silence stretch.

"Fine." Malek crossed his arms. "You want, you can stay in here where it's nice and safe. We'll return the pack when we're done. No damage, no foul."

"And what the fuck do I do when you die out there?"

Malek shrugged. "Won't be our problem. But you ain't gettin' a share if you play the coward."

Tait's eyes flashed at that. He worked his jaw, lips curled from something sour. His fist clenched into white knuckles.

"Fine," he spat out. "Fucking fine."

He swung his pack around and dug through it until he found a piece of tech. He thrust it at her.

"See now, that wasn't too hard." Malek slapped in on the shoulder. "And hey, look on the bright side. We're all walking out of here rich."

"Not likely," Tait mumbled.

_What does that mean?_ Dia cocked her head, certain that Tait was playing them on some level. Probably related to that 'she' was he mentioned.

She huffed out her exasperation. As much as she wanted to ring Tait dry of everything he knew, it simply wasn't the time.

Dia dipped her head out into the corridor again, just to be safe, then walked out once she was certain it was clear.

She eyed the rectangular block in her hand. It was solid, but not a solid piece. Thin pieces folded together to form a whole. Once activated, it would unfold into a large, hollow rectangular tunnel. Four of the sides would manifest several layers of blue-glass shields on each side.

_Ugh, that's gonna take a lot graescence for a small tunnel._

"I hate delving." Dia ran her hand down her face. "Why does everything require us to _crawl_ through it?"

"Okay," Kalina clapped, "so we can get to the first door?"

Dia nodded.

Kalina turned to Malek with a vicious smile. "See? Not crush."

"Yeah yeah." He rubbed his ear.

She snatched it out of his hand and stalked down the hall, stopping a pace before the first trap. Her light dimmed as she funnelled most of her energy into the rectangle.

It took a lot, way more than she anticipated, and she was gasping for breath by the time it stopped accepting her graescence.

Suddenly, the rectangle unfolded, pieces splitting then snapping into shape, forming an origami box propped up on stilts, sized almost the same dimensions as the access tunnel. What looked like blue-tinted glass formed over the four longer sides.

Then it formed another layer of glass, pushing both it and the first layer out. It did this six more times.

"That was..." She turned, breathing hard. "Someone... else is doing... agh." She sat down before she fell over.

_And thus ended the story of Dia. Brave delver who got dizzy and fell into the..._ She frowned. "Blades of death?"

"What?" Tait looked confused.

"It thought we decided that was a stupid name?" Malek said.

"The Grater," Moore said with finality.

"I'm noticing a theme here..."

"Come on guys," Kalina said, "we've got more important things to do than name every trap we come across... besides, it's clearly a Slicer."

Dia looked up at them and chuckled. "We are shit at naming."

Moore frowned. "I thought The Blender was good."

"Naw, yeah, that was pretty good."

Malek wagged his head. "We can't name everything after after kitchen utensils."

"Speak for yourself," Moore half grunted his reply.

"What is _wrong_ with you people?" Tait said, eyes jumping between them.

"Let's go," Dia shook her head, "but I'm not doing the next one."

The shield tunnel was next to her. She grabbed one corner and scooted it into place, using her foot as a pivot. The rest of the team had gathered behind her.

"We've got about five minutes," she said, not bothering to look back.

Nobody moved.

"So ah, you sure it's a _bladed_ trap?" Tait said after looking around for any sign of the trap.

"Yes, Tait, I'm sure."

"I vote Tait," Malek said cheerfully.

"I second that," Moore said.

"It is your tech, Tait," Kalina said.

"_No,_" Tait whispered, tone laced with fury, "and if you try to make me, I'll make sure none of you leave this place alive."

"Come on, man. We're just joking." Malek tried to slap him on the shoulder again, but Tait threw off his hand.

"Don't ever touch me again."

As though on cue, both of them shifted their stances, fists bawled, eyeing each other. Dia didn't think either were the type to throw a first punch, but it was hard to predict with tensions so high.

"I'll go," Dia said before they devolved into a fist fight.

She moved to her hands and knees. "I'll just do the whole damn thing myself," she mumbled, then began to crawl through the rectangle.

About half way through, the paused, twisting her head to watch.

Four blades of crystal folded into existence from nothing, then snapped toward Dia so quickly she almost didn't see it.

The first layer of blue-glass shielding flashed violet and then shattered with a crack of sound that filled the hallway. Pieces of fractured violet floated outward, looking surprisingly like real glass until they dissolved away.

Dia yelped at the noise. It didn't stop her from noticing how a pale green had infected the blade's pure crystal.

The second layer of shielding lasted a moment longer. The third layer even longer. With each layer of shattered glass, the blades attacking them shifted into deeper greens, then finally blues. At the fifth layer, it was the blades that shattered.

It all happened within the span of a second.

Dia let out a sigh of relief and scrambled her way out of the tunnel.

"See!? Now _that's_ crystal."

The rest of her party stared, mouths ajar, as the box reformed layers until it was back to its original configuration.

"Fuuuuck," Malek said with all the eloquence of a muse.

Kalina went next, though Dia barely noticed, staring intently at the interaction between blade and shield.

_Glass interferes with glass, degrading its own...fabric?_ It was a well known phenomena, or it was among those who knew such things. Quality glass was highly prized for this reason, able to shatter inferior glass. Yet the actual mechanics of glass interactions remained a mystery.

And Dia could almost see it, almost feel the answer in the air. Yet it remained just out of reach, an itch on the peripheral of her awareness.

Malek went next, scrambling through the tunnel about as fast he could.

Dia's head jerked to the side as she watched the blades. They'd made it to the sixth layer that time. Also, was the blue glass a darker tint? She thought so.

Meanwhile, Tait shifted on his feet, his breathing shallow and quick. He wavered on his feet as something like horror descended on face.

_No, not horror. More like the retroactive terror of someone realizing just how many times they'd come close to dying without realizing it._

He looked over at Moore with something like pleading in his eyes. Moore shook his head slowly, then jerked it toward the tunnel.

Dia was almost surprised he didn't run. Instead, he deflated and took a deep breath to steady himself. He crawled through the tunnel with all the solemnity of a man walking to his death.

_Seventh layer, and the blue is definitely darker. The box is running out of power._

"Wait!"

But Moore had followed on Tait's heels, and Dia watched in horror as the blades shattered layer after layer faster than ever, fingering ever closer to slicing her friend into pieces.

The blades shattered at the eighth and final layer.

She let out a sigh of relieve when Moore exited the tunnel in one piece.

She watched, waiting for the box to reform its shielding but it didn't. She carefully reached over and grabbed one of the stilts and pulled it toward her.

Only a few seconds later, the origami box folded into itself.

_That...that was too close._

"Can we maybe not linger in the hallway?" Malek suggested. He'd walked over to lean against the wall in a forced casualness that belied none of the tension in his body.

"Right." Dia approached the door. "Door's not trapped, but it is locked."

Beside it was a panel sectioned into a four by four grid, creating smooth section of unmarked elderin feeders, ready to receive graescence. Feed the sections in the right order, and the door would unlock. Simple, except for the sheer number of combinations possible made it virtually impossible to guess. It took the lock a few seconds to bleed out graescence from past attempts, forcing a would be attacker to wait between tries. A delver could spend _decades_ down here and never guess the right password.

Dia, however, _knew_ a few things.

_Let's see, passcode is six long, and I'll number the sections by column then row. Code involves sections 1-1, 1-4, 2-3, and 3-2. 1-1 and 3-2 have to be fed together. Sections fed together can't be used separately in the code. Well, that narrows it down a lot._

She smiled. "Give me five minutes."

_I am a lock's arch nemesis. Mwa ha ha..._

She began entering combinations.

"Why is she smiling like that?" Tait said after watching her for a few seconds.

"Shush, I'm concentrating..."

_Wait... did I try 1-4, 2-3 first or was it—_

"You get used to it," Malek said as he leaned against a wall, smirking. "Please oh master lock thief—"

Dia spun, "Will you shut up!?"

"Hmm... no. I'm bored." He didn't look bored.

"You're just making it take longer." She turned back to the lock, shaking her head.

_Now what was the last— agh, never mind. I'll just start over._

"You know you can't respond to him," Kalina said. "He's like a child, a small one, that thrives on all the wrong kinds of attention and learns all the wrong lessons."

Bickering and cutting remarks were how they dealt with stress, a weird form of gallows humor. Dia learned that long ago, and despite the distraction, there was a comfort in the familiar back and forth.

Malek looked over at Kali askance. "Like what?"

Kalina's grin showed teeth. She stepped up next to him, crossed her arms, and leaned back against the wall in obvious mockery of his posture. Her face slackened into an exaggerated bored expression.

"Hey," she jerked her head while speaking in a low voice, "I'm so great I can lean against walls and throw out stupid jokes..." she paused and turned to Malek with a concerned expression, "aren't funny."

Malek pushed off the wall. "I don't sound like that."

"Yeah, you kind of do." Dia spoke over her should without pausing.

"Come on, you're just being mean. Moore, help a friend out?"

Moore looked between the bickering trio. "You do kinda do that," he shrugged, then sat down.

Malek threw up his hands. "I do not! You know what? Fine," he huffed, "if I do that then Kalina here is all..." he stuck out his chest and started strutting.

Kalina's eyes went wide. "Oh you did not—"

"Got it!"

They all turned to Dia, who'd placed her hand on the door. "You guys comin or not?"

She pushed through without waiting for a reply and scanned their new room.
