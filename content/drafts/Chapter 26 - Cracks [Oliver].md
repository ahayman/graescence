# 26 | Cracks [Oliver]

Oliver stumbled toward the water in a thin haze of apathy. It was getting thinner, a dangerous precedent he feared would continue.

He less knelt so much as he fell to his knees hard enough to bruise. Pain assaulted apathy and apathy won, but only barely.

The water was the only thing he cared about, and it was failing him. He shoveled mouths full at his face. When that wasn't enough, he dumped his head beneath the placid surface and practically inhaled the liquid until his stomach managed to pierce his apathy with enough pain to make him stop.

He stumbled back from the water and flopped onto his back to wait.

...and wait, and wait, and wait.

A sense of fulfillment danced beyond his reach, taunting him. He tried reaching for it, tried to entice it back, trick it into embracing him. It didn't work. It never worked anymore. The bliss never came. It had abandoned him.

But the colors had not. They never did anymore. Leave him, that is. They remained forever in his 'vision', though that wasn't the right word. They swirled around and through the world endlessly, dancing about.

Yet he could find no joy in them. They weren't the bliss he'd thought. They'd lied to him, and that was the ultimate betrayal. He would have cut out his eyes to spite them if it would work. It wouldn't. The colors weren't tied to his eyes. They were something else, a new type of sense he couldn't cut out of himself.

After minutes, hours, perhaps even days on his back—he didn't know, time had become wobbly long ago—Oliver sat up as an itch crawled around beneath his skin. There was only one itch crawling around. Only one, a little bug digging about behind his left shoulder, just out of reach.

He resisted the urge to try and scratch it anyway. It never did anything except make it worse. He had mostly healed scabs running along both forearms from scratching. Probably a few on his back. Legs. Chest.

All from his single attempt to stop drinking the water.

He stood and began to pace. The motion felt so familiar, he must have done it a lot, though he couldn't recall.

Movement helped the itch. Or perhaps it simply distracted him from it. It wouldn't work long, though. Already the little itch bug had split into to, and now he had a new itch digging down the center of his back.

Itches weren't his only problem. He was empty. An emotional hole had opened up within him that he could no longer ignore. He poked at it, curious, trying to tease apart the nature of it.

This wasn't bliss; nor was it apathy. It felt new and old at the same time, like a half-forgotten memory. His mind tried to dredge up recollections to associate with the feeling, tried to tell him it wasn't unusual. He felt this before. Perhaps in another life.

It _felt new_.

He sped up his pacing, reversing his motion at each jutting wall. He paced, trying to understand this new sensation, put a word to it, a label he could use to contain it. When he finally had that word, the entire world snapped into startling clarity. He knew it now, he knew what he was.

His marble fell to the sand, uncaught.

For an eternity, he'd been endlessly throwing it in the air, catching it, and rolling it along both sides of his fingers. At first, he did it because it seemed to dance with the colors, but eventually, it simply became a part of him.

Even with it so close, just a few fingers from his foot, it _felt_ too far away, like a piece of himself had fallen off.

He snatched it from the sand and palmed it while he tried to parse this new feeling.

He was lonely.

"Mike?" The word croaked out of a throat unused.

He missed Mike, their even-headed unofficial leader. Hell, some might call him a boss, though the term grossly misrepresented his role in their little group. Or the power their group held—boss implied the power of a gang, which was hardly a description anyone would apply to their little group.

Jared, Tabbie, Brandon and, yes, even Andrea, he missed them all.

Painfully. He missed them, like a rock in his stomach, pulling him down.

The itch duplicated again, and now a bug was burrowing into his side.

"What am I doing?"

Oliver approached the beach and leaned over, allowing the still water to mirror his reflection in the green light.

He flinched at the sight.

Mirrored in the waters was a ghoul. Scarred, pallid skin stretched thin over bones and little else. Hollow cheekbones framed sunken, dull eyes that didn't so much stare back at him as much as they stared through him, listlessly seeing nothing.

He carefully poked his finger into the sunken skin between his ribs.

It was his stomach that really took him aback. It looked...wrong, like it was filled, but not in the right way. And he knew he hadn't eaten since...since...

He didn't know. His stomach tried to growl, but it was a pitiful thing, less growl and more a whimper.

He _had_ eaten; he'd _been_ eating. He could remember stuffing his face with moss, over and over, eating until his stomach hurt.

His feet were wet, though they hadn't touched the water. No, he'd peed himself. Shock coursed through him, not that he'd done such a thing, but that it felt perfectly normal.

He'd been peeing himself for a long time.

He stumbled back from the water, confused and disoriented by the reflection of a reality that mirrored nothing of himself.

He'd eaten; he should _look_ like he'd eaten.

Oliver stumbled back from the water, recoiling at the dissonance. His mind tried to reject it. It whispered alternatives. Perhaps he hadn't seen what he'd seen? Perhaps he was hallucinating?

Yes, that must be it. He'd heard of drinks going bad, of people overtaken by paranoia and fear. This must be that. That...thing in the water wasn't him. That thing peed itself. It might even have shat itself. Burning sands, but it may have even shat out parts of itself.

It _couldn't_ be him, because if so, he was a short step away from watering the sands with what little was left of him, which wasn't much. Not much at all.

He cast his gaze about the cavern, looking for...what? He didn't know. An illusion, perhaps? Something unexplainable. Something that might suggest he truly was hallucinating, something to give credence to the lie the water had tried to force upon his mind.

What he saw was bare stone stripped of moss to the point that most of his light came from other parts of the cavern. What little light came from his immediate surrounding came from moss he couldn't reach. The glow from it was thin, dying, cut off as it was from the pool of life.

See, he _had_ been eating it. He couldn't be that ghoul he'd seen. It was impossible.

The thought almost took hold before another forced its way in and demanded his attention.

This was not his cave.

He stared at the walls, the floor, the _curve_ of the beach. They were all wrong; they weren't his; they weren't what he remembered.

He spun around and tried to run away from the beach toward where he knew his entrance was, that hole made of chipped stone he'd crawled out of a lifetime ago.

The sudden motion caused his head to spin and...

...he was on the ground. He squeezed his eyes shut twice, willing the world to stop wobbling. Eventually, it did.

Oliver slowly sat up. He was pretty sure turning around shouldn't cause a person to black out, but it had only been a second. Surely, it wasn't that big of a deal.

He stood back up—slowly, of course—then examined the back of his little alcove. No matter how he searched, he could find no sign of his entrance.

This was not his cave.

But how? It made no sense. He hadn't somehow learned to swim, had he?

No. He spent several minutes scouring his memory and nothing came back. Furthermore, he hadn't even waded in the water, much less attempted its depths.

And for good reason. Several times he saw something in the water, bulging the placid surface. It never broke, though, and he couldn't be certain he hadn't hallucinated it. But no, no amount of bliss-fueled apathy could overcome _his_ fear of being eaten alive while drowning in the depths.

No, he hadn't attempted to swim. He'd barely been brave enough to get his ankles wet.

There must be another reason.

Oliver spent the next hour examining the walls in the hopes of finding some opening that might explain how he'd gotten here. He even examined the ceiling, thinking maybe he'd fallen down another shaft, though even he could admit the idea was ridiculous.

He found nothing. No holes, no paths, no way in. The only notable exception was a series of stress fractures along the right wall abutting his personal ocean. Likely, the cracks had formed during one of Ionia's bouts of restlessness.

Cracks...

The word dragged a memory along with it, hallucinations of him slipping through the cracks of reality. He hadn't been walking through space, he'd been walking through cracks formed between space.

But _that_ had only been a dream, a waking hallucination. Hadn't it?

He stared at the cracks and found them familiar. He knew them. The idea was absurd, but he couldn't shake the feeling.

He'd walked through these cracks.

He tried to take a step back, but some rock jumped up and grabbed his heel, causing him to fall on his butt.

_Cracks..._

No. He shook off the absurd idea. He needed...he needed something. Something real. Something that would make sense of all this.

While his mind spun, he walked to the water, habit guiding his steps. He knelt to take a drink, but the image staring back at him subsumed his attention.

It was the ghoul.

Slowly, he dipped his hands into the water and brought it back to his lips. All the while, the ghoul matched his motions perfectly. There was no hesitation, nothing to suggest the image before him was anything less than a mirrored reflection of his self.

He had become a ghoul.

The idea no longer held the horror it had a couple of hours ago. His subconscious had processed the idea that he hadn't eaten like he thought he had.

Or, perhaps moss wasn't as nutritious as he originally believed.

That wasn't important, though. Maybe he hadn't eaten enough. Maybe the thing mirrored back at him wasn't a lie.

That idea paled to the revelation that he could walk through the cracks of reality. He had no idea what that meant, but it felt true on some instinctual level he couldn't define.

Oliver Sands could walk through the cracks of reality.

He just had to figure out how, if only he could stop itching.

The itch bugs had duplicated until he lost track of their number. Until now, he'd avoided scratching at them, but the sensation drew his finger of their own accord, and he began to dig into his skin with long, half-cracked fingernails.

He forcibly stopped himself, remembering the image of the scarred ghoul, pulling it foremost in his mind as motivation to _not tear off his own skin_.

Because that's what he wanted to do. He needed a knife, or, or, or something... something sharp. A sharp rock. Yes, that's it. Then he'd carefully, slowly, and with great relish, flay himself alive.

It sounded wonderful. All the little bugs would crawl out and stop crawling between his muscles.

"NO!"

He was scratching again.

"_No,_" the cave echoed back.

He stared back at the water. The ghoul reflected there was bleeding from rents along the sides of his chest.

He needed a distraction; he needed to walk through cracks in space.

It occurred to him then, that he might be insane. But, well, somehow, it just didn't feel all that important.

Back at the cave wall, he tried to push his finger through a crack formed vertically from the floor to just over his head. It didn't work, of course. The crack was far too narrow to allow even the smallest part of himself ingress.

Undeterred by...physics, he tried a variety of other parts of his body. His shoulder, head, nose, tongue, toe—that one ended with him on his ass—nothing worked.

Oliver flopped on his back, staring at a crack in the stone he'd walked through at some point without a clue of how he'd done it. His marble danced through his fingers as he pondered the issue.

Certainty clashed with reason. People didn't walk through cracks less than a finger wide. It was common sense; it was a thing that hardly needed to be said.

Yet he had done such a thing.

Reason countered that he'd hallucinated the experience, and he could hardly argue against that. The waters were certainly good at twisting reality. Perhaps he'd gone insane?

Yet Oliver Sands could walk through the cracks of reality.

The statement was absurd. Not just what it posited, but the words themselves. What _were_ cracks in reality? The words defined a shape that had no meaning. Reality didn't have cracks. He couldn't imagine what "cracks in reality" might be, couldn't wrap his head around the words.

But he could remember the experience, the way reality stretched itself around him, bending to his will. He recalled how the world would lens into impossible shapes until the very substance of things lost meaning amongst particulates of matter bound to itself.

He pushed himself up to standing and flicked the marble into the air with his thumb. It caught the light and for a moment that light wrapped itself around the marble, drawing his eye with an iridescent sheen. He followed its descent until it landed on his palm with the weight of worlds.

Oliver blinked slowly, studying the deep purple sphere. Just...maybe?

The thought dragged his brow down between his eyes. His fingers wrapped the marble as he approached the cracked wall until his nose pressed against the cold stone.

He closed his eyes and fed his marble essence.

A river of graescence poured from him into the round ball, and the world began to twist. Oliver opened his eyes when the pressure against his nose disappeared. No longer did a wall stand before him, but a canyon.

Imposing walls of dark stone rose at an angle to impossible heights that disappeared above into a blurry mess of gray. A raised platform just wide enough for him to walk on stretched into the distance, also disappearing into a horizon made of black.

The crack had been altered, tailored made for him and him alone.

Yes! This is it!

He laughed out loud, and the sound seemed to twist back into his ears, almost like he was wearing a bag over his head.

Disconcerted, he snapped his mouth shut.

The itching lessened enough for him to stop digging into his skin.

There was skin under his fingernails. He raised his hand to look at them, but the feeling of movement distracted him. The motion felt weird, like he was moving both too fast and too slow at the same time.

He took a step forward and almost fell over as the world shifted around him. He had only taken a step and yet in that step, he'd felt the world move too much and not enough.

The second step fared better and by the third, he'd adjusted to the sensation. It felt familiar, like he'd done it dozens, if not hundreds of times before.

He was pretty sure he'd be puking his guts out if it weren't for the weeks, months, or whatever he'd spent drinking hallucinogenic water.

Darkness quickly overtook the canyon as he walked. It didn't matter. He knew its topography like a road he'd traveled a hundred times before. His feet could feel the steps they needed to take, almost as though he were forming them himself.

That wasn't correct, though. He didn't just form the steps from nothing. He formed them between the vast weights of the world around him. His mind concluded he was, in fact, walking through one of the cracks in the stone. If the crack didn't extend to the other side, then neither could he. But so long as the crack extended, he simply needed to form the steps that would take him through it. The fact that he stepped on a flat surface, where none should be, didn't bother him so much in light of every other impossibility before him.

It was a heady experience, and for once he was glad he had no water to addle his senses. Here he walked between worlds, safely ensconced between the incredible loads upon which matter imposed upon reality.

He wouldn't want that haze of apathy to detract from the experience.

And that's what it felt like. The world imposed itself upon reality, almost like an invasion against the void. Oliver simply wafted through the cracks, inconsequential against the great nothing that stretched into infinity.

It was mere moments before the canyon's exited shone from a distance that threatened to blind him. It was a moment later that he stepped into that brilliance.

He frowned as the world re-asserted itself, leaving him on a very familiar shore, the one he'd always thought was his. And yet, it felt so distant, and that didn't seem right. Hadn't he just spilled through his...self-made hole?

That thought had mere moments to ferment before thousands of insects burst beneath his skin and immediately began to burrow into his body.

Oliver screamed as he collapsed, his marble spilling from his hand onto the sand. This wasn't just the itch, it was something worse, far worse. It was vengeance for his audacity to stave off the itch with his marble.

He reached for the marble, but sudden spasms redirected his attempts into the sand. He might've continued his attempt, but the rest of his body had succumbed and drawn his body into a rather accurate rendition of a dying scorpion.

_That_ thought lasted less than the first until the muscle pain overcame thought itself.

The screaming that echoed back to him sounded nothing like his voice.
