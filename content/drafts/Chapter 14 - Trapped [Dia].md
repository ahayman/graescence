# 14 | Trapped [Dia]

_It's here._

She wanted to get up, to run, to leap with joy, to dance. She alternated between crying and moaning instead, her efforts to move doing little more than cause her to roll around on the floor.

She did eventually get up. She was exhausted but her prize was here.

_It's really here!_

Dust, snot, tears, and blood had mixed to make a rather disgusting paste, and her attempts to wipe her face only made it worse. She gave up after a few attempts and took the light back out from her pack.

She frowned at hard it was to light it up, feeling lightheaded from the effort, scraping the dredges of her graescence.

The Inscribers were at the very back of the room, sitting on a row of small tables made of structural elderin. Yes, Inscribers, plural. Four of them lined the back wall.

_Four._

She walked in daze, her eyes glued to her life's dream and completely ignoring the dozens of graetech devices in various stages of completion littering the other tables.

There was enough tech in the room to buy a entire mountain but Dia had eyes for only one device.

The two right-most Inscribers were huge, each taking up a quarter of the wall and far too large for her to carry— even three people would struggle. These were for rough and quick prototypes for testing, having only four arms to inscribe with.

The middle one was smaller, better? It created more refined models but Dia didn't really get why it was needed. It also had four arms.

The left-most Inscriber was what held her full attention. It was quite a bit smaller than the other but was a precision instruments the likes of which she'd never seen. It could have quite possibly even made the slate thingy in her pack.

_Well, maybe, but it would take years to create something like that._

Ten spidery arms arced over a spherical work area. Four manipulated Elderin core while the other six inscribed it. Before it, a glossy orb of Elderin reflected breathtaking complexity within its crimson tinted wood grain. Each microscopic channel was perfect, fractally nested within individual layers of grain, snaking completely throughout the orb with a kind of logic that defied understanding.

Dia could sense the complexity within it but she could not understand it. Here before her was the culmination of a life's work, genius she could only hint at.

She tentatively reached out and caressed one of the spidery arms.

_It's too big for my pack but maybe if I fold the arms?_

Reverently, she put her fingers on the orb and fed it a small stream of energy.

The Inscriber stabbed her in the wrist.

"Ow."

She stared at her wrist for a second before ever-so-carefully extracting it from the Inscriber tip.

The wound welled up a spot of blood, but not much. It wasn't deep, maybe half a finger, and it didn't even hurt.

_Those arms have an amazing range of motion._

She tried again, but this time fed it a whole lot less energy and watched the arm twitch around.

_...and sensitive. Sheesh, this is going to take some practice._

It took her ten minutes before she got the hang of it... and by that she could sort of barely control the arms. _Where_ and, oddly, _how_ she fed the graescence mattered a lot. The thing took far more finesse than she anticipated.

Another five minutes and she had folded the arms into the workspace. It was still too big to fit inside her pack, but at least she could carry it without killing herself. And anyway, delvers had solutions to this sort of problem.

She rummaged through her mostly still empty pack and pulled out several straps. After a few seconds of though, she walked to one of the tables and dumped as many of the graetech as she could into her pack. She then carefully strapped the Inscriber to the pack, stuffing as much as the pack into its workspace as possible, leaving the shoulder straps on the outside.

She shouldered the pack, staggered under the weight, and took a few tentative steps. It... was fine. She could do it. Yes, it was heavy, maybe even very heavy, but what was the alternative, _not_ take the very reason she'd risked her life for?

She tried very hard not to think about the climb back up ahead of her cause it didn't matter. She'd would either make it or she'd die. Those were her options, cause she would never, ever let her Inscriber go.

_Never._

She walked out of the room, legs shaky, and almost closed the door behind her before realizing that doing so would rearm the trap.

_Oh... huh, oops. Maybe I should have told them the trap was disabled._

Malek had fallen asleep on his pack, literally— he was snoring. Moore was also on his back staring up at the ceiling. Tait was doing something with his pack— the kid was neurotic.

Kalina was pacing. She hadn't stopped since the moment Dia had begun working on the door. She was the first to notice Dia appear.

"Dia!" she gasped and lunged at her as soon as Dia was close.

She did not knock Dia over but it was a close thing with all that weight on her back. She wrapped her arm around Dia, crying and squeezing, though the pack was making it difficult.

Then suddenly she pushed Dia, causing her to stumble back.

"Never do that again. Do you hear? _Never_. I thought you were dead!"

"Come on, Kalina, I'm fine. I knew what I was doing."

"Liar. None of us do and... and we stick together. You hear me?" She took Dia by the shoulder and shook her. "_We. stick. to. gether. Do you hear me!?_"

"Yes! Gods Kalina, I'm fine." Dia replied as she tried extricating her from the other girl's arms.

Kalina let her, tears staining her cheeks as she shook her head in exasperation.

"You're always so careful. Why? Why do this?"

Dia's lips twitched as she gave a small shrug, then slowly turned to show the Inscriber strapped to her back.

Kalina froze.

"That's... that's it? An Inscriber?" she said quietly.

Dia nodded.

For just a moment Kalina's face flickered through fear and then sadness before she managed a strained smile.

"That's... great..." she said through her smile, but then seemed to catch herself. "No, no that's _wonderful_ Dia! That's incredible! That's—"

Her words cut off and her face went slack. Her eyes grew large and the color drained from her.

"Kalina?"

"_Don't_ move," Kalina whispered through her teeth.

Dia frowned and her eyes focused beyond Kalina to the rest of the group. They'd all gotten up to watch the entertainment, and now every single one of them was standing as still as they could, fear painting pale faces.

Only then did Dia realize she now _knew_ a lot of new stuff.

_Three sets of rails staggered near the bottom, curved to provide base levitation, thrust, and directional control. Three apertures take in visible light, heat light, and even graescence. An image processing core tied to a threat heuristic module triggered by motion. One arm ends in a graetech sword for close combat. The other fires spacial Warps at distance using a two-pronged Lance that also generates a very weird field. Four shield generators provide protection._

Aside from the info dump, she had two conflicting thoughts.

_I really want to take that thing apart._

Also, _We are so fucked._

"Don't move!" Dia yelled.

"I'm not!" Kalina whispered indignantly.

"Not you. Tait was going for his bag."

"I've got something for bots," Tait said while staring at the pack by his feet with wild eyes, "but why isn't it attacking?"

"It's triggered by motion."

"...how much motion?"

"I don't know! I just know as soon as we move, it starts killing us."

_...in rather spectacular fashion. I've never even heard of a two-pronged Lance before. What must the Warps be like?_

"I hate to agree with Tait," Malek said, "but it's not like we can stand here forever— or wait, will it get bored and leave? Do bots get bored? Cause that would be great if just left."

"Bots don't get bored stupid," Kalina said and twitched her head as though to shake it, then froze. She let out a slow breath. "Gods that thing is creepy."

Dia had to resist the suicidal urge to turn around and look.

"How would you know?" Malek said.

"Could you guys argue later?" Tait's eyes were looking panicked.

"Okay Tait," Dia said, "how quickly can you get your bot device thingy?"

"It's not a thingy, and pretty damn quick," he replied. A light sheen of sweat was beading on his forehead as he glanced down. "...I think? It's in the front pocket— why isn't it moving? It's just staring at us."

"Focus! What does it do?"

"Oh...? So now you don't know!?"

"And _now_ look who's arguing," Malek mumbled.

Dia spoke slowly through clenched teeth. "No, I don't, not unless you take it out of the pack."

"How does that even work?"

Dia suppressed a rather strong urge to walk over an slap him.

"We might die if we continue like this," Moore said.

"Right right right. Tait, What's. it. do?"

"I don't know, okay. She didn't say. She just told me to use it on the bot."

Dia closed her eyes, wishing now more than ever that she'd just made the fool show her what was in his bag.

_Right, okay. So we've got some device thingy that does something to the bot and maybe lets us get away. If any of us moves, it'll shoot us. We've got two traps to go back through—_

"Can we distract it and hide?" Malek suggested.

_Distract it? Hmm... yeah, maybe._

Kalina screwed up her face. "Hide _where_?"

"One of the rooms?"

"It would just follow us in," Dia replied, "it has access to all rooms." _...and it disables traps as it passes through them, which is interesting._

"So we're crushed?"

"No, Malek's right. We need to distract it," Dia said, annoyed, "Okay okay, here's what we're going to do. Tait, I'm gonna throw this light over my shoulder. That should trigger the bot and give you enough time to get your bot killer thingy out of your bag."

"Uh... I..." Tait began to breathe hard, "I don't want to die."

"Oh really!? No shit? You don't want to die? How fucking weird, Tait. Maybe you should just talk to the bot instead—"

"Kalina, please," Dia interrupted, "we can't loose our shit, okay."

Kalina had been practically yelling in Dia's face, unable to turn and vent her wrath on Tait. The girl was verging on panic.

_Yeah, and Tait also isn't looking too well._

"I know, I know, I'm sorry... it's just," she lowered her voice to a whisper, "he's really getting on my nerves."

"Yeah me too, but I need you Kalina. Please?"

"I'm fine," she took a deep breath, "See? Fine. I'll... just shut up now."

"No Kalina that's not what I— okay, not the time. Tait," she shifted her eyes to Tait, "I know you're scared— we all are —but you've got the only thing that can save us, okay?"

"Yeah..." His hands were shaking.

_We need to do this now, before he looses it._

"Okay, on the count of three... one."

"Wait! No, I can't do this, I'm not ready."

"You have to Tait. It's the only way. _Two_"

"Oh gods... oh gods..."

"Don't loose it, Tait. Ready? _Three!_"

"No no! I'm not— shit!"

Dia threw the light, using her body to shield the motion as much as possible from the bot behind her.

Tait, still cursing, lunged for his pack and ripped open the front patch.

_Two massive resevoirs, loss rate of about 1% per hour, now 90% full. Solid barrel directly connected to two reactive cores. Barrel tapering down, then flaring slightly, causing a kind of compression that forces the graescence into a very compressed field, not quite a Warp but close, then expanding out as a disruptive force. Effective range around twelve paces._

The bot moved, swinging its arm to track the light.

As Tait brought the weapon up and Dia realized she and Kalina were in the way. She shoved her friend, sending them both toward opposite walls. Kalina stumbled and fell, which was probably for the best. Dia hit hit the wall and began shouldering off her pack as Tait fired the bot-killer, screaming at the top of his lungs.

_No, not a killer. Disruptor._

The bot-disruptor immediately released its payload. Space around the flared tip of the weapon compressed inward, drawing toward the weapon and bending light around itself. A deep thrump filled the hallways, drowning out Tait's scream.

Dia pressed herself against the wall as the wave of compressed graescence passed her. She felt her breath stolen from her as it passed by...

...and crashed into the bot's shields.

_No!_

The bot's arm snapped over, abandoning the thrown lamp and targeting Tait instead. As it moved, the light began to twist around the tips of it's spear-like arm. At the base of the prongs, a black emptiness formed, sucking in more and more of the light as the space around the bot lensed around it, making it appear larger. A moment later, it pulsed out, gaining momentum and a strength as is raced through the prongs. The Warp sped toward Tait, distorting space around it as it travelled.

Dia screamed as the Warp passed her and _pulled_ at her, tearing her off the wall and almost dragging her along with it as she stumbled.

It hit Tait just off center mass and tore a fist-sized hole straight through his chest.

His mouth gaped as confusion clouded his face. He tried to speak but nothing would come out. He stumbled back a step and reached toward the hole in his chest as though he couldn't believe it. Their eyes met, both reflecting confusion and horror. His mouth worked repeatedly, saying "no" over and over as he shook his head.

And all Dia could think was, _there's one charge left..._

She lunged for Tait and tore the device from his hands. He actually tried to fight her for a moment, but his strength was draining.

"Here here you stupid thing!" Moore's voice echoed from her left.

Dia spun and raised the weapon. She saw Moore waving his hands on her periphery, drawing the bot's attention. Already the light was twisting around the prongs of its arm as it pointed towards Moore.

Dia fed the bot-disruptor through a white-knuckled grip. It required very little, her feed working as a trigger to release the second reservoir. Immediately, space began warping around the flat end of her weapon, barely three fingers in diameter. It took less than a second to form, but in that moment Dia knew it would be too late to save Moore.

The bot's weapon fired a split second before hers. It sped toward Moore as her wave expanded out. They crossed a few feet in front of him and the interaction between them redirected the Warp, sending it into the wall next to him.

The wave continued on, unabated, and washed over the bot. No shield stopped it.

The bot collapsed. Dia watched it nervously for a second as it twitched.

_Internal oscillating feedback between it's resevoirs. An overload. Five minutes, maybe, before that oscillation stabilizes out and we've got an active murderbot on our hands._

"Oh! Murderbot."

"Now..." Moore said, his voice a little shaky. He took a breath. "Now that's a good name."

Dia turned to him and gasped. His face was crisscrossed with blood and it took her a moment to realize it was from the shards of stone the murderbot's warp had thrown when it impacted the wall.

"No, I'm fine but..." he said, looking distant at some other thing.

Dia followed his gaze to see Tait choking in his own blood. The boy had collapsed after his brief struggle with Dia and was laying on his back, face up, blood spilling from his mouth. Tait's heart had been torn out, yet he was using his tongue to try to push out the blood from his mouth.

She walked over to him in a daze.

"I am so sorry," she said to him in an vacant tone, throwing empty words at dying boy who'd never wanted to come if the first place.

He glared at her hate until his eyes turned glassy and his tongue stopped moving. Dia stared at him for what felt like an eternity, unable to comprehend the significance of what'd happened.

The sound of someone throwing up invaded her senses.

_Four minutes, thirty seconds..._

"Oh gods, he's dead. Oh... oh, gods. I... Dia! Dia. Dia! He's dead. Dia... Dia!"

Dia shifted her gaze to her best friend, the prickly girl with a sharp tongue, and saw her pressing her back against the wall in a full-blown panic attack.

To the side, Malek was bent over, hands on knees as he finished emptying his stomach. He spit a couple times, then stumbled back against the wall.

"Kalina," Dia said, walking toward the girl, "you need to get a hold of yourself."

That was the wrong thing to say. Kalina began hyperventilating and repeating the words, 'oh gods he's dead', over and over again.

Dia walked over to her and leaned over.

"Kalina? Kalina!" But the girl was blubbering nonsense at this point.

"_Kali!_"

"Don't _call_ me that!" Kalina snarled at her.

"Oh good, so _that's_ what snaps you out. Gods listen girl, we've gotta get moving before our local murderbot wakes up and slaughters us all."

Kalina looked at Dia, her eyes dazed, before focusing on the murderbot.

"Oh..."

"Yeah. 'Oh.'"

Dia turned to Moore and Malek. Moore has already snapped himself out of the horror of what'd happened, but Malek appeared in a daze.

"You," she pointed at both of them, "need to drag that thing through the traps."

They both blinked at her, looking blank.

"What?"

"It's got something in it that disables traps as it passes. I think it'll still work."

Malek looked at her with an incredulous expression. "You _think_?"

"We don't have the time to bypass them before it wakes up. So either we drag it or..."

She left the rest unsaid. Malek and looked at Moore, but Moore was already walking toward the murderbot. He grabbed one of the still-twitching arms, pulled, and grunted.

"Heavy."

"No shit. That's all Elderin," Malek said as he walked up to the bot with a doubtful expression, "it's gotta weigh at least ton."

"Well, you gonna help?" Moore said while trying to drag the thing.

Malek turned to Dia. "You can't... you know, take it apart or something? It's got be worth half the mountain at least."

Dia stared at him for a moment. "No."

_Actually yes, but not before it murders us all..._ she fixed her eyes on it, _...so tempting though._

"Come on, brother, this thing is heavy," Moore grunted while tugging at the thing.

"Yeah, I guess..."

"Less than four minutes," Dia said as she bent over Tait and closed his eyes— it was the least she could do before she quite literally pillaged his pack.

Then she pillaged his pack.

"Four minutes until _what_?" Malek grunted while tugging on the bot.

"Until it wakes up."

Malek froze, stared down at the bot, and then his eyes went wide.

"Oh fuck!"

Both Moore and Malek began to pull at the bot with renewed enthusiasm, though it was still slow going. In the meantime, Dia shouldered Tait's pack on her front while reestablishing her own on her back.

She began to shake under the weight of it all.

_No, it's fine. I'm fine. I can do it..._

Kalina was still in a semi-catatonic state, staring at Tait as though he would suddenly get up and claim it was all just a stupid joke. But he didn't and...

"Kalina, I need you."

Kalina said nothing as she just stared at Tait.

"Kalina. Kalina?... damnit."

Then Dia did something she'd never imagined she'd ever have to do. She slapped Kalina... kind of hard.

"What the fuck Dia!"

"Well? You gonna just stare or you gonna help us get out of here alive?"

Kalina finally tore her gaze from the dead boy and turned to Dia. She blinked twice before seeming to come to herself.

"What?"

"That _thing_ is gonna wake up in less that four minutes," Dia said, gesturing at the bot the boys were trying to pull. "You wanna be around when it does?"

Kalina's gave shifted to the twitching murderbot. She shivered. "Umm... no?"

"Oh well good, then maybe you want to help us or are you going to stare at the dead boy all day?"

"I'll... help," Kalina said with a tinge of defensiveness in her tone, though she still walked in a daze. She approached the murderbot and, seemingly at random, grabbed a rail and began to pull listlessly.

Dia walked to the opposite side, grabbed a rail, and began pulling at it. It took the another half a minute to get the heavy construct to the first trap. In that that time Dia got her first good look at the thing.

_It's... like a skeleton._

A central pillar of rigid vertebrae flared out into arcing ribs that met in a sword-like sternum, curved slightly to create a Shaped Edge a pace beyond. It would make close combat virtually impossible.

Suspended within the ribcage was a series of misshapen spheres, haphazardly placed and suspended by a mess of hairline Elderin filaments, thousands of them creating a dangerous web that would shred anyone stupid enough to reach in. Six rails flowered from the bottom of the vertebrae column and arced upward, terminating into sharpened points.

Three flexible eye stalks curved forward from the top of the vertebrae column then flared into small orbs carved with concentric circles sunk into pits of darkness that ate the light.

The arms weren't physically attached, instead maintained using graescence by some means even Dia didn't understand. It gave them an unlimited range of motion and even allowed the bot to telescope the arm a few paces.

_How is that even possible? I_ need _to know how that's possible._

No one had caught a bot. No one had studied one. They had never been defeated, never been found 'dead' or inert. All attempts to study a bot ended in death when it inevitably recovered. At best they were disabled for a few minutes and avoided.

_I really, really want to take it apart..._

But that wasn't an option... yet.

Yet. It was word she couldn't shake, cause some part of her insisted she come back down, defeat the thing, and tear it apart to learn every single one of its secrets. It was stupid, insane even, the essence of arrogance to think she could succeed where countless others had failed. And yet...

Both Malek and Moore slowed as they approached the first trap.

"Keep going!" Dia yelled. _Three minutes..._

"Are you sure?"

"Yes! Go!" _Gods I hope so._

She couldn't "sense" it though. She _knew_ there were cutoffs to the traps, but tying that to whatever beacon or whatnot was in the murderbot was beyond her capabilities, apparently. Not that it mattered cause once the bot woke up they were all dead anyway.

Malek gave Moore a questioning look. The beefy boy shrugged and began pulling again.

A few seconds later it became clear the trap would not trigger. Dia breathed out a sigh of relief she hoped the others wouldn't hear. She wasn't sure she could take seeing Malek and Moore crushed into puddles of gore without her loosing her sanity.

No matter what facade she put forth, she felt moments from blubbering in a kind of full blown panic that would make Kalina look positively sane.

It took another two minutes to reach the next trap, the last one before freedom. At this point all four of them were shaking and sweating from an increasingly panicked effort. Everyone was huffing to the point that Dia began to wonder if they would make it at all.

They did. They made it, with perhaps thirty seconds to spare.

Perhaps.

And here's the thing: Dia's "knowledge" of graetech was no certain thing. She _thought_ they had thirty seconds left when they finally crossed through the final trap. The bot, however, was displaying more synchronicity in its twitches than Dia was comfortable with. The eye stalks had stopped twitching altogether, instead staring unerringly toward the four of them.

Her senses told her it was thirty seconds, but then only a few seconds later, they told her she had twenty seconds.

That's when she realized they were in trouble.

"Run!" she screamed.

All of the them rushed for the door, almost jamming themselves in the process. Dia was the last to make it, weighed down by the dual packs and stumbling from the weight.

She turned to shut the door behind her, hoping it might stall the bot for a couple seconds. It had already risen, arm up and pointed at her, warp forming at the between the thing's tip.

It fired as she reached for the door and in that moment Dia knew she was going to share Tait's fate, all because she was a split second too slow.

Yet at the warp travelled down the rest of the hall, almost travelling too fast for her eyes to track, the bot twitched...

...and the warp twitched with it, causing it to careen into the hallway and tear a chunk out of it.

Her jaw dropped.

_It can guide the Warp!? That's... that's incredible!_

She hadn't even known such a thing was possible, and now she _despearately_ wanted to study it. She wasted another full second staring at the thing before it began queueing up another Warp.

_How much power does this thing have!?_

But she knew the answer. Twenty people. It would take twenty average sized people feeding everything they had to fill it's reservoir. This gave it at least fifty warps before it would be forced to recharge.

It was a fact she wished she didn't know.

"Dia!" Moore's voice rang out in warning.

Dia slammed the door shut, turned, and began stumbling toward the access panel. Kalina and Malek had already crawled in while Moore had paused halfway to check on Dia. At seeing her stumble, he rushed to her.

"Give me that," he growled, tearing off the heavier pack from her back.

"Thanks."

She shifted Tait's pack to her back as he followed her.

He grunted at the weight, giving her an incredulous look. He didn't shoulder the pack. Instead, he rushed for the access tunnel and threw the pack in, following a moment later.

Dia was last and the only one who could hear the light click of a door opening. She glanced back in time to see the door slowly open.

She almost dove head first for the tunnel before realizing it would only leave her exposed. So instead she backed herself in, wasting a couple more seconds, enough to see the bot enter the room.

It immediately caught sight of her, swung its arm toward her, and started forming a new warp. She pressed the finger-sized panel in the tunnel with far more graescence that necessary, causing the panel to close with an audible snap.

She began crawling backwards as quickly as she could, not wanting to waste precious seconds turning around in the tight space.

Her mind raced to the beat of her heart, staring at the panel which refused to recede into the distance no matter how quickly she scuffled backwards.

_Can it see me? Will it follow? Can it follow? Does it need to? Can it open the hatch and blast us? What is heat light? Wait no, it can also see graescence. Can you see graescence through walls? Does it matter? Wait, can you see heat light throught walls? WHAT THE FUCK IS HEAT LIGHT? ...and why do I know it can see it? Maybe it can't open the panel..._

Too many questions, her mind spinning in circles. She continued to push her way backwards, her eyes glued to the closed panel. Kalina's light bounced around as she crawled, casting shadows from Malek, Moore, and herself. More than once the shadows tricked her mind her mind into thinking the panel was opening.

Each time her heart would stop a moment, and then race anew. Adrenaline drove her breath into shallow and quick panting.

It took a long time for her to accept that the panel would not open. She almost collapsed in relief when she realized it wouldn't. Her arms shook and tears began to leak from her eyes.

_No no no, not now. I can't loose it now. Not now. Dia, get a hold of yourself. You're fine. Everyone's fine—_

Tait flashed through her mind, eyes dulled in death, blood slowly pooling in his mouth, drowning him.

Dia groaned and drove her fists into her eyes.

_I'm fine, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Just a little more. It's not coming... it's not..._

She slowly got herself under control, barely suppressing the panic trying to claw its way out of her throat. She forced her breathing into even breaths that yet still trembled. Once her breath was under control, her heart started to follow, slowing down enough for her to think straight.

Then the light went out.

She froze, her faces twisted in terror.

"Kali?" Her voice came out wobbly. The darkness suffocated the sound.

"K... Kalina?" Her breath hitched. Tears fell from her eyes unbidden and unwanted.

She tried to turn around, but the pack was big and wedged into the wall. The harder she pressed, the more she pinned herself in place. She could feel the walls collapsing on her, suffocating her, burying her.

"Kalina? Kali? Kali? Kalina _Kali_ _KALINA_"

She was screaming the last of her words before light suddenly pierced the darkness.

"I'm here, Dia! What's—"

Dia lunged at her, breaking free and wrapping her arms around the other girls neck while she blubbered.

"It's alright, I'm here, I'm here" Kalina said, drawing her fingers through Dia's hair, "you're okay."

"You... you left me in the dark."

Kalina closed her eyes. "Gods... I am so sorry, Dia. I... we were... I didn't know you were so far back."

She ran her fingers through Dia's hair, over and over, shushing and repeating "it's okay" while Dia sobbed in waves, shuddering and shivering from the overload of emotions.

"Can we go now?" Malek interrupted, his voice cracked and strained.

Dia felt Kalina's head snap; she knew that glare.

"No he's right," Dia said, voice muffled in Kalina's shoulder.

She opened her eyes and extricated herself from the other girl. She felt surprisingly relieved and more than a little embarrassed. Of course they'd simply turned the corner, cutting off the light. Of course. Had she been turned around, she'd would still have seen it dimly in the distance.

Of course.

And yet that seed of terror dug deeply into her psych, refusing to dislodge.

"I'm sorry," Dia said. She wiped her face with her hand, smearing the mud on her face even more. "I just—"

"It's fine," Kalina said. "We're all... yeah."

Kalina looked down at the light in her hands for a second, then she offered it to Dia.

Dia took the light and wrapped both hands around it, feeding it her relief. Just holding it seemed to lift a weight from her soul, hiding terror behind brilliance, yet not bashing it completely.

"Uh... Dia?"

Dia startled at the sound of her name. She looked around and saw the others shielding their eyes.

"Oh sorry!"

She lessened the flow of graescence to the light enough that it wasn't blinding everyone, though it was still quite bright. She just couldn't bring herself to let it dim more than that.

"_Now_ can we go?" Malek said, his tone strained and impatient.

"Dia's first," Kalina said, sliding back into an authoritative role, "then me, Malek, Moore—"

"Oh come on! You've already crawled over my head once!"

Kalina leveled Malek a look that could wilt stone.

_Yep, that's the look._

He ground his teeth. "Fine," he snarled, "just as long as we get the hells out of here."

Dia nodded and began to crawl her way past the others. She paused at her own pack, which Moore had been pushing ahead of himself, but there was really no way for her to carry it.

Seeing the look on her face, he reached forward and squeezed her hand. "I'll take care of it."

She nodded and tried to give him a genuine smile, though she couldn't help but feel as though it were a paltry, thin thing covered by so many tears and dirt. She gave up and crawled over a grumbling Malek to take the lead.
