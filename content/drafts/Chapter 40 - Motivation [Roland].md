# 40 | Motivation [Roland]

The air was thick with dust that turned the sun red, kicked up by feet and fenced in by the inn's courtyard walls. It tickled Sal's noise and coated his throat, turning every inhale viscous, tempting him to distraction.

He slashed but his knife tangled in cloth, costing him a precious half-second. It did no damage, which hardly seemed fair; sharpened steel should at least cut cloth. He danced back against the anticipated counter, making sure to remain on the balls of his feet.

He dodged left but the incoming attack was too quick; he grunted as it struck his ribs. He brought his knife up to strike the arm and jump back, but his opponent was too quick and his attack met air... again.

"Good," Djrek nodded, a wry smile on his lips, "just because you're dead, doesn't mean you have to stop."

Sal worked hard to keep a scowl off his face while he rubbed a spot on his chest that what was sure to be a new bruise. It didn't work; Djrek chuckled a good natured sound, which only served to further irritate.

"That strike would have been fatal, but only after a while. You continued despite the pain. That's good; it shows focus."

Sal wiped sweat from his brow, then stared at a muddy forearm. His scowl deepened as he imagined his mud-streaked face.

He readied himself and ignored the flutter of annoyance that rose from seeing Djrek not on the balls of his feet, or sweating, or showing any more sign of effort than a stroll through the park. Fine, the man was unnaturally fast; he could live with that if only Djrek would sweat a little.

Sal lunged forward, shifted to the left, and jabbed at Djrek with a reverse grip. He would have been surprised had his attack landed, but it wasn't intended to. As Djrek leaned back to avoid the assault, Sal reversed his grip on the knife and speared forward. Or he would have, but Djrek struck his wrist mid-reversal, the precise moment his grip was weakest, causing Sal's hand to involuntarily liberate his knife. Djrek caught the knife before it fell more than a finger.

"Dammit." Sal was certain it would have worked on almost anyone else.

Djrek frowned. "Perhaps I should have let you finish that one."

Sal glowered and started a growl that descended into a hacking cough. He spit out what looked like mud, but it was hard to tell among the dust.

He thrust his hand out, palm up.

"No, you're right." Djrek nodded to himself. "That was a good move. A little sloppy on the reversal, but excellent progress, and your intuition was right."

Sal glanced down at his palm, then back up to Djrek.

Djrek paused, glanced at Sal's knife, then his face. "Do you smile anymore?"

Sal rolled his eyes. "Knife please."

"I think you must have smiled more at one time."

"You smile enough for both of us."

Djrek stretched his lips into a genuine grin. "I smile for me, not you."

"Well, can you blame me?"

"Because you lost your father?"

"Wha..." Sal blinked, frowned, dropped his hand. "No."

"Not for the only family you've ever known?"

Sal thrust out his hand again. "Knife please."

"But you're clearly mourning."

"Knife. Please." The words came through clenched teeth.

"Right, not family then." Djrek absently flicked the knife over and over as he studied Sal. He cocked his head and caught the last flip on the knife tip. He smiled. "The boy."

"Knife." Sal drew out the word.

"The one you were playing — ah, sorry — _exploring_ with that day. He was your friend?" Djrek shook his head. "No, of course he was. But he means something to you— meant something. What was his name?"

Sal snatched the knife from Djrek's fingers and stabbed center mass. It wasn't the most elegant attack, and it left him exposed, but Djrek pivoted out of the way and countered slowly enough that Sal could dodge and still regain his balance.

Infuriating. Sal stepped back and opted for a different strategy.

"Were you really going to give all those men a deal?"

Something like delight lit up Djrek's face. "I was."

"Then why kill them?"

"They attacked me, if you recall."

"Yeah but you could have let them know you weren't there to kill them."

"Irrelevant."

Sal's face pinched. "I'm pretty sure they would disagree."

"I'm sure they would, but it doesn't matter. You do not attack an Inquisitor."

"They wouldn't have attacked if they'd known."

Djrek sheathed his knife; his smile turned patient. "Again, it doesn't matter. To attack an inquisitor for any reason at all warrants death." He reached up and tapped his chin. "Think of it this way. How quickly do you think will spread the story of what happened?"

Sal looked down at his weapon and frowned. "Pretty damn quick."

"And how many Inquisitors do you think the Empire has?"

"Thousands?"

"Two hundred and eighty-two."

"That's it? For the whole Empire?"

"Now, if you heard that story and an Inquisitor walks in, what would you do?"

Sal tried to do the math but stopped when he realized the distribution was absurd. "Why so few?"

"The organization itself is much larger, but the role of an actual Inquisitor is one few can bear."

"Why?"

"Let's reframe the question: how many others will live because those men died?"

"So you killed them just to get a story?"

"I killed them because they attacked me."

"But you just said—" Sal shook off the frustration, pushed it down. "Okay, why not kill everyone then? Wouldn't that be a better story?"

Djrek shook his head. "That would be foolish; make yourself feared, but never a monster. Hope will stay a hand if to raise it destroys hope, but if you have no hope..." Djrek shrugged, "you have nothing to hold you back."

"But then it's what, random? You choose who lives and dies only to give false hope. That seems worse."

Djrek paused, looking thoughtful. "So technically," he raised his hands before him and flipped one palm up, "Mr Gastrick attacked me; by all rights, he should be dead." He flipped over both hands, so the other palm faced up. "Yet I judged him to be a stabilizing force for the Empire. His actions have consistently improved this town and lives of everyone who lives in it. As Inquisitors, this is what we want. To kill him would invite chaos and bring instability to the region, and _that_ is the very war against which we battle."

"So we kill people for a story because our goal is stability?"

"We're not psychopaths, Sal; we don't kill people for a story. But stability is paramount. Think about it: billions of lives depend on the Empire; it must be kept stable. Without us and what we do, there would be nothing but endless war. The lives we take now save billions; always remember that."

"Wait, doesn't the Empire make war?"

Djrek thrust at Sal with his knife; Sal hadn't even seen him unsheathe it. No longer on his balls, Sal couldn't shift out of the way before the attack struck him in the soft flesh between his ribs. It would have been a killing strike if he'd powered the knife.

Sal jumped back. "The hell— where did that even come from?"

"Have you ever boiled water?"

Sal huffed out an annoyed sound as he rubbed his ribs. He spared an angry glare at the knife then stopped suddenly; that was not the same knife Djrek had been using before. This one was shorter, he was certain.

Oh wait. He'd asked him a question.

He looked back up. "What?"

"Have you boiled water?" Djrek's eyes danced, as though he were in process of revealing some fascinating new revelation. He absently tossed his wooden knife from one hand to the other.

"Yeah, I guess." Frequently; it's not like his father would ever cook. But Djrek's joyful jumping between metaphors while randomly attacking with weapons that seemed to appear from thin-air was starting to grate on his nerves.

"Good. And have you tried to put a lid on a pot of boiling water?"

Sal bit back a sarcastic reply. Instead, he lunged at an angle to Djrek, and thrust three stabs in rapid succession, each aimed to put him off balance. It didn't work of course; Djrek shifted smoothly, just out of Sal's reach, without disturbing his perfectly balanced, yet flat footed poise. But at this point, Sal was just happy he could get Djrek to move at all. When they started training, it had gone much worse.

Djrek looked expectantly at Sal, acting like Sal's attack hadn't bothered him in least, which it probably hadn't.

Sal huffed. "Yes, I've put a lid on a pot. So what?"

"What happens?"

"It rattles."

"Why?"

Sal resisted the temptation to close his eyes and sigh; that would only invite another bruise.

"Because of the steam." His tone edged on frayed patience.

"Right, and what happens if you try to keep that steam in the pot?"

Sal frowned, brow pinched. "You can't. It'll just push its way out."

"Uh huh. And what would happen if you forced the lid close, clamped it shut?" Djrek clasped his hands together tight, fingers interwoven, then pressed them in until his knuckles began to show white.

"I guess it would build pressure."

"Until?"

Sal lifted a shoulder and let it drop.

Djrek jerked his hands away from each other, fingers splayed out.

"Oh, right," Sal said, "it would explode."

"And what does that tell you?"

Sal frowned; where had the knife gone? There was one sheathed, the stiletto styled design he normally wielded. He must have had hidden the other somewhere in that raven cloth of his — the same black cloth he was presently not sweating in — but he couldn't figure out where.

Sal diverted his attention back to Djrek. "If it's going to explode, why heat it up at all? Why not let the water be cold?"

Djrek's smile disappeared; his brow raised. "That's called death."

"You... lost me."

"Just like a body creates heat, people create strife. It's a natural part of living together. You can't get rid of it without killing the people in it."

"So war is a way of... what, letting the steam out?"

Djrek bobbed his head. "In a controlled manner."

"Seems like there should be a better way," Sal half-said to himself.

"There are several deterrents. For one, not only is the act—"

Djrek lunged again, interrupting himself to catch Sal off guard, but this time Sal was ready, mostly ready— well, he was as ready as he could be. He jumped to the side, trying to keep his balance but he was still off, his footing just wrong enough that he couldn't avoid the last thrust. Eager to avoid another bruise, Sal used his forearm to knock the thrust off target.

Also: where in all the forsaken gods had yet _another_ knife come from?

He was certain this was a third style of knife. This one was slightly curved; the others weren't. They were all wood, all gravtech, all absurdly expensive, and the man was pulling? — no, not pulling, more like _popping_ them into existence.

Djrek blinked slowly and let exhaled through is nose. "Not only is war expensive, but a War Writ must first be purchased, and that can cost as much as the war itself. Then it must be submitted to the Empire with no guarantee they will ratify it. Also, you just cut your arm off."

"Most people don't have gravtech weapons." Sal waved off the thought with his hand. "If it's so expensive, then why do it?"

Djrek scoffed. "Lots of reasons." He lifted his fist and began ticking off fingers. "Revenge, greed—"

Sal lunged, stabbed, reversed his grip, and slashed at Djrek, who kept just out of Sal's reach with two fingers still held up on his raised hand.

Djrek cocked his head. "Actually, that's about it."

"When do I get one of those?" Sal thrust his finger at Djrek's knife. He had at least three, after all.

Djrek raised a brow and with a half-cocked smile said, "You'll cut your arm off kid."

"Don't we get bracers or something? Armor? Anything but a cloth suit?"

Djrek managed to look mildly offended, though his tone was mocking. "What's wrong with our suit?"

"It's _cloth_."

"Is it now?"

"Yes?"

"You should check your assumptions. Also, what was your friend's name again?"

Sal snapped his jaw closed. He lunged again, this time angling across Djrek's path. As Djrek countered, Sal dove low, aiming to impale his opponent's leg. Djrek jerked the leg back as Sal went by, rolled off his shoulder, and came back up.

"What other... deterrents..." he repeated the word slowly, feeling it out, "are there for war?"

Djrek sighed. "The Royals themselves, but that's a complicated topic."

"Wait, the Royals? Aren't they the ones who start the wars?"

"Royals are encouraged to keep their disagreements as quiet? — no, that's not the right word. Let's just say there's a lot of incentive to resolve their issues by hidden knife or open duel. Hell, we don't even mind open skirmishes, assassinations, whatever. Their instability makes the Empire more stable so long as the incentives align and a big part of our job is ensuring those incentives align perfectly."

"I don't understand."

Djrek waved him off. "Doesn't matter. Suffice it to say, I'd rather be born a peasant than a Royal— much longer life expectancy. But you'll learn more about that later. For now, I want you to try something. Sheathe your knife; you won't need it."

Sal did so while taking two good steps back. With the way Djrek was materializing weapons, it was better to be a safe distance. He considered the space between them, then took a third step back.

"Have you ever formed a field warp?"

Sal shook his head but his eyes widened as he realized this was the shielder test. Soldiers took them, and just the idea sent shivers of excitement through him.

"What you will be doing is projecting your energy — the same you use to power all gravtech — in front of you. There are several... techniques I suppose you could say that people use to do this, but they're mostly just mental tricks."

Sal waited twelve seconds for Djrek to produce said tricks, but the man patiently out-waited him with a pleasant smile that made Sal want to rearrange his face with his now-sheathed knife.

A deep breath, just like Roland used to do, then slowly release it. He stared up at the dust-shrouded angry welt currently beating down on him. He reached up and drew his hand halfway down his face, then stopped abruptly. He pulled his hand back, stared at the mud on it, and silently groaned at what his face must now look like.

He jerked his head and glared at Djrek. "How are you not sweating?"

Djrek grinned as he brought up his arm and plucked at his sleeve. "It's high quality cloth."

Sal worked his mouth, took another deep breath, stabilized the boiling water in his stomach, and finally schooled his face into something resembling calm.

"And what tricks might these be?"

"Oh, I'll feed them to you if you need them, but I expect I won't."

"Right." No pressure. "And I just... put the energy where?"

"In front of you will be fine."

"In front. Of course, just like that."

"Just like that."

"Right."

Sal stared at the space in front of him for twenty three seconds.

"What tricks?"

"Come now, Sal. You're not even trying."

Sal guffawed. He didn't even know how to try, but clearly Djrek thought it was possible.

He focused intently, determined, focused; put the energy in front of him. Just like that. Put it—

"Do not clench your butt. That will do nothing except make you sore. In fact, don't clench anything— unless, of course, you normally clench your rear when turning on a light?"

"I do not."

"Great! This should be no problem then."

"Just like a light?"

"Just like a light."

"Right..."

A light. How did that feel? Like a different set of muscles, not clenching but pushing energy. So instead, he needed the energy to go into the space in front of him. Not a light, but in the space. Pushing the energy.

"Good good. So what was the boy's name, your friend?"

Sal shifted his gaze into a glare and turned it on Djrek.

"Ah ah." Djrek wagged his finger, then jabbed his finger at the empty in front of Sal.

In his other hand was held some kind of gravtech device — how much stuff did he carry in that coat of his? It vaguely reminded Sal of those prongs Djrek stabbed him with, but where the prongs would have ended, this continue out into a circle that repeatedly forked in on itself, producing smaller circles within the larger ones in an organic looking design.

So long as Djrek couldn't stab him with it, he was fine. Just the idea of those prongs made his stomach churn.

Sal directed his attention in front, and focused again on the space before him. After thirty-two seconds, Sal felt like he was doing something, maybe. But like pressing on a wall, that something was hard to quantify.

"And this boy was what? A lover— no, wait. How old are you, again?"

"Seventeen," Sal lied. His jaw clenched, but he kept his concentration.

Djrek grinned. "Not a lover. You don't have the rage for that. But _something_, something deeper, I think. What was his name, again?"

Sal shook his head and pressed in.

"He helped you get through a difficult time?"

Sal pushed a little harder.

"Ah, that's it. You don't mourn you father, but you mourn this boy. He helped you, and you lost him." Sal could practically feel Djrek nodding to himself. "Yes, he helped you deal with your—"

"Roland," Sal grated out between his teeth, "his name was Roland."

"Roland," Djrek breathed, almost reverently. "And Roland was to you?"

"He was my friend."

"I think more."

"No, I just... he... I was... nobody liked me. And father, he..."

Sal suddenly screamed out his frustration. This was why he didn't talk about it; the words just wouldn't work.

His frustration cut short at Djrek's awed smile. Sal followed his gaze to the space in front of him, which appeared bent, the light moving oddly within it.

Sal snapped out of it; the world snapped back.

"What was that?"

"A field warp and to be visible like that," Djrek shook his head; his smile grew, "a strong one."

"Does that," Sal shook off the emotion and calmed himself. Deep breath. "Does that mean I could be a shielder?"

"I daresay. Perhaps even a shaper."

"A shaper." Sal breathed the words, feeling them, tasting the impossibility. Shapers were rare magicians able to shape power into deadly forms. As a shaper, he could be— do anything he wanted.

"But that is not your path."

"What!? But—"

"Your path is here, to be an Inquisitor."

"But!"

"Sal, _listen_. Shaping requires decades of training and, yes, it will give you power, but it will not give you what want; it will not give you what you _need_."

Sal turned his back, jaw and fist clenched in fury, for he'd long since realized that Djrek held all the keys to his future.

"And what do I need?" He spat out the words into the dust.

For fifteen seconds his stomach broiled, his eyes burned. For fifteen seconds he hated the world and everything in it. He hated himself and the godling that stole all things from him. For fifteen seconds he would have burned it all down.

A hand squeezed his shoulder. He flinched, unable to avert the jolt of fear and panic surging through him, unable to contain the fury searing in its wake all things within him.

"You need order," Djrek said quietly from behind, "stability. That, Sal, is what we do; it is what the Empire is. You need to be an Inquisitor because you need to do what we do."

He paused and in that rare moment Sal lost track of time. The words struck bell that resonated with his soul, even as Djrek's hand weighed it down.

"A shaper will give you power, yes, but as an Inquisitor you will shape the world. It is the only way, the only path for you. Anything less will leave you empty and barren inside."

Djrek's words washed over Sal and quenched the inferno with him. In its wake Sal saw something clean and pristine; in its wake he found purpose.

Djrek let go his shoulder, stepped up beside Sal, and handed him a white handkerchief. Sal took it and stared at it for four seconds. He wiped his faced clean, folded the cloth neatly, and placed it in his pocket.

"Come," Djrek said, "we have a trip to make, a Royal to visit, and a world to make right."
