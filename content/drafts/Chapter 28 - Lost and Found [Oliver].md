# 28 | Lost and Found [Oliver]

Oliver blinked slowly, trying to take in the details through the haze clouding his mind. Blood splatters covered one side of the short entryway hall, barely lit by a dim, offset lamp burning a trickle of graescence in the hall behind him. Everything behind the entryway was shrouded in darkness.

The blood was old, at least a couple of weeks. Oliver would know. They'd gotten the place cheap from a local landlord that hadn't wanted to bother with cleaning up the blood from the previous tenants. Oliver had spent days scrubbing the stone clean along with the rest of the group.

They might have gotten it for cheaper, but Mike hadn't wanted to dispose of the bodies. Too much risk for disease, so the landlord had hired a few body snatchers, then tacked on the cost to their rent, plus a "small" fee for the inconvenience.

Mike had grumbled about that for a long time, going so far as making contact with a couple of local body snatchers in case something like this happened again. The landlord's fee had ended up being twice the cost of the snatchers.

It'd taken weeks for the smell to dissipate. That, or it had burned their noses insensate. Smell or no, nothing could scour the memory of that rancid scent from his mind.

He breathed deep through his nose, noting no smell, but the slightly stale air of a room left too long dormant. That was good. If some local boss had decided to take them out, they'd have left the bodies as a warning to others, rather like whoever last occupied the place.

Oliver took a step in and, on habit, placed his hand on a panel that led to a small light dangling precariously from a rusted hook jammed into a crack in the ceiling stone. From it ran a wire-thin lead following straight, jagged lines to the panel. The lead wasn't even attached to the stone, relying on the wood's natural rigidity to keep it in place.

The whole setup was detached, of course, the landlord too cheap to provide anything but a few modest lights in the hall. So the group had made a habit of feeding the light whenever someone walked in or out. Most times, it was enough to keep the light going throughout the day. Now it was long dead.

Oliver fed the panel, collapsed to his knees, and promptly threw up.

Or, he tried to. He spent minutes dry heaving while the graescence in his body went haywire, slowly subsiding until he could finally push himself back to his feet.

It felt as though someone had reached in and ripped out a part of his insides.

He tried to open his eyes and flinched at the flood of light assaulting him. It had never been so bright. Perhaps his eyes were still sensitive, but he'd been outside most of the day and his eyes had adjusted long ago.

He raised his hand against the light and took a few faltering steps into what had been their common living space. It was a circular room with small alcoves extending outward like knobby spokes on a wheel.

The privacy curtains were gone, as was any hint of bedding. In fact, there was no furniture at all, including the heater, which posed a problem.

"They...escaped, or ran?"

Oliver frowned. It seemed unlikely they'd escape from a boss raid. Most bosses weren't known for half-hearted measures and there was only one entrance. So, perhaps it was more of a warning?

The blood left a trail, which Oliver laboriously followed to Mike's alcove where it had pooled up against where his sleeping mat would have been.

A warning, then. A raid would have killed everyone.

Oliver leaned against the wall and tried to think, which was becoming harder. He was dizzy from hunger, not to mention whatever happened with graescence when he fed the panel.

He glanced at the lamp, which was still far too bright, almost like it held a week's charge. But his own graescence was fine now that it had settled, and there didn't seem to be any lack of it. He felt none of that bone-weary exhaustion whenever he pulled on too much of his graescence, not that he was prone to such behavior. Although, given his hunger-induced weakness, perhaps he was mistaking causes.

He dismissed the thought in favor of a more important line of reasoning. Where were his friends? They had several "safe houses" they could fall back to in case of trouble, most of which were simply abandoned habitats. Which one they used would depend on circumstance.

Most were nearby, but a few were further out, far enough that a boss would give up looking for them.

Oliver dismissed the local ones. If they were given a warning, it was most likely of the "get out" kind. Bosses claimed territories and tolerated little groups like theirs so long as they followed the rules and paid their dues. Run afoul, and you'd be chased out, though it wasn't normally a bloody affair.

Blood meant you'd offended someone, so likely Mike would have chosen a place far enough away their offense couldn't follow them. But not too farâ€”he was wounded after all, and given the blood, it was no light scrape.

Oliver discarded the furthest safe houses, leaving him with three or four to try.

He just had to get there.

A giggle escaped his lips, sounding flat against the stone. He could barely cross the room without passing out. How could he manage the leagues it would take to get to any one of their safe houses?

Easily, of course. So long as he didn't get lost again.

With barely more than the effort of thought, Oliver compressed the space between him and the door with a flash of color only he could see. One small step and he was through.

Two more steps, and he was blinking his eyes clear of the setting sun in a sky deepening into the blues of night. He didn't have much time, and he briefly considered going back to sleep off the night. But he didn't want to sleep on cold stone. A part of him feared he wouldn't wake up again.

He had leagues to go, and that forced a choice on him. He'd discovered two ways to compress space. The first and easiest way was to will his destination to him. It was a linear compression that required straight lines of sight, but at least he wouldn't get lost.

The second way was to twist space into a straw, then suck it through...or perhaps he was pushing himself through the straw? Either way, he could travel much, much further and direction didn't matter. The straw could be twisted around corners, through small holes, around objects. It was harder and more complicated, but one step could send him leagues.

It was also why he kept getting lost. Navigating through a narrow, twisted straw was not conducive to proper orientation, especially when his view through that straw was often skewed.

He would prefer using the linear method, even if it meant taking more steps. In this case, even with the compression, it would take him dozens, if not hundreds of steps to get to the closest of the safe houses he'd chosen.

He wasn't sure he could make that many steps without passing out.

Decision made, he willed the world to bend. Like before, sheets of color exploded from the marble to grope the surrounding space in a bubble. Space collapsed in on itself until the world grew distended, bulging grains of sands into small boulders.

He pushed on the bubble with his mind, causing it to distend and twist. Tension build up until it reached a tipping point, at which point the tension flowed out into a twisting straw that raced away from him.

The process took only a fraction of a second, though it felt much longer to him.

The "straw" was barely the width of a thread and all but invisible to anyone outside, something Oliver knew only intellectually. To him, he stood before a portal that displayed a twisted image of end of the straw that spun whenever he moved it. The edges of the portal wrapped around, pulling at the image and mixing it with his bloated surroundings.

It took intense concentration not to send the straw veering off course. In his present state that meant he often had to backtrack when he sent it spiraling in the wrong direction.

In one case, he flung the straw far up into the sky, earning himself a case of vertigo until he got it back to the ground. For a brief moment, he flew leagues above the sky, staring down at a small portion of the massive caldera. Endless green crops were dotted with black stone buildings, each housing thousands of slaves. The green disappeared into the horizon, with only a hint of the massive city towers the Empire had built to manage everything breaking up the horizon.

Below him was the cracked, upward slopping cliffs shielding the bowl of crops and slaves from the ravaging winds. Those cliffs extended for leagues in depth, slightly curving into the distance.

He's always known the caldera was large, but it was only then that the sheer _scale_ of the caldera impressed itself on him. His whole life, he'd lived within a tiny fraction of the protective cliffs, navigating massive ravines that appeared as hairline cracks from this distance.

Oliver could have easily transported himself to any part of the those cliffs or even to the green crops beyond if he wished. If he knew where to go. While he knew the general shape of the only haven on Ionia, he'd never seen a map and had no clue where to even start.

His only experiences were between those cracks. So he dove back in, navigating between corridors of stone, sometimes diving into natural formations, sometimes long, carved hallways as he crept closer to his destination.

He wasn't sure how long he spent doing this. It felt like hours, and the sun had long since abandoned the sky, sending a deep chill into his bones. Before long, it would grow cold enough to kill.

Oliver was shivering before he finally found his destination, a cavernous natural formation was little more than a large crack in the cliff that had been bricked up except for a pair of doors. It had probably been an improvised warehouse at some point until the owners realized it was too far out of the way to be worth it.

He tunneled under the door and confirming it was occupied, though the image was too distorted for him to make out their identities. After a moment, he decided it didn't matter. He was already freezing enough to that his body's shaking was making it difficult to keep his straw tunnel from collapsing.

He stabilized the end of the straw, took a single step that stretched over leagues, and appeared next to a startlingly familiar boy.

Oliver was standing just behind and to the side of the boy, giving him a perfect profile view of that stupidly sharp nose.

"You bastard!" Oliver tried to shout, though it came out more like a loud rasp.

"Gah!"

"You sold me a badâ€”"

"Demon!"

"â€”leaâ€”"

Oliver's head snapped back when the boy punched him.

---

"...even alive?"

Muffled voices drifted across a vast expanse, distorted and echoing strangely in Oliver's ears.

"...thought he was dead..."

He was not dead. At least, he was pretty sure he wasn't. Whether that continued seemed to be an open question, but he wasn't sure he cared.

It felt nice to just lay there, and he might have continued drifting if the voices would stop increasing in volume.

"...can't believe you hit him."

"I'm telling you! He just...appeared."

"You're an idiot. Literally, the worse door guard, ever."

Ah, Andrea. A smile twitched his lips. It was nice hearing her verbal abuse aimed at someone else.

"He's awake, guys," said a quiet voice, Tabbie.

"The door didn't open, Annie. He was just...there. I swear it!"

Silence stretched as Oliver tried not to laugh. He knew _exactly_ the look Andrea was giving him...the boy. Dammit, what was his name?

"Guys?" Tabbie tried again.

"An...Andrea. Sorry."

No, not that name. Wrong person. Why was he so bad at remembering names?

"This just makes my point, you git! You didn't even notice him open the door!"

"Lay off, Andrea," Mike said in a deeper baritone. "He's still new."

Oliver opened his eyes, which was far harder than he thought it should be. A blur of brown and gray greeted him, indistinct until he blinked enough to resolve into lightly less blurry people standing around him.

Tabbie was closest. She'd pressed a cool compress to his forehead, and was the first to notice him open his eyes. She gave him a sad smile, the kind people give you when you're dying. That might concern him if she were anyone else, but she always had sad smiles for as long as he'd known her.

"I don't know why you're even here. This is all your fault, anyway." Andrea had raised her voice, glaring at...the boy whose name Oliver still couldn't remember. The two of them stood near a wall, glowering at each other.

Mike stood leaned into a corner, resting the back of his head against the wall. He wore a tired expression as he watched Andrea and...bad-lead-boy. Oliver couldn't help but notice he held his left arm stiffly.

With a sigh, he pushed off the wall. "We've been over this Ann," Mike said in a tired tone. "The lead was good, and Ollie shouldn't have gone off on his own."

Mike wouldn't be saying that if Oliver had actually succeeded...

...actually, never mind. Oliver could have brought back a chest of riches and Mike _still_ would have complained about teamwork.

"See!?" The lead-boy leaned in toward Andrea, who responded with a look of disgust.

She turned to Mike. "He could say anything he wants with Ollie gone."

"Hey! I got stung justâ€”"

"What reason would he have to lie?"

"Exacâ€”"

"To cover his ass! So he could mooch off of us? Because he's a gods-cursed moronâ€”"

"Hey! I'm right here!"

"â€”Because he has no friends. Becauseâ€”"

"Would you stop it!" The bad-lead-boy shouted.

Andrea's face flattened as she slowly turned back to him, eyes narrowed. "I have a long list."

The boy scoffed, shaking his head.

"I'm going to go...guard the door. Or something," he said, stalking off.

"Yes, you do that. Guard that door. Maybe notice when someone walks through it this time."

"Ann, give him a break. For all our sakes, please."

Andreas lips pursed into a scowl, but she didn't respond to Mike, too busy boring her eyes into the stupid-boy's back.

Tabbie had dipped a stone spoon into a bowl and brought it over, waiting patiently for Oliver to notice. He pushed himself up to sit on his bed, which was little more than a couple of worn blankets folded on the floor.

He absently took the spoon and slurped on a thin soup that...tasted like heaven. After months of living off of moss, he couldn't help himself, he moaned.

"Oh! You're awa..." Andrea's eyes narrowed dangerously. "You..." Her breathing picked up. "You, you sand whore!"

"Hey!" Although Oliver's objection wasn't too heated. He'd expected this.

"Do you have _any_ idea of what your stupidity has done to us?"

Oliver turned a pleading gaze to Mike, who just shook his head slowly.

Oliver sighed. "It was a bad lead."

"It was NOT!" a shrill voice echoed from across the room. Steps heralded the return of the boy-who-gives-out-bad-leads.

"You said he was going to be gone."

"I _said_ he'd be gone in a tenday. _You_ went the _very next day_!"

Did he say that? Oliver frowned, then shook his head. "No. No, you saidâ€”"

"Ten. Day. Tenday. I said it like, twice."

"No, no no no. You said..." Had he said tenday? Oliver wasn't so sure. Maybe he had? No. He was sure. "You said he was gone tomorrow."

"I said they were packing up tomorrowâ€”or...the next day, whatever. I was _trying_ to back up my claim. I _said_ you could check it out and see I was right. I sure as burning hells didn't tell you to try to steal from them on the day everyone was running around packing shitâ€”and how? How did you even get in there? They had people crawling all over the place!"

Yeah, they did. Ollie had thought it was unusual, but it only made the challenge more fun. Still, he was sure the boy had said...he did say, didn't he?

...dammit. He wasn't sure.

"Ollie," Andreas voice was calm in a way that sent a hundred warning bells off in Ollie's head. "They're hunting us. They almost got Mike."

"He was gushing blood when he came in," Tabbie whispered to herself, eyes distant.

"They would have gotten me if Josh hadn't warned me in time."

_That_ was his name. Right. That sounded right. Also...

"Why is he here?" Ollie said, irritated.

"Because they think I'm part of your group, you stupid littleâ€”"

"Which you're not," Andrea spun on the boy-who... Oliver sighed. Josh. She spun on Josh. He preferred him as bad-lead-boy.

Mike pushed between Andrea and Josh, which Ollie thought was a dangerous place to be. The pair looked ready to draw knives. Josh, though, just shook his head and walked away, presumably to go guard a door.

Something about that almost made Oliver laugh. No door would ever keep him out, not ever again.

"Boss Lodstrum is holding a grudge, a big one," Mike spoke slowly in a level voice. "He's put a bounty on all of us, anyone seen with you. We've lost four safe houses. With the bounties, people keep snitching. This place is the longest we've managed toâ€”"

"Because there's literally no one around," Andrea spoke over Mike in exasperation. "It's two hours to the nearest market, if you can even call it that. We have no money, nobody to steal from. We're _starving_, Ollie, all because you just had to go it alone and try to steal from under the nose of a _god's forsaken regional boss,_" she all but shouted before Mike placed a hand on her arm. She let out a growl, then huffed. "Why, Ollie? We've always been smart about our jobs."

Oliver blinked at the tirade, then let his eyes drift down to the soup Tabbie had placed in his lap. It really was thin, with barely any chunks of meat or...anything really in it.

Why? Why would he want to get out of the endless cycle they were stuck in? Why would he want a score big enough to give them an out? Why would he risk all their lives for their future?

She wasn't wrong. They _had_ always chosen safe jobs, which mean they were stuck choosing safe jobs. Safe jobs weren't a way out, but they were the reason this crew had lasted as long as it had. Big jobs meant big risk. Risky jobs usually meant a short walk to watering the sands.

But sometimes you heard rumors. You heard about the crew that pulled off a big job and retired, or moved into an enclave, or became a boss themselves. You always hear about the ones who make it out. And even if you know the chances are slim, you can't help but wonder...

Why not me?

So yeah. Oliver saw an opportunity and took a chance. And he didn't tell them because they'd have said no. Too risky. Everything was too godsdamned risky. And that's why they were stuck, why they'd always be stuck.

But even as a coal of anger flared in his chest, guilt immediately washed it away. These people weren't just some crew, they were his friends. And he'd let them down.

"I'm...sorâ€”wait!" His friends! How had he missed it. "Where's Bran?"

Andrea went still, then glanced at Mike who returned a disappointed look along small shake of the head.

She sighed, suddenly looking worn and thin. "He's at that so-called market, trying to find food."

Was she really going to let him believe Bran died?

"You're such an asshat," he said, the words out of his mouth before he could take them back.

But instead of the expected verbally abusive response, she just stared at him. Then she turned and walked away. It hurt more than anything she could have said.

"Listen, I get it." Mike knelt, placing a hand on Oliver's shoulder. "Everyone wants that one score that'll set them up for life. But Ollie, it's a lie. It's always a lie. People like us don't get out. There's no 'out' to go to. But..." he squeezed gently, "that doesn't mean we can't have a good life. We can. We have each other, and as long as we stick together, we can make something better than...this." He gestured at the massive empty cavern. "Just please, don't go off trying to steal from a boss again, okay?"

Try? Oliver suddenly felt the weight of the marble in his hand, hidden under the blanket.

They didn't know. They thought he failed.

A new thought began to form, an ugly thought. If they did know, they'd make him give it back. He wasn't sure he would survive that.

They could never know about his marble.

"Yeah, sorry. I just...you're right. It was stupid. I won't do it again." Because the next time he won't be caught.

Mike nodded. "Rest. _Eat._ You look like you've been through hell, but you're safe now. We'll get through this; we'll figure it out together, alright?"

Tabbie came back with another bowl of soup and switched it out for the empty one. Oliver hadn't even realized she'd left. He glanced at the bowl, then back at Mike.

"Yeah, together."

Mike squeezed his shoulder and smiled before standing back up and walking over to Andrea. Oliver watched them while he absently slurped the soup. He had only one consuming thought:

Who would he steal from next?
