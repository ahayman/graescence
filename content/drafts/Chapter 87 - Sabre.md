# 87 | Sabre

Roland sent Anna tumbling off him in a mumbled cry of startled outrage. Thunder rolled off the mountains and echoed throughout the valley. Roland sat still, listening carefully.

“Gods Roland, what—”

He held up a shadowy hand to forestall her and earned a silent glare in return. He was too focused on the sound to pay much attention to her, although her look told him he’d end up paying her back with interest. Depending on how she wished to receive that interest, he might end up enjoying it.

He shrugged off the errant thought.

Aside from the thunder, the night was silent. No wind, no rain, and there was enough light to see, which meant the cloud cover had fled, and Ionia was out. But the night’s silence was unusual and familiar. He knew this silence, and his heart began to race as an anticipatory smile crept upon his face.

He jumped out of bed, taking the sheets with him and out from under Anna. She let out an undignified squawk as she tumbled lightly, but he was already pulling on his pants. She recovered and crawled over to him, making him feel both aroused and nervous. She looked angry as she sat on folded legs.

“Roland, just _what_ do you think you’re doing?”

“Trap,” he replied while pulling his shirt over his head.

“Wwww... what?” She rubbed her eyes and yawned.

“Trap.” He pulled on his boots.

“Would you please use more than single-word answers?”

He grabbed his harness, threw it over his shoulder, and then fastened it around his waist. His mind was distant, already on the hunt ahead as he tried to think through all the scenarios he might encounter. The sabre would likely be out of the trap by now or would be soon. Really, it depended on what part of its body was entangled. There was a slight chance the trap might have caught it in such a way that it couldn’t escape. He snorted softly to himself. He was never that lucky.

He was attaching his sword to the harness when he realized that Anna was still staring at him. She looked angry and... afraid? Had she said something?

Something pressed against his leg, and on habit, he knelt down to pet Skyra as he reached for his knives with his other hand.

The worst scenario, of course, would be the trap missing the sabre completely. He wasn’t entirely sure he’d be able to catch up to it if that happened. He ground his teeth. It needed to die one way or another.

“Roland, you’re scaring me,” Anna said in a quiet voice that pierced his thoughts.

He’d already mounted his knives and had just grabbed the caster. He stopped and looked at her strangely, not quite comprehending her words. His mind kept circling back to the hunt, and he had to take a moment to force them to stillness so he could replay what she’d said.

“The trap has sprung. I need to hunt.” Why did she look so unsettled?

“If it’s been sprung, then what’s the rush?” Her tone was patient but still betrayed an underlying nervousness. “It’s not going anywhere, right? That’s the whole point of a trap.”

He snorted and allowed a smile. “No, it’s probably already escaped. I need to hunt _now_.”

He briefly considered grabbing his coat. It was possibly the coldest part of the night, but the coat would slow him down, and against a sabre he would need all the speed he could manage. He decided to leave it. Better to be a little cold than dead.

He made to leave when he realized Anna was pulling on her own breaches.

“No,” he said firmly. “Stay.”

“*Excuse* me?” Her eyebrows flew up, and her back stiffened as she bristled at his audacity to command her. For just a moment, she was nothing less than a queen, her posture regal and commanding. No matter that she was still half-naked, Roland thought she could command an army from her posture alone.

For a moment, he almost forgot about the sabre completely. He had to force down a strong urge to do a different kind of hunt tonight.

“Please don’t follow me. You’ll only get hurt.”

He turned and left without waiting for a response. He needed to go now. Any further delay would risk the hunt. So he didn’t see her face harden with determination, but he did hear several well-spoken curses emanate from behind him.

He might have _pulled_ himself into the hunt right then except he wasn’t the only one who’d woken. Alister, Stan, and Jonah all stood in a circle, huddled and shivering in small clothes and hastily donned boots as they engaged in a discussion too low for Roland to make out.

What he could make out was the sound of Fin snoring, and he wasted a precious moment marveling at the man’s apparent ability to sleep through anything. He barely spared the group a glance before he sprinted in the direction he’d heard the trap. He heard Jonah and Alister shout at him, but he didn’t bother to discern their words.

As soon as he was out of sight, he _pulled_ himself into the air and arrived at the trap within a few seconds. He felt freedom and relief at letting loose. It would have taken at least a quarter-hour to trudge through the snow.

He also felt incredible cold. Perhaps leaving the coat was premature.

He first examined the trap, which was little more than some rope attached to a sapling that had been strapped to the base of a very thick tree. He grunted in appreciation at the crack in the trunk from where the sapling had snapped back. Whitewood was impressive stuff.

As expected, the rope had been stretched and severed. From the frayed end, Roland guessed that it had taken the sabre a few minutes to free itself. There was a chance the trap had hurt it, but he couldn’t count on that. A braided rope would have stretched, taking a bit of the bite out of the trap, and Sabres were tough animals with bodies very much accustomed to sudden shifts of direction.

He _pulled_ himself back into the air and took a moment to locate the tracks. The sabre had been circling the camp, perhaps scouting. He slowly tracked it out from the trap, which led almost directly away from the camp.

While he longed to give chase, it was worth taking the time to learn everything he could from the tracks, so he followed them slowly. He first noticed the gate of the animal was off, which suggested it had been injured after all. He lowered himself and analyzed the depth of each footprint to confirm that it favored its front left leg.

Back in the air, he tracked the trail again, moving faster than before but still careful to not lose the tracks and waste precious time. Most notably, the trail would disappear with deep prints, only to reappear in a piled-up mound to start off a new direction. He’d never seen that behavior before. He wasn’t sure if the sabre was using a fleeing tactic or intentionally obscuring the trail. Perhaps both. Several times Roland had to waste precious moments finding the new trail. His only consolation was that the sabre was likely slowed down by its injury. Otherwise, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to catch it.

He’d tracked the animal for almost an hour before he noticed troubling signs. First, its gate had evened out. Either it had healed, or the injury had not been so bad as he’d first thought... or it had feigned the injury. He couldn’t decide which was worse.

It also had stopped its random jumps, so that now followed a very clear and clean set of prints. Finally, the tracks had been arcing to the left ever so slightly, almost imperceptible as it weaved through the trees. It had taken him quite a while to see the trend, and now that he did, his mind struggled to make sense of it.

It could have been merely adjusting its path toward whatever place it was fleeing to, but why would it be so gradual? He’d have expected one of its jumps to simply correct its direction. Perhaps it didn’t realize it was practically leaning to the left, its injury unconsciously guiding it? He winced at the theory. It might fit the pattern, but he’d long since learned never to attribute to chance what might instead be malice. The unease he felt suggested malice.

He stopped suddenly as a cry echoed through the night. It was a women’s voice and one he knew. The truth of the tracks came crashing down on him.

The sabre hadn’t been fleeing at all.

It had been leading him away from the camp, using its own tracks to slow him down and waste time while it circled back for the kill. Had it even been injured at all? He cursed himself for his own stupidity while he _pulled_ himself toward the cry he heard, rocketing through the forest at a deadly speed.

Panic settled as a wet blanket around his shoulders and threatened to dull his mind, which circled back on itself over and over as he replayed his mistake, and the cry he heard. His mind repeatedly thrust on him images of Anna torn apart.

He clipped a branch, hidden as it was from Ionia’s light by the coverage of another tree, or perhaps he’d been too distracted to see it. He careened off course and barely missed another as he _pulled_ to correct his motion, wasting precious seconds simply because he’d been too distracted to pay attention.

He knew in his gut that those seconds wasted were the end of Anna’s life. If only he’d been quicker, if only he’d been less distracted, maybe then she wouldn’t have been torn—

No.

He stopped and held himself a dozen feet off the ground. He unclenched his jaw and emptied his mind, using every ounce of his will to push aside the thoughts which threatened to drown him. While the seconds ticked by, he sunk into the silence of the forest and opened his senses.

A slight breeze caressed his skin, which prickled in response. It was deadly cold, his breath sending out small puffs of steam that seemed to crystallize in the air, barely visible under Ionia’s orange light.

He slowed his breath and embraced the cold, inviting it to seep into him, chilling his mind and clearing his thoughts.

A branch rubbed against another, its sound a light rubbing in his mind. A clack in the distance, the break of a twig. A slight rustle of leaves, a tree under a breeze he couldn’t feel. Something nearby rustled, perhaps in the tree, but small, inconsequential. Another cry echoed.

There, he had it.

Roland shot into night, his senses still open and aware, mind empty, emotions dead except for the small ember of excitement for the hunt, which flared in the chase.

He was the monster in the night, the unseen predator. Tricked or not, the sabre would die tonight.

Within minutes he’d found Anna alone in the center of a small clearing, eyes wide on the verge of panic, her body tensed, a throwing knife in each hand. She favored a leg, and he noted a torn pant with wetness around it. The sabre had disabled her to prevent her from running, not that she could have outrun the thing.

Why hadn’t it killed her quickly? He’d never known the animal to toy with its prey. It had always preferred a quick and clean kill.

He came in from behind her and noticed another gash raked across her back.

Rage threatened the empty at the sight of her injury. He forced it back, embracing the silence and the cold. Allow that dam of emotions to break, and both he and Anna would die tonight.

But where was the Sabre?

He came into the clearing from above and behind her, aiming to land just to her left when she spun, flung her hand out, and from it, a blade flew at him with deadly accuracy. Instinct took over, and he veered off to the left, but the knife still managed to clip his shoulder. Somewhere in the back of his mind, a sense of awe flared up of Anna.

That had been an incredible throw. And now he knew why the sabre hadn’t killed her yet.

He landed several paces left of his original target and piled up snow under his feet. It was a little more clumsy than he was accustomed to, but then he did just narrowly avoid death.

“Roland,” she breathed the words and looked at him as though he were a ghost, “but how?”

“Later,” he growled. He detached his sword and winced at the cut in his shoulder. He walked over to her as his eyes scanned the darkness. “Back to back,” he commanded. She nodded and turned her back to him.

He’d left his sense open, especially to gravics, and so he felt the sabre’s approach, though barely in time to react. He had no idea who its target was, so he _pushed_ on Anna and sent them both flying out barely a moment before sabre landed where they’d been standing.

Anna grunted in surprise and failed to compensate for the sudden motion. She dropped her knives and rolled over several times in the snow. He felt sort of bad about that, but maybe the snow would help slow her bleeding. That was something, at least.

She recovered quickly, and two more knives appeared in her hands before she’d made it to her feet. She looked confused and disoriented a moment, but her eyes widened as she saw the horse-sized sabre where she’d been only a moment ago, it’s head resting taller than her own. It was that or Roland, who’d arrested his motion with several anchors that left his whole body suspended a couple paces above the ground.

The sabre crouched briefly and launched at Anna. Perhaps it thought to remove the weaker of the two, but it was a critical mistake.

Roland shifted his anchor from Anna to the sabre and _pulled_ to yank the animal back toward himself. He then shifted himself out of the way, hardened his other anchors, and used himself as a pivot to whip the animal around toward a tree.

He hadn’t truly expected the throw to do much, but he was after more than just damage. Information was nearly as valuable, and how the beast reacted would settle a question he’d had from his prior hunt of the beast. Specifically, he wanted to know if it could shift direction _mid-air_ or if it had to launch off something solid.

Proving the negative was more difficult than he’d anticipated. The animal didn’t exactly shift direction, but it did somehow manage to re-orient itself with its feet aimed at the tree. It landed softly and launched itself back at him at a speed he barely registered. He yanked himself out of the way but exposed his right side to claws that raked across his ribs. He winced at the pain, but it was shallow. He could ignore it.

He pulled on the animal before it had a chance to land in an attempt to once again catch it off guard. He fully intended to cut the damn thing in half. It _should_ have worked, yet somehow his weapon found nothing but air as the infernal beast twisted around the blade. He watched in disbelief as it barely missed a tree and disappeared into the darkness.

He growled in frustration. Did it or did it not just shift in mid-air? He couldn’t decide. It might have been simple acrobatics, but damn if that wasn’t an impressive maneuver then. He shifted his eyes back to the tree. It really should have hit that.

He shook his head in annoyance and shoved aside the thought.

He’d thrown it back out into the dark, beyond where he could see, and while Ionia still cast its light, the sabre had a coat mixed of white and black that blended into the snow and dark equally. Somehow he’d lost his anchor to the beast, though by no intention of his own.

All that work only to end up exactly where he’d begun. No, not exactly. He had some gashes on his side and more questions than answers. He grudgingly admitted that the sabre had taken the first point.

He wasted several moments attempting to find it again when he caught motion out of his periphery. Of course, it wouldn’t attack him again — that would be too obvious — and he’d completely forgotten that Anna even existed.

He spun himself around and anchored to the beast as it flew toward Anna from above with razor sharp claws outstretched to eviscerate her. Yet his anchor somehow _slid_ off it, and with nowhere to go, it snapped back and stunned him. That was new.

He watched helplessly as Anna released a knife at the white blur and launched herself at the beast. His gut clenched as he prepared to watch his lover die. Yet she somehow avoided its claws as it overshot its mark.

His eyebrows lifted as he realized what she’d done.

She hadn’t launched her self at the sabre but under it. She twisted her lunge so that she faced up, and took the opportunity to throw another dagger at its soft underbelly as it passed, though he didn’t see if she’d hit it.

The sabre crashed into the ground beyond and rolled a few times before coming back to its feet. There was blood on its front left shoulder joint. She’d hit it in exactly the right place cause the animal to collapse.

He should have taken advantage of the opportunity, but he was simply too stunned that she’d managed to stay alive and wound the beast. He grudingly assigned the second point to Anna and noted with irony that he was still at zero.

He growled as he launched himself back at the beast.

It dodged but not quite as fast as before. He managed to clip its hind quarter and score a deep gash.

That should slow it down.

He half expected it to recover and launch itself back at him — or Anna, he really needed to remember she was there — but instead, it continued into the forest in full retreat. The sabre had no issue retreating to fight another day, a kind of wisdom he’d found lacking among most of the forest’s denizens.

He let out a savage noise that was half shout, half laugh, half animal growl. It was _his_ now, he owned it.

He launched himself and angled up to take advantage of height. He would use its own tactics against it and attack from above where it would least expect him.

Even wounded, it moved through the forest with a kind of fluid grace he could only dream of achieving, at least on the ground, for amongst the trees was a different matter entirely. The distance between them shrank quickly.

He spotted glistening in the snow, an indication that the animal was bleeding out. He smiled in anticipation. It wouldn’t be long now with it weakening from bloodloss. His heart began to race, and his breath quickened in anticipation.

Oh, he was going to enjoy this.

Within a few minutes, he’d caught up with it. It had slowed too much, which was suspicious. He moved above it and launched himself down at the beast, his sword positioned to take off its head.

It was a feint, or the beast was that good, but it dodged out of the way and forced him to _pull_ hard to arrest his inertia before he crashed into the ground.

He _pulled_ himself away from the expected attack, just barely in time to dodge the sabre’s claws. It should have struck him, but its wounds had slowed it.

He launched himself up, then over, and then finally back down for another attack from above. It dodged again, but he’d anticipated that and predicted where it would dodge to from the angle he’d lured it into thinking he was at.

He came down hard and cleanly severed the beast’s head. His blade continued down to sever the stone rock the sabre had stood on and then embed deep into the forest floor. At the same time, he _pulled_ hard to arrest his motion before he bombed the forest floor with his body.

And that was it. It was dead, the hunt was over.

He stared at the head. It had been cast into amber by the moon’s light. Its blood looked black as it slowly inched its way down the slight incline of the stone before it dripped to the forest floor to be consumed.

It should have fought more, fought better.

The head was massive, larger than a horse. Its teeth were razor sharp, backed by jaws that could render a man in two. Its claws could have amputated his arm, its speed surpassed almost anything in the forest.

It had died in mere minutes.

Minutes. That was it. That was all it could give him. Just minutes worth of a fight and barely scratches in return. It should have been harder than this.

His victory turned vinegar in his stomach.

This was what Rose wanted, for him to savor being the monster, the killer. He knew, deep down, that it was the entire point of these hunts. His only escape from training — from her — was to become the monster she was making him into. He hated it, hated her for doing it to him, and hated himself for loving it.

He loved being that monster. He loved the fight, looked forward to the challenge, relished the pain. He _needed_ these hunts, this freedom.

He was strong here, just as he’d promised he would be so long ago. He was no longer a child that whimpered as he was torn apart by beasts. He was free here. He was strong. He was the monster that tore apart others. He was the beast now, and for all the freedom it had promised, a collar yet adorned his neck.

He growled and violently shook his head. These were old thoughts, bad thoughts. He’d spun them a thousand times, only to find them endlessly turning back on him until he’d tied himself into knots.

He felt dirty now. Always dirty with these thoughts. How quickly he’d moved from light and joy back into the mud that was his mind.

No. No, dangerous thoughts, push them down, focus on the task.

He closed his eyes and focused on his cycle. He spotted all the minor places where it’d been torn or frayed from his wounds and pushed the cycle into them with prejudice. The pain was intense, either a searing cold or a freezing heat that set his nerves on fire and seared them close.

The pain washed over him in waves. He welcomed it, allowed it to consume his emotions, and burn away the poison. It was a terrible cleansing fire, and it then it was done. Just like the hunt, it was over too quickly. It couldn’t feed him what he needed. All his wounds were minor, and now there was nothing left to heal, no more fire to cleanse.

He still felt dirty.

He stared down at his sword with longing. A simple twitch, a gash just deep enough, and he could welcome the fire again. He could purge all of these emotions. He fed his weapon and formed the simplest of edges. He lifted it.

A distant voice rang out through the wood. It was hardly there, easily ignored, of no consequence.

He brought the tip of the sword down into his arm and watched the blood well up. He felt nothing. How odd that the assault would yield no pain except for the healing of it.

His name rang through the woods. It was distant, but it pulled at him, and it was not enough.

He scored another gash but deeper than before. Finally, he felt pain. His bone. He’d clipped it, and the ache of that was deep. He closed his eyes and relished the ache.

The voice persisted, louder, insistent. He looked up and blinked away his confusion.

Anna.

Suddenly the pain felt wrong. He felt wrong like he’d betrayed her somehow, betrayed the gift she gave him.

He pushed his cycle into his self-inflicted wounds and endured the searing. This time it cleansed nothing. The dirt had been hidden by the awareness of a single name, or perhaps, it had never existed, revealed false by that same name.

He’d been on his knees, though he didn’t quite recall how he got there, so he got up and anchored the sabre’s head. He heard his name again, and it gave him a direction to go.

She was out there, alone, in the most dangerous forest in the world, searching for him while he wallowed in his self-pity. She had to be utterly terrified, yet still, she continued to cry his name because she cared for him.

He closed his eyes for a moment, relished the feeling, and then _pulled_ himself back toward his love.

He found her several minutes later, limping slowly through the snow and calling out his name. She was shivering. She’d wrapped her jacket and her arms tightly around herself, but that proved poor insulation with the holes newly opened on her back. In her hands were knives, but he wondered if she could even throw them now. He dared not test that.

He moved back a little and lowered himself to the ground. She must have heard something, for she froze, and her eyes darted nervously around. Her body tensed up as he walked into view as though to throw a knife, but as soon as she saw him, she cried out in relief and collapsed to her knees. He instictually _pulled_ himself over to her, covering the distance between them in seconds.

“Dammit, Roland... what the hell?”

He stopped, confused for a moment until he realized he was still carrying the head of the sabre. He tossed it aside. Why did he grab it anyway?

“Are you ok?” He closely looked her over. She was still shivering, and while much of the blood had frozen, he could still see it slowly seeping out of her leg.

“Am _I_ ok!? Gods below, Roland, are you— oh no, no. You... I _saw_ it get you.” She reached over to his side and fumbled with her fingers where it had clawed him. The shirt was torn and wet, but of course, he bore no wounds.

“It barely missed but you’re shivering.” He leaned in and began to rub her arms.

“No, don’t change the subject.”

“It was dark.” She grunted something that may have been acceptance, but her eyes betrayed suspicion.

Her teeth clattered. “Not _that_ dark and I saw... saw... you m..mm..move like a demon. How?”

He flinched at her words. “Stan called it an innate trait.”

“Y y y... you have... trait?”

Her whole body was shivering. The only thing that had kept her warm was the effort of finding him. Now that she’d collapsed, her body was succumbing to the cold and blood loss. He tried to rub her arms, but that was like spitting on a bonfire to put it out.

Fire. He needed to get her back.

“Shhh, yes,” he said tenderly and then picked her up. She tried to protest but still huddled into him.

“Warm...”

He stood up and clutched her as closely as he could. His own body wasn’t much warmer than hers. He needed to get back to camp quickly. He anchored himself to several Whitewoods and then, just to be safe, anchored her to him.

“Woah...” her eyes fluttered open, “weird.” They closed just as quickly, and she curled up closer to him.

He _pulled_ himself up just enough to follow her trail. He didn’t know where the camp was, but it couldn’t be too far, and he could follow her tracks back.

He cursed himself for his stupidity.

In his ferver to track the sabre, he’d lost his own position. If he’d kept proper track of where he was, he’d have known what it was doing long before it reached Anna. His chest tightened as he felt guilt wash over him for his carelessness. It was his own failure that allowed her to be hurt like this.

Familiar voices pulled him out of his reverie just as he came to the site of the original confrontation with the sabre. He set himself down and walked into an argument.

“It just doesn’t make sense,” Fin’s tone carried an edge of frustration, “It’s like the damn thing simply appeared randomly.”

“It jumped, I think,” Stan said.

Jonah nodded. “I agree, I must have been jumping around. Roland hinted the beast was very agile.”

“But why over here? There are no other tracks here... and Anna’s tracks... uh...”

The two others turned to follow Fin’s surprised look at Roland. All three of them seemed stunned a moment before they registered what Roland was carrying.

“I swear to the forgotten gods, Roland. If she’s...” Fin stalled at seeing her shiver.

Jonah quickly removed his own coat and flung it over her, to which Roland gave a grateful nod. “She ran out here after you before we could gear up.”

“She needs warmth. Do you think they started up the fire?”

He nodded. “The whole camp was up when we left. Someone will have lit it.”

Roland nodded and moved to go, but Stan placed a hand on his shoulder. “I can help carry her.”

Roland shook his head, “No, I can move faster alone. I’ll meet you at the camp.”

Fin’s eyes widened. “Woah, you’re gonna leave us out here with that... that _thing_ hunting us?”

Roland shook his head again. “No, it’s dead. I cut its head off. Follow Anna’s trail if you want proof, but I’m taking her back to camp.”

He walked away and then _pulled_, leaving behind several more questions on their lips. At this point, he didn’t care what they knew about him. His only concern was that Anna should be safe and warm. The last thing he heard was Fin’s surprised curses as he followed their trail back to the camp.
