# 42 | Commitment [Sal]

Memories plagued him. He couldn't decide if they were torment or pleasure. Perhaps both, or neither. What they were was steadfast; he couldn't draw away from them.

Sal leaned against a jagged limestone wall, the stones of which were thin and stacked randomly within tight constraints. Just beyond was a smooth pillar upon which a steady lamp shed its light into the night. Also attached was a gate that appeared to have warred against the practicality of keeping people out and won by a fair margin; what was left was very pretty.

He would rather lean against the pillar, but that was off limits, too close to being seen. Djrek stood inside the shadow cast from the pillar and stared up at a bright streak of stars smeared across the sky. It would have been beautiful if it hadn't foretold yet another endless, blistering day. Sal glanced up, grimaced, then turned his gaze to glare at the dirt and the shiny black boots on them. In them reflected the stars, but for some reason Sal could only see the last.

He drew away with effort to find a distraction.

"Why are we skulking in the middle of the night?"

Djrek shot Sal an amused smile. "We are not skulk— where did you learn that word?"

Sal suppressed a smile. "Does it matter?"

"You frequently use words beyond your age. I find this fascinating."

Sal refused to answer, mostly because it involved a book he stole from one of the victims of Djrek's questioning sessions. It's not like they had any further use for it, but it was technically stealing and Sal didn't think it proper for an Inquisitor to be stealing books from the dead... not that it stopped him.

"Right well, we're waiting on Ash."

Sal looked up at Djrek, rolled his eyes, and returned his gaze to the ground. "And why are we waiting for her?"

"Because..." Djrek sighed and returned his to sky, "Royals are a slippery bunch. They take quite a bit more planning than the average citizen."

Sal suppressed a sigh. "What are you planning?"

Djrek laughed a delighted sound. "Oh, you will go far as an Inquisitor."

Huh? "I don’t think—"

"First," Djrek raised a fist and a finger, "we have several specialists blocking off all the exits we know of and several that we shouldn't."

"Specialists?"

"Second," another finger raised, "we have several rangers scattered throughout the forest in case we missed an exit. I must admit this is more common that it should be. Royals are—"

"—slippery?"

Djrek spared him a glance. "Yes... that. Well, either that or they're aggressive. I prefer aggressive."

"Why?"

"It requires less running, less pleading, and fewer offers of absurd amounts of money I have absolutely no use for."

"Money?" Sal exclaimed, followed by a pause, then, "...bribe an Inquisitor? That doesn't sound smart."

"Hmm," he nodded, "money is never a concern for us, though they never seem to realize that."

Sal's eyes perked up. "Why?" he said slowly.

"Let me ask a question."

Sal closed his eyes, realizing this had somehow turned into a teaching session.

Djrek chuckled a moment, then turned serious. "Why do you want to be an Inquisitor?"

"You're the one dragging me."

"Am I?" He raised an eyebrow. "What do you want then? You want money? I will give you enough money to buy a village. Or do you want to live in the city? Perhaps in Castel, among their twisting spires? I will arrange it. Or is that too low a vision? Perhaps you want to live in the cities, Rotaka, the seat of the Empire? Would you walk among the clouds as a Royal? But perhaps even that is not enough. Would you be a shaper with the kind of power few could rival? But let's not stop there. I can make you a General, a leader of men, the kind they write histories about. You have the potential; I can make it all happen."

Sal no longer leaned on the wall, but stood one foot half a step in front of the other. He watched Djrek with wide eyes and a pinched brow, stunned by what he was hearing. He'd spent weeks studying Djrek's expressions, his smiles, how he manipulated others. Yet in all that time he'd never seen Djrek lie, not even once.

"Walk away, Sal, and I will make come true dreams you never thought to imagine."

But he couldn't, not to be Royal, not to be a shaper, not even to be a General. Djrek offered him all the he had ever hoped for and more. Yet they slid through his mind like oil, refusing to take hold. He stared at the ground, seeing those dreams play out in the dark, watching them die.

Dreams, it seemed, could die easily, but not memories. Never those.

"But without purpose," Sal whispered.

"It would be but dust in your hand."

Sal looked up. Djrek had that knowing smile, the one that made Sal want to rearrange his face. But this time it was different; this time he understood.

"So let me ask you a question," Djrek shifted to a quiet intensity, "would you take any bribe?"

"No," Sal whispered.

"No, not for all the gold in the world."

Sal blinked slowly as warmth spread through his belly. He nodded. "Okay, so why are we waiting?"

Djrek laughed a low, hearty, delighted sound. "Ash is infiltrating the compound to locate our target; shouldn't be much longer."

"You mean Youlson?"

Djrek nodded. "And to be clear, Youlson is not a bad person. He provided extensively for Larstead and is regarded as one of the more generous Royals."

"So you'll offer him a deal?"

"No. He dies tonight."

Sal frowned. "If he's a good person, what's the difference between him and Mr. Gastrick?"

"Well, for one, Royals are not afforded the same leniency as we might citizens of the Empire or, as the Royals like to call them, peasants. Royals know _exactly_ what they're doing and what the risks are."

"But don't we encourage their power struggles?"

"We do," he nodded, "especially among themselves. But that only makes it more important we give them no ground whatsoever, especially as it concerns Elderin. Though this experiment of theirs concerns me even more."

"It goes deeper, though." Djrek looked back up at the stars. "The citizenry of the Empire _are_ the Empire. They form a fabric, a tapestry, if you will. People like Mr. Gastrick strengthen the fabric by virtue of being such a large part of their community. To remove someone like Mr. Gastrick would cause far too much of the tapestry to unravel."

Djrek turned his attention to the mansion behind Sal. "The Royals, in contrast, sit above that tapestry, managing it, using it their advantage. They are necessary, but only as a whole and only as a job. The chaos of their power mongering has rendered them replaceable. Where one falls, another is quick to step in and grab that power for themselves."

"Their greed made them... irrelevant?"

"And again with the words." Djrek looked at him for three seconds, then shook it off. "Yes. The people who truly matter cannot wage war, and the people who can are easily replaced. As good a man as Youlson may be, at least for a Royal, his body won't have cooled before another has taken his place, and quite eagerly, I might add."

"So our job is to keep everything stable."

Djrek looked at him and smiled. "Come, we have a Royal to visit."

He walked to the gate, tugged on the lapels of his jacked, then thrust out his hand. The gate blasted in toward the compound.

"And who keeps us in check?" Sal whispered as Djrek casually walked though the decimated gate into the compound.

Several windows lit up as Djrek calmly walked toward the "compound", which really stretched the term so far as Sal was concerned. It consisted of a single, three-story building that didn't warrant the expression no matter the size. It was a house, not a compound, or maybe a mansion.

A dozen men plus one flooded out of the now well-lit front door to surround the intruders. Five of them immediately sheathed their weapons and walked into the night upon seeing Djrek.

The remaining eight fanned out. One spat on the ground, mumbled some nonsense about cowards, and approached Djrek with a plain steel sword in hand. Sal would have laughed had he time, but in two moves Djrek had cut the sword in half and removed the head of the man with his knife. His knife was re-sheathed before the body hit the ground; he hadn't even slowed his pace.

Sal stared at the remains of the sword as he walked by. It had been cleanly sliced in two with no more resistance than the air itself. He'd seen Djrek dismember the foolish before but to cut a sword in half... that was another level entirely.

The remaining seven men took a step back, then another. They parted as Djrek approached and Sal made sure to stay right on the man's heels.

They walked through gilded doors into a two story, circular foyer. A pair of grand staircases wrapped around each side of the room to meet on a balcony stretched across the second floor. Beneath it were two oddly wide doors carved with twin ornate serpents, their heads hissing at each other. In front of the doors were two marble stands carefully positioned to keep the door from opening fully without blocking the view of the serpents. When the doors opened, those same heads would be aimed at whomever dared enter.

"That's..."

"Yes," Djrek nodded as he slowed to a stop, "very inventive."

Djrek waited for twenty seconds before his patience gave out. "It would be a shame if I had to destroy such artwork," he said loudly.

Six seconds passed before he raised his hand. Sal took a step back but paused when he saw shadows under the door. Djrek lowered his hand and waited as two servants opened the doors just shy of the marble stands. As they did, the serpents revealed themselves as a full three dimensional carving. Sal stared into an intricately detailed mouth.

"Wow."

"Yes, I rather want to meet this artist." Djrek stepped up and traced a polished fang with his finger. "It is truly exceptional work."

As Djrek continued to admire the piece, the shuffle of feet and muffled voices spilled out from the room beyond. Twenty-three seconds later, the sounds died down.

Djrek looked back at Sal. "Do you think they've had enough time to prepare?"

"I... don't think that's possible."

"True," Djrek conceded with a nod, "but if they feel prepared, perhaps they won't run." Djrek closed his eyes and sighed. "I really hope they don't run. It's always so tedious."

The interior room extended the full three stories, braced by marbled columns that held up the supports to a massive stained glass ceiling. The room was empty, encased in white marble. Sal had to resist the urge to run around, turn out all the lights, and wait for Ionia, if only to see how the fractured light would play on the columns.

Toward the end of the room was a double-layered dais that held nothing, though Sal couldn't help but imagine a throne sitting center. There were second and third floor balconies with two white-painted doors on each side. The third floor balcony was empty, but the second floor held six casters, three each side and spaced evenly; their aim tracked the pair as they walked. A dozen guards lined each side of the first floor behind the pillars. It almost felt like an ambush, but that would be absurd.

A white man walked in from a door on the right. He was lean, tall, with straight brown hair and hollow eyes. He was distracted and still latching up an expensive doublet, a wooden sword tucked under arm, and one polished boot incorrectly tied. He had attached his sword to a mount on his waist and had one foot already on the dais when he raised his eyes.

He jerked back when he saw Djrek; his skin drained to a deathly pale. Sal was certain he would run or perhaps pass out— the man had stopped breathing. It took him seven seconds to shake off his fear with a deep trembling breath and walk up the dais.

Djrek gave him a polite, interested smile. Nothing dangerous. "I must ask," he said, "who is your decorator?"

The man, Youlson presumably, blinked hard. "I... ah, my decorator?"

"Yes! The door, the stain glass, the design— really the whole arrangement is quite astonishing."

Youlson pinched the bridge of his nose with one hand; the other rested lightly on his sword. "You came here, in the middle of the night, for my decorator?"

"No, of course not, but I absolutely love the austere use of space combined with the stain glass. Art like this is truly hard to find."

Austere. Sal mouthed the word, vaguely recalling the term from a book. Austere. Empty? Sal looked around confused until he realized the room was oddly bare. He'd thought it was intentional but a second glance revealed the faint outlines of displaced dust.

"Ah well, I just bought—" Youlson looked up suddenly, "would you be willing to forget your reason for coming if I gave you this decorator?"

Djrek barked out a laugh. "Are you trying to bribe an Inquisitor with a decorator?"

"No no, of course not," Youlson shook his head but spoke quietly, eyes intense, "not unless it works."

"It's certainly the most unique bribe I've been offered, but it does occur to me that all this—" he gestured with a broad motion that caused the casters to jerk "—is quite the expenditure for a minor royal."

Youlson's face grew guarded. "I've been fortunate with my business."

His eyes casually flittered to Sal, back to Djrek, and then latched back on Sal. His head followed, his eyes narrowed, then widened suddenly.

"We treat them well," he said, eyes never leaving Sal.

"You did."

"That must count for something."

"It does."

"I'm a good person; I treat people well. Ask my servants, they'll tell you."

"I have no doubt they would."

"I can make it up. I promise, I'll make it up."

"I have no doubt you'd try."

Youlson turned pleading eyes on Djrek. "What do I need to do? Anything, ask it, it's yours. I'll give all my wealth; I'll renounce myself as a Royal, I'll... I'll..."

"You knew the risks, and the risks now call their due."

Youlson's face twisted in struggle and indecision. He raised an arm in sudden defiance, but his eyes darted between his guards and casters. He looked at them and his eyes softened with despair. He wouldn't sacrifice his men for this; he would bare the cost himself. A sharp pang of admiration and pity rose in Sal. Youlson dropped his shoulders and his arm followed.

The casters couldn't tell the difference between defeat and a call to attack.

Djrek's arm jerked out in time for several bolts to deflect from an invisible shield around Sal and him.

Youlson's eyes widened in horror.

Then Djrek was simply gone.

A strangled, gurgling noise drew their attention to the balcony on their right. The nearest caster was clutching her throat and Djrek, little more than a black blur, was racing toward the second one.

With Youlson distracted, Sal casually walked up the dais. It took a hair over two seconds, but at the end Djrek was finished and Sal's knife was at Youlson's throat.

"Don't," Sal said as Youlson reached for his sword.

Youlson's hand hovered above the pommel. His eyes alone strained to look at Sal, the rest of his body rigid.

"What are you, nine? Do you really have what it takes to kill a man? Do you know what that does to a person?"

"Are you in the habit of insulting the person with a knife to your throat?"

Youlson chuckled bitterly, "I'm not normally threatened so by a child."

Sal pressed the knife into his throat until it drew blood. "Let it go." His voice remained calm, steady, without the slightest quiver.

Youlson ground his teeth, lip curled, but he released the mount and the sword dropped to the ground. Sal kicked it off the dais.

All the casters were dead, three by Djrek and three by Ash, who occupied the opposite balcony alone. Two guards had managed to draw their swords but the rest had stopped to watch their Royal unmanned by what appeared to be a child.

"Djrek?" Sal said, his voice calm, his hand steady.

"Just a minute."

Djrek vaulted over the balcony and landed with a casual grace that should not have been possible. He walked down the hall and appeared all but oblivious to at least a dozen very confused looking guards, only half of which now had weapons out but showed no interest in using them. The rest looked ill.

"I didn't mean for them..." Youlson closed his eyes and for a moment Sal felt pity for the man.

"I know," Djrek said as he placed himself in the exact place he started, "and I know this all wasn't your idea. You just got caught up in politics and greed like any good Royal. What I don't know is who stands behind you to pull these strings wrapped around your throat."

"I cannot say." Youlson seemed to shrink on himself. Sal's knife dug deeper and forced Youlson to flinch back upright.

"But you know."

"There are those I fear even more than you, Inquisitor."

"More than death itself, it seems. You might save a lot of lives."

"I... don't believe it would."

Djrek watched Youlson for eight seconds, a small sad smile on his face. He gave Sal a single nod.

"No wai—"

Sal drew the blade and stepped back as Youlson gripped his throat, shock in his eyes. Sal walked around to stand before the him as he fell to his knees, the blood gushing from between his fingers.

"I'm sorry you were replaceable," Sal said as Youlson struggled to keep life within his veins.

It took six seconds for Youlson to loose his strength and fall to his knees, dragging him down below Sal's eye level. He opened his mouth as though to speak, but only blood came out. Sal kept his eyes locked to Youlson's, watching the man's dreams and potential flow out from between his fingers. His eyes flashed anger, frustration, despair; and then they glazed and it all faded away while the body collapsed to the floor.

"I stand corrected," Ash said from behind.

Sal turned to see her walk up beside Djrek.

"You really should learn to read people." Djrek hadn't removed his eyes from Sal. In them Sal saw something he'd never seen before, something that burned and burrowed deep into his soul; it was something he'd never had, never realized he needed. In that moment he saw pride in Djrek's.

Ash harrumphed. "I'll stick to research."

"Did you notice what he said?" Djrek said, still looking at Sal.

"We treat them well."

Djrek threw his head back and laughed. He turned to Ash. "See?"

Ash rolled her eyes and waved her hand. "Yes, yes, he's like a little Djrek. Can we go now?"

"There are more," Sal said.

Ash turned to him and cocked her head.

"He knew Larstead was gone but they still "treat" them well." Sal shook his head. "There must be more towns like mine."

Ash closed her eyes and breathed out, "Fuck."

Djrek nodded. "And that was our last lead."

"Couldn't we have made him talk?"

"No," Djrek placed both hands on Sal's shoulders and looked him in the eye. "Never go down that path; it is forbidden and will lead you astray." He released Sal and straitened. "Besides, a man in pain will say anything. Their words cannot be trusted."

"Then what now?"

"Now, we travel." Djrek's smile broadened. "You have an Emperor to meet."

Djrek turned on his heel and began walking out while Sal processed his words. Ash spared Sal a pitying glance before she too turned to go.

Six seconds later, Sal's mouth caught up to his head.

"Wait—"

"Come on, Sal, don't dawdle." Djrek said over his shoulder.

Sal shook off his stupor and jogged past what was left of the guards to catch Djrek.
