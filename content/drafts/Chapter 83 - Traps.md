# 83 | Traps

At their early return, several in the camp rushed to meet them with concern on their faces. Alistar headed them all off and approached Jonah first.

“News?”

“We may have found what’s been hunting us.”

He grunted. “You mean other than the whole damn forest?”

Jonah forced out a chuckle. “Yes, that, but we’ve found tracks of an apex predator. Roland here believes it’s been hunting us, picking off our scouting parties.”

“A single animal?”

Jonah nodded in reply, to which Alister shook his head. “Gods forsaken forest... plans?”

“Traps.”

“We’ve got nothing in our stocks for anything like that.”

“We’ll make them ourselves, with Roland’s help, of course.”

Alistar looked Roland over skeptically but shrugged. “I’ll trust your judgment then.”

He turned with a frown and headed back into camp. Jonah waved off the others, but Roland forestalled him.

“I think Stan would be of some help. These traps will need to be very... robust.”

Stan looked confused but nodded. “It’ll be nice to be helpful for a change.”

“Snowplowing beneath you now?” Fin said and turned to head into the camp without waiting for a response.

Stan flashed a smile. “At least I’m useful.”

Fin made a rude gesture behind his back, to which Stan frowned and turned to Jonah. “He’s off.”

Jonah nodded. “It’s all getting to him, I think.” He turned back to Roland. “What do we need?”

“Rope, strong, ah very strong. Actually, we may need to braid whatever you have. And we’ll need a strong, flexible sapling... a Whitewood .”

“You want to cut down a White? A logger would be better — no offense, Stan — and even then, it might take a while.”

“That’s what they’re here for,” Stan said with a shrug.

“We’ll need someone to bend the sapling.”

“You want to _bend_ a White? Is that even possible?”

“It’s still a sapling. It’ll bend and break like any other... just requires a bit more force.”

“Only a bit, huh?” Jonah turned to Stan, who had an intrigued look on his face.

“Worth a try.”

“Okay, then.” Jonah turned to Anna, who’d been watching the exchange with interest. “We should have some rope in the stores. Can you find... ah, how much do we need?”

“Maybe twenty paces, braided.”

Anna nodded and headed off without sparing a glance at Roland, who watched her walk away in confusion. Dammit, but he did not understand what was going on. He barely understood his own emotions, which was made worse when she oscilated like that.

He heard a chuckle and turned to see Stan watching him with amusement.

“Oh, I don’t miss that.”

“Miss what?”

“This phase of the mating ritual.”

“The... wait, what?!”

“Step one in seducing the males of our species has always been to confuse the hell out of them.” He shook his head and turned to follow Jonah.

Did he say seducing? Roland stared at him in shock as the subject matter he’d been dancing around was suddenly thrust at him. He swallowed hard and jogged to catch up with Stan. “What’s step two, then?”

“Hell if I know. I’ve always been too confused to figure it out.”

“Is that what happened with your girl?”

“_My_ girl?” Stan harumped. “More like I was _her_ boy. Half the time, I didn’t know which direction was up when she was around. I thought we were in love, but now I’m here and she’s...” He waved off in a dismissive hand.

“You loved her?”

“I still love her, can’t seem to stop. Even now, here in the most dangerous forest in the world, I can’t say I’d have done anything differently. It’s so... just so damn frustrating sometimes.” He ran his hands through his hair and pulled hard at the ends before letting it go with a sigh. “Here’s what advice I can give you. Don’t try to figure it — her — out. Just go with it. If you like each other, let the cards fall. Maybe it works out, maybe not, but at least you tried... at least you got to experience it.”

“You think she likes me?”

“She ah... well, I think she acts strangely around you. I’m sorry, Roland, but that’s all I got. Maybe, if I knew women better I could help, but then I’d probably not be out here in the first place. At least you don’t have to worry about pissing off a Royal.”

----

It took them about an hour to find a suitable sapling. By then, Anna had dominated all of Roland’s thoughts. Yet despite circling around the issue repeatedly, he was no closer to understanding than he’d been an hour ago. He repeatedly tried to push her out of his mind only to find himself unwittingly dwelling on her just a few minutes later.

So many years of training only to be brought down by a girl.

The sapling extended almost a dozen paces high with small white branches leading out to large, maple-like leaves colored the deep, blood-red color they had during winter.

Roland walked up to the tree and removed his sword.

“Perhaps we should see if I can bend the White before we cut it down?”

“Oh, right.”

He took a few steps back and gave Stan an expectant look. He was intensely curious as to what Stan could do. He wasn’t even sure Rose could bend a sapling like this.

Stan looked away from Roland to the sapling with a studied expression. His lips pressed together, but a smile tugged at the ends, suggesting he was enjoying the challenge. He turned back to the tree and looked at it for a minute in thought. Finally, having settled on a strategy, he began.

Roland sensed the shape as little more than a curved surface, almost half a ring, and barely a finger in height. It was exactly what was required for the task and nothing more. More importantly, it was possibly the most distinct shape he’d ever sensed. Even Rose’s shapes often would blur a little at the edges, and as far as he knew, there was only so much that could be done about it. Practice and experience were the best remedies, and Rose had those in excess.

Yet what he sensed from Stan almost felt real, like he was sensing an object and not a manipulated surface. Roland could cut his mind on such a surface. He then decided that he didn’t want Stan to see any of his own surfaces, which were child-like scribbles compared to this, no matter how strong he could make them.

At first, nothing happened to the tree except a very slight sway, almost imperceptible. Stan grunted and shook his head. Then to Roland’s surprise, he sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes.

Roland was so curious about Stan’s behavior he’d forgotten to look at the tree itself. A creaking sound drew his attention back to it, and he was surprised to see it bending almost a full quarter. Over the next couple of minutes, the tree continued to bend until the tip bowed about half its height, where it finally stalled. Stan’s face betrayed no sense of effort except for rivulets of sweat that trickled down his face. He continued to strain for another minute or so, but the tree made no further progress.

Stan released the tree with a gasp. It snapped with a loud crack that sounded through the forest before rebounding off nearby mountain ridges and returning with a low rumble that sounded oddly like thunder.

“I didn’t even think that was possible,” Jonah said in a breathless voice as he stared at Stan in wonder.

Stan stood up and tried to hide his smile. “I’ve always been strong,” he said modestly as he brushed the snow off his clothes.

Roland had to agree. He was certainly stronger than Rose at the very least, rarified air indeed.

He once again removed his sword and approached the tree.

“Oh no, you’re not getting off that easy.”

Roland turned back to Stan, who had provocation on his face and fire in his eyes. Roland blanched. He hadn’t expected this to turn into a challenge.

“We proved you could bend it, right?” He knew what the man wanted but held some hope he could get out of it.

Stan waved at the tree, but his eyes never left Roland as his smile broadened. “Let’s see what you can do, forest-boy.”

Roland sighed, turned to the tree, and stared for a moment as he tried to figure out how not to reveal too much. Maybe he could convince them he wasn’t good enough.

“So, I don’t actually know how to shape the way you do.”

“Can you shift or rotate, at least?”

“Well, yeah.”

Stan smirked. “Then you have what you need, don’t you?”

Roland turned back to the sapling. “Well...”

“Come one, forest-boy. Let’s see what you can do.”

Something about Stan’s eyes, and perhaps his tone, flared a spark in Roland. It was unfamiliar, unexpected, and he unwittingly found a smile tugging at his face. A competition made, a challenge issued, a contest of wit and power... it was naught, but an invitation to comaderie and Roland was helpless against its pull. Stan wanted to see what he could do, he would _show_ him what he could do.

He immediately sensed out every Whitewood in the area and anchored to them, though he kept no tension on them. He used the sense of them to feel out the best location to manage an equilibrium, walked over, and, taking inspiration from Stan, he sat down cross-legged. He flashed Stan wry smile and closed his eyes.

He _pulled_.

At first, he _pulled_ against both the sapling before him and the root system of a Whitewood behind him. It took only a few moments before the sapling’s crown was less than a finger’s width from his brow.

It was not enough. He’d barely any exerted effort at all, and for once, he felt driven to do something more than necessary.

So he _pulled_ again, and this time he included every Whitewood he’d anchored to. Immediately, the disparate tensions forced him to make a hundred adjustments to keep himself in place. It was a weird sensation to take the intuition he’d spent years developing to keep himself stable within the treetops and use that instead to bend those same trees to his will.

Distantly he became aware that the forest had become loud. Creaks and groans cried out in the voice of the unbent forced to kneel. He’d never pulled like this before, forced himself on the forest quite in this way. It felt familiar in a way that crept unease into the darker parts of his soul.

He opened his eyes to flash a triumphat smile at Stan and froze.

A dozen realities crashed into his mind.

Foremost was the forest itself. Every Whitewood within sight, and many more beyond had bent themselves over to bow to Roland. Within this sea of obeisance, Stan stood there, his face a mix of horror, wonder, and inexplicable curiosity. Jonah’s reflected only fear.

Roland released the Whitewoods of their obligation and let his feet down to the ground. Only then did he realize he’d lifted himself several feet into the air. He shifted, one foot to another, back and forth, while his face struggled against the horror of what he’d just done. In a moment of sheer adolescent hubris, he’d practically revealed everything he was and in doing so, managed to destroy the very thing he needed most in the world.

“What are you?” The words had been barely whispered by Jonah, as though he’d tempted fate with their utterance. But it was his eyes that burned Roland, for in them he saw in himself little more than a beast of the forest.

“An innate trait.” Stan spoke suddenly into the unnatural silence of the forest.

“A what?” Jonah looked started, either by the statement itself or Stan’s audacity to speak at all.

“It’s a... an inherent ability to do certain things without thinking about them. Some believe they’re passed between generations and, while traits do seem to follow bloodlines, it has never been proven reliably, though the very rarity of it might obscure such conclusions. Regardless, if you have an innate trait, you just _do_ them, like you were born to it, and likely without any concrete idea of how. It can be infuriating to those without the trait.”

Stan’s voice sounded singular within the silence, carried out with what had to be a practiced and even cadence. His tone was so matter-of-fact that he might as well have been in a lecture hall. Roland had never witnessed a sacred silence assaulted so assiduously.

“I didn’t know that was even a thing.” Jonah said in surprise, eyebrows raised. And with that, the spell broke. Some of the prior tension fled his shoulders as something approaching the rational asserted itself in his mind.

“It’s very rare... although, you might be surprised just how many at the college have one.”

Something clicked in Roland’s mind, and he spoke without thinking. “Your shaping, it’s innate?”

Stan looked to Roland, and a moment passed between them. Then his lips twitched up at the corners, and he nodded. In that nod, Roland once again found acceptance and with it salvation. He didn’t know whether Stan knew what he was or the extent of what he could do, but what he saw in that face was that it didn’t matter. Stan had accepted him, embraced him, or perhaps even forgiven him.

“I’ve always been able to shape ever since I was a kid, but I learned quickly to keep it hidden.” He shot Roland a knowing look. “Yet even that didn’t save me from the inquisitors.”

“Inquisitors?”

Stan’s had tilted back slightly as his face registered some suspicion confirmed.

“A task force the Empire uses to find godlings, as though those exist anymore.” Jonah sounded as though he was trying to convince himself of some long-standing prejudice now under assault.

Stan nodded affably, and again it had the flavor of a teacher’s approval. “If they believe you’re a godling, they’ll kill you on the spot, no questions asked. If your parents try to hide you, they’ll won’t even test you. They’ll simply _assume_ you are and kill the whole family.”

Jonah shifted his attention fully to Stan for the first time. “You had a run-in with them?”

“It was not pleasant. I mean, they were nice enough, I suppose but just the idea that they held my life on their whim... once they realized I was only exhibiting an innate trait to shape, though, my whole world changed. I was fast-tracked to the shaper’s school.” He turned to Roland. “So, what exactly can you do?”

Roland tried to shrug as naturally as possible. “I can pull on anything that’s gravic.”

“Pull... hmmm okay, and does it just apply to you as well or only to the object?”

“Both.”

Stan’s face maintaining thoughtful countenance as he looked at Roland. “Multiple objects at once, I assume.”

It didn’t sound like a question, but he answered anyway. “Yes.”

“Can you push?”

“What?” Roland’s eyebrows pushed up, and he blinked hard at Stan.

“Push... can you push instead of pull?”

Roland stared at him in stunned silence. “I ah... I, I don’t know...” How had this never occurred to him?

Stan gave him an expectant look while Roland processed the implications. Had he really only been using _half_ of his ability all these years? It seemed impossible, and yet, well, he’d never tried. It seemed impossible that he could miss something so elemental and yet...

He stared turned and stared at the sampling. Stan had been correct in that his trait came naturally, almost without thought, perhaps even better without thought. While he’d spent countless hours learning to use his trait, he’d barely given thought to how it actually occurred, much less how to do its opposite. The possibilities, though, were tantalizing, so he anchored himself to the sapling and _pushed_.

Nothing happened.

He almost felt relief, though it was stained with dissappointment. He’d already been dreaming up all the ways that _pushing_ might help him in the hunt. Scenes of pinning his prey down in place or even crushing them spun through his head. He looked up at Stan and shook his head.

“Okay, but maybe try more than once? If you’ve been pulling this whole time, then pushing might feel weird, like an ill-used muscle.”  Stan’s voice carried just enough of a patronizing tone that he felt his pride bristle.

Roland pursed his lips but closed his eyes and decided to try again, if only to prove the man wrong. A small voice told him that was probably the whole point of the tone, but he ignored it. Instead of just trying to push, he established his anchors and _pulled_ slightly, paying close attention to the sensation itself.

It was surprisingly difficult to analyze himself in this way, like trying to analyze his own walk, whereby the very act of observing suddenly made every act wooden and forced. This was further complicated in that he was essentially studying himself as he walked forward to learn how to do it backward, preferably without falling on his ass.

The analogy was suprisingly apt. He repeatedly tried to reverse his _pull_ into a _push_, but all he ever achieved was the mental equivalent of falling over. After several attempts and the beginnings of a headache, he forced himself to take a mental step back.

One didn’t walk backward by using the inversion of forward movements. There were too many other things to consider, from the very tilt of the body and its center-balance, to the inertia of motion itself and how it interacts with the mechanics of the body. Trying to take forward motion and reverse it exactly was a fool’s mission.

It was also quite possible he was overthinking this. One didn’t work out the mechanics to walk backward. As awkward as it might be, the body knew how to do the motion. The awkwardness simply had to be accepted as part of the process.

He took a deep breath and _pushed_.

Nothing.

He released his breath and _pushed_.

Nothing.

He breathed in again and _pushed_.

Nothing.

He released his breath through his nose and _pushed_.

Noth—

“If we’re done making unbendable trees sway, perhaps we could get along with the business at hand?” Jonah said in a wry tone.

Roland opened his eyes and startled to see the sapling bending away from him. He re-examined his senses to realize that something was different about the way his energy flowed, he simply hadn’t identified the sensation as a push.

Stan had a deeply amused smile and oddly proud expression on his face.

Roland’s mind spun with ideas. Pushing could change everything. It opened up a whole new realm of tactics he was eager to try out. He distractedly walked over to the tree, removed his sword, and formed a cleaving edge who’s surface formed far from the gravwood and tapered slowly. He swiped at the base of the tree, making sure that the cut was made at an angle. The cut was clean, and the tree toppled over. He looked over at it, amused as the branches of the tree speared into the snow with no bend at all. Whitewoods were odd trees.

He walked over to begin trimming the branches off when he realized that the other two had gone oddly silent. He looked over to see Jonah with an irritated look on his face while Stan had his lips pursed in amusement.

“That’s odd,” Stan said.

Jonah nodded, his own head cocked to the side.

“What’s odd?”

“Gravtech isn—”

“Well, just that I wouldn’t have expected a sword to be able to do that.” Jonah interrupted with a sharp shake of the head.

Roland looked them curiously. “I just created a cleaving edge on it.”

Jonah turned to Stan. “Isn’t that what axes are for?”

Stan nodded with a troubled look on his face. He motioned for him to hand the sword over, which Roland only did after a reluctant moment of possessiveness. Stan carefully looked it over, turning it around several times to view it at every angle.

“I’ve never seen a design like this before. It... doesn’t seem possible.”

He yelped and dropped it to the ground.

Jonah looked at him with a raised brow. “Care to explain?”

“It _bit_ me.”

Roland chuckled as he picked the weapon back up. “It’s just feeding you back your energy.”

“It what?”

Roland gave him a consternated look and shrugged. “That’s normal, right?”

“No... no. That’s not how gravtech works. You feed it energy, and it responds. It might be hard to get it to respond properly, but it sure as hell doesn’t just hand you back your own energy. That... that makes no sense.”

“Sure it—”

“Can we shelve this?” Jonah looked irritated. “We have a lot to get done today and as interesting as all this—” he waved his hand off to the side, “—discussion is, we have a dangerous predator to capture.”

Roland stared at him a moment and then glanced over at the tree. What he had in mind wouldn’t capture something like a Sabre for very long. He doubted it would remain trapped for more than a minute or so if he were lucky. No, the trap was a signal. It would tell him _where_ the creature was so he could track and kill it.

Perhaps he shouldn’t mention that part.

He shrugged, walked over to the tree, and continued to shear off limbs. Stan looked very much like he’d eaten something bad, but he watched Roland intently, occasionally shaking his head while mumbling to himself.

Roland had almost finished when he startled, his eyes catching the barest glimpses of a white blur in his periphery. His head snapped to the side and locked his eyes on the place he’d seen it. It was almost imperceptible, and he was tempted to think his mind made it up, but he was not so foolish as to discard it. No, his friend was back, but for what reason, he could not discern.

“What’s wrong?”

Roland looked up at Jonah, who watched him with a steady, concerned gaze. Roland held that gaze for a moment before his eyes flicked back out to the woods in a practiced scan that exposed itself under the force of habit.

“We’re too loud,” he said quietly as he searched again for the elusive creature, only to be rebuffed by the thing’s apparent ease of hiding. It was unnatural for something that large to hide so well.

“_We’re_ too loud?” Jonah had contorted his face into incredulity.

Roland winced at the implication. “Sorry. I’ve been too loud.”

“I don’t see anything,” Stan said, his own eyes scanning the forest.

Jonah looked only slightly mollified as he too turned to the forest.

“You wouldn’t.”

The both turned to him with something like amusement on their face, though laced with unease.

“Oh? Is it small?”

Roland blinked at Stan and slowly shook his head. “No.”

He had an intuitive feel of being hunted, a very unique and unsettling taste. Yet there was nothing he could do. It would remain hidden so long as it desired, and given the thoroughly queasy look they both had on their faces, he’d already said too much. So, he returned his attention to the sapling with a mind now hypersensitive to everything around him.

A few silent minutes later and he had the sapling stripped. Jonah picked up the severed branches and carefully bundled them together. Most of the branches were singular things with no futher stems, and even those together were heavy enough that it forced him to shoulder the bundle.

Roland was quietly coming up a plan for the sapling, which was too heavy to carry, when Stan motioned him aside. After a moment, the sapling rose into the air.

Stan shrugged at his surprised look. “Good practice.”

The three of them set back toward the camp, Jonah grunting quietly under his load of twigs and Stan walking calmly beside the long trunk of the sapling floating chest level beside him. Roland walked beside Stan, feeling odd without anything to carry, though he kept his eyes sharp for any more flickers of white motion.

“I remember that feeling,” Stan said after some time. Though quiet, his voice seemed to violate some sacred accord agreed upon by the three of them, though Jonah was too far ahead to hear it. No matter that he was probably sweating now, the man seemed driven in some fundamental way that Roland didn’t understand.

It took Roland a full minute to realize Stand was waiting for a response of some sort. “What feeling?” Although he wasn’t sure he wanted to have this conversation.

“There were several days when I knew the inquisitors were coming. Our town was large, and my parents connected enough that they found out a full five days before they were to arrive. I wasn’t meant to know, but I’ve always had a way of finding myself in the wrong places.”

This was definitely a conversation Roland didn’t want to have.

“They considered — only briefly— of running, but running from an inquisitor was as assured of a death as one can get. It was pointless to worry me. Pointless for me to know that my life would soon be judged.”

“I’m sorry, that sounds—”

“I spent _five days_ terrified I might accidentally destroy everything I love. _Five days_ I spent thinking of how I might end myself before they did it for me, before _I_ killed my own family.”

Roland’s mouth had snapped shut, hands clenched, eyes cast forward and down to follow Jonah’s footprints. His breath had become raggad, though he tried hard to keep it contained through his nose.

“A part of me that relished the prospect of having that much power, and another part that cowered in a dark corner of my soul. Yet when it came time to judge me, they found me as nothing more than a gifted prodigy with a variant trait, and one highly coveted.” He barked out a severe laugh. “I was disappointed and relieved and so, terribly confused. I had expected to die but instead found myself given the best opportunity I could have ever hoped for.”

He stopped and immediately reached forward to grab Roland. The touch made him flinch, but he allowed himself to be brought about, his eyes kept glued to the ground. His mind was a tumultuous sea of old, buried memories of his parents and forbidden emotions he’d long since imprisoned.

“Even now, with all this,” he gestured around with his free hand, “_those_ were the worst days of my life. I’ve never felt more terror than did at myself during those five days.”

He dropped Roland’s hand, who took an instinctive step back. Roland couldn’t bring himself to unclench his jaw or hand or even look up.

“Barely a day goes by when I don’t think about it, wonder what would have become of me, assuming, of course, that I got away or something. Yet for all the terror I felt, most of that faded to leave one impression I’ve never gotten rid of, never been able to shake. It clings to me like my own shadow at times.”

Roland had anchored himself to a dozen trees and was moments from fleeing. Most of him didn’t want to abandon them, his only chance for friendship, yet he couldn’t stand under the assault of Stan’s words. They hit too close, drug up too much, threatened too many of the walls he’d erected to maintain his sanity.

“Alone.”

Roland looked up.

“I felt terribly alone and isolated.”

Stan’s words had become a knife to pierce his soul. He inadvertently dropped all his anchors and almost fell to his knees before he stopped them from buckling. His body trembled visibly, and no matter how he tried, he couldn’t keep tears from escaping.

“So I have to ask you. Can we be friends?”

Roland didn’t trust his voice but managed a single nod.
