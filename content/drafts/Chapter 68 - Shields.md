# 68 | Shields

He stood the center of the clearing, eyes forward, obedient and listless. This time of the day was supposed to be gravic training, but she’d instructed him to wait for her, and the longer he stood there, the more he panicked.

It was supposed to be gravic training. It had been that way for years, and he’d come to depend on it. Mornings were for the beatings thinly disguised as training. And these he could take because the rest of the day was not that. He just had to get through it.

Yet here he stood, as though it were morning, waiting for the day’s beating he’d already had.

His mind waffled between misguided attempts to imagine what would happen and even more futile attempts to understand what he’d done wrong. There was only one truly unforgivable offense, but he hadn’t shown his emotions in ages, always pushing them down until little more than a distant roar on the horizon.

No, he hadn’t lost it in a long time.

The worst was when he lost his temper. It was the only time her training had become beatings in truth. She’d broken bone more than once for his anger.

No, he’d not lost his temper recently, and not today. It couldn’t be that. There was no flaw in his face, the facade he put forth. It was impossible for her to see him. He was hidden, small, behind an impenetrable facade of stoic calm.

And yet, had she seen?

He put such effort to hide everything, to keep it all contained. Yet deep down, there was a monster, eager to escape, eager to take control. She couldn’t see it, though, that monster. She couldn’t understand, couldn’t know the lure of it, the need for him to let go and lose himself. She didn’t understand that it ate away at him, consuming him, becoming him. She couldn’t know that. That wasn’t what this was for.

But then what? And why? Why was he standing here, as though it were morning, watching the sun descend into the late afternoon? This time should be for gravic training. He should be frustrated with impossible toys, not waiting for her to come. He should be sitting, not standing. He should be losing himself in a puzzle.

A tear broke free. Somehow it slipped his control, betrayed his facade, revealed what must be hidden at all costs.

His breath quickened as he felt it start a journey down his face, and he quickly swiped it clean lest it betray his guilt.

He would not panic. Push it down, keep it contained. Maintain control, maintain the facade. She can’t see inside, she’ll never see his secrets. They were his alone. His alone, guarded and safe.

Deep breath. Hold until it burns. Release slowly. Slow the breath, slow the heart. Kill the panic, kill the emotions.

She walked out calmly wearing her blacks and reds, blood and death. His eyes tracked her closely as she walked over to one of the weapon chests. He struggled to keep his breath even as she rummaged around for whatever implement she’d conceived of for the afternoon. An eternity passed as he watched her retrieve it.

Her back hid the weapon, but whatever it was, he didn’t think it was a practice sword. He felt relief undermined by the terror of the unknown. Maybe not a sword, but a weapon nonetheless.

He corrected himself as she turned. Not weapon, _weapons_, a brace of knives. Knives were new. She’d taught him several weapons by now, but not knives.

The knives were made of wood, not sharp, and the color suggested gravwood. His mind flashed with images of throwing those knives at each other, but he couldn’t decide whether that was better or worse than their normal training.

He’d need his own brace if they were to train.

“No.”

He froze. He’d barely taken a step, but her command caught him short. He carefully set his foot down and turned back to her. He tried to keep his face clear, clean, empty, formless, dispassionate.

“This is not weapons training.”

His eyes betrayed him as they flicked to the knives in her hand. It certainly looked like weapons training, but appearances were deceiving.

She taught him that. Not lies, never lies, just assumptions. The wrong assumptions led him astray, and his own thoughts betrayed him. But not her. She never lied. She simply allowed him to believe in lies. That was the problem with expectations, they betrayed him. Always betraying him.

“Push and pull. These basic tenants define gravics—”

And angles, harmonics, waves, frequencies, and not least all the insane math she’d shoved down his throat for years. But sure, push and pull, a simplistic reduction. His eyes darted back to the knives as she continued to talk.

His jaw clenched until his teeth hurt. A lecture. She lectured, stating things he already knew. These were things in the wrong place, invading the order he’d come to rely on.

“—combine them together until the harmonics of each direction align. When that happens, the forces solidify into a surface.”

What he couldn’t understand was why the lecture. It wasn’t the time for lectures, especially ones that repeated basics he already knew. It wasn’t the time for knives either, yet for some reason, both were present.

“Solidify these forces, and you can defend against most attacks.”

His eyes snapped to her knives again as he braced himself against the realization assaulting him. She wasn’t lecturing him, she was giving him instructions to defend himself.

His throat dried out.

He was weaponless, bare, naked, defenseless. She was teaching him how to defend against the impossible. But what she asked was impossible. It always was, always and forever beyond his reach.

“Stand there.”

She pointed to the far end of the clearing. He hesitated a moment, but to delay was useless and dangerous besides. He slowly walked over, obedient and hateful, while his mind churned in frantic thought as he sought for some way he could form a shield in the next several seconds, something he’d never done before and should take most people years to accomplish, even for the most talented of them.

But of course, he wasn’t most people. He was the monster.

He knew what she was doing, but of course, he did. She was training him, using whatever method she deemed would yield the best results. Pain, stress, pressure. These things yielded results. He knew this because it was how she trained. And now he had seconds to form a shield against her knives.

The impossible, always the impossible. And somehow, he must overcome. Oh, but not yet. Not before the pain. Never that. Only impossible until the pain is too much and then, only then, was it possible. It was how it worked, after all. You must be broken to break, melted into sharpness, pruned to perfection, but always in pain.

He turned even as the first knife clipped his shoulder. The pain was dull and formless, ambiguous. His shoulder hurt, but that was easily ignored. He’d long since learned to ignore pain. It was the easiest thing to do until it wasn’t.

The next knife he dodged, shifting his weight only just enough that it missed his torso by a breath. The motion was instinctive, born from years of training, but her face had shifted in response. It was slight, just the barest tightening of her eyes, and so the subtle screamed danger at him. It had been the wrong thing to do.

“Dodge again, and I will make sure the next one doesn’t miss.”

He was trapped. His mind spiraled into despair, tasted its waters, then fled back into himself as though snapped by a whip. Despair should ever only be tasted, lest its gravity consume the mind whole.

There was a trick to accepting pain. To not flinch or dodge, to not raise hands in defense. There was a trick to tricking instinct. It was simple, really. He simply needed to shift his perspective. He needed to understand that moving was the same as not moving, that flinching was worse than stillness, dodging more painful than accepting.

So he embraced the truth that he would be hit and that he would feel pain, and it would be the best reality, if only to focus on the task at hand.

Push and pull. Harmonics. Energy exists as a wave that pushes into a hundred dimensions, an infinite variety on an unfathomable scale of subtleties.

Push and pull, but the harmonics were different between them. The body itself somehow dictated what harmonics would be, and because of that, controllable. Match the harmonics and make them sing together. Take the opposites and teach them to dance, to love, to embrace.

He grunted as a knife struck his chest, but less of an emotional reaction than simply the air being forced out of his lungs. His instinct was to double over, to gasp at the pain, to turn away and protect. But those things were the same, worse even, than standing still, so still he remained.

How to make love from opposites? Align their harmonics. Make the push dance with the pull.

He _pulled_ on nothing. It felt weird, alien. Always he’d _pulled_ on something, the Whitewoods, so tall and impervious. Those were strong enough not to feel pain.

He _pulled_ on nothing and then tried to _push_ against that. This felt odd and familiar. It reminded him of his cycle, the push and pull working together. But where the push became the pull in the cycle, here they must embrace as lovers. They must remain themselves, each a whole, but forever intertwined.

A knife struck his leg, but he could still stand, so he ignored it.

The harmonics were not harmonizing. The _pull_ warred with the _push_ to create friction and waste energy.

Waste was ever the enemy.

Another knife clipped his head, and this time he reeled back. Some attacks could not be suffered in stillness. Yet to stillness he aspired, and so he calmly stood back up as blood leaked down his face.

It was better than tears.

_Pull_ and _push_. Harmonize the forces. Teach them to dance.

Dance.

Ellie danced sometimes. She sang to herself as she twirled and skipped and jumped to her own tune. Infuriating and beautiful, that girl.

The next knife struck his shoulder, but other parts of his body hurt, parts he could not recall being struck. How many knives had he endured unawares?

She was out, her brace empty, but he was no fool. He waited, and moments later, she recalled the knives to her person and meticulously replaced each one into the brace. A reprieve then, one he should not waste.

A tune.

Ellie always danced to a melody. Harmonics require a tune, something for them to dance to. But how can he sing to the _push_ and _pull_? A weird idea, foreign, but attractive. Sing the push, sing the pull, and make them dance.

A knife struck his shoulder in the same place as the first one. It caused his pain to increase into a rhythmic throb that pounded to the beat of his heart. It danced in a way. Layered wounds made for the best pain, throbbing each to their own tune, yet commiserating to make a greater whole.

“Are you... singing?”

She looked shocked and confused in an unusual display of emotion. Then she threw another knife. This one struck his other shoulder, yet another voice to the chorus. He listened to that chorus, accepted it, embraced it.

The _push_ and _pull_ began to dance.

They were invisible, yet he could feel the change, feel them shiver in sympathetic resonance to his melody. He felt that resonance and shifted the song, urging harmony and balance, willing the dance to continue, pushing it toward intimacy.

Another knife struck him, but he was barely aware. He’d lost himself in the dance, needed the harmony of the _push_ and the _pull_, felt the beautiful movement that made his pain worth every moment. The forces danced, and weaved, circled, and then, in one final moment of beautiful consumption, they embraced as lovers and shuddered as they solidified into one.

He felt a tear in his mind, and he looked up to see a knife firmly embedded in thin air.

He’d formed his shield.

He would never be defenseless again.
