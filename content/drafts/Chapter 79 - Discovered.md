# 79 | Discovered

Roland stalked out of the cave as he grumbled under his breath about irresponsible, idiotic girls. Why was it so damn important to her for him to have a pet? It was just an animal, they die all the time, and he was a hunter. It was his _job_ to kill them.

Why didn’t that feel right?

He’d never had an issue hunting before. He was the hunter, he was the predator. What did it matter if he killed its parents? Parents died all the time, _all_ the time. It was the way things were, especially here in this forest. They died, and because he was the predator, he killed them. He killed them, its parents. He’d stolen Skyra’s parents from her.

He stumbled and braced against the wall. Anger and guilt drove his hand against the stone. His breath came quick, and tears streamed down his face as he struggled to reign in memories parents he thought he’d buried long ago. He was supposed to be over this. He dealt with it, or maybe not, but he’d buried the memories.

He’d ripped her parents from her, just like—

He vowed then to protect Skyra with everything he had.

With that vow came... nothing. The air was still cold, the pain and guilt remained, his anger at Ellie unabated. He shook his head and briefly considered heading back, but just the prospect of dealing with Ellie set his teeth on edge. Maybe it was because she’d been right to insist. No, _especially_ because she’d been right all, he didn’t want to see her. It just felt too raw.

He did wish he’d found that shirt, though. He emerged from the mouth of the cave shivering, slightly hunched to avoid unnecessary bruises to his head, and then stopped at a sound he’d never expected to hear from the forest.

“Gods below, Jonah. What could have done that?”

“It looks a bit like a sword, a sharp one,” said a second voice, Jonah maybe.

“Out here? We run from these fuckers, not fight _two_ of them at once,” said the first voice.

“We shouldn’t be here.” A third, female voice. “Can someone explain again just why we haven’t chopped any one of these Whites down and dragged it back?” Roland got the sense she was pointing.

“Less of us to split the share. Besides, the trees are supposed to be much bigger deeper in. Imagine what we could sell one of those for.”

“I do believe beasts such as these grow larger further in as well.” A fourth voice?

“And how are we supposed to drag it back, Fin? We lose any more people, and you’ll be the one trying to haul it back.” Her tone suggested it was an unlikely scenario. “Besides, we’re dead if we ever meet anything like this... thing, whatever it is.”

“Oh no, not _my_ problem. I sure as hell don’t haul wood,” Fin replied.

Roland considered ducking back into the cave, but they’d already rounding in view and would see him either way. He didn’t know if they’d chase him into the cave or not, but he’d rather meet them out here than in there. Also, his curiosity was overriding caution, although he’d have preferred to meet them with a shirt.

“I agree with Anna,” said a fourth voice. “We should head back and grab one of the smaller trees. It’ll be enough for us with such diminished numbers and easier to carr— huh, who is that?”

All four of them had stopped to follow his gaze to Roland. Their expression shifted to disbelief, apparently unaccustomed to finding anyone alone in the forest.

“What in all the forgotten gods...” Roland identified him as the first voice, Fin. He wore a long sword sheathed at his side along with a simple bolt-caster on the opposite hip. He stared at Roland as though he were some specter. He rubbed his eyes and rechecked before confirming that yes, Roland was still there.

“Should we attack?”

“Dammit Fin, he’s just a boy.” The woman, Anna, turned and shot Fin a glare.

“I don’t see how—”

“And he’s shivering.” Though she didn’t seem to mind too much given the way her eyes lingered. He returned the favor and suddenly felt very, very conscious of his body. She was beautiful with a hint of exotic whispered by a light chocolate skin that seemed to blend into to chestnut eyes that drew his own to trap them. She also wore a fur coat, but it was longer and more form-fitting. He didn’t see any weapons on her but found himself double-checking just in case, and then again for good measure. Her lips twitched upward at the attention.

“I don’t give a damn if he’s shivering. He’s armed,” Fin said as he pulled out his bolt caster.

“A wooden sword?”

“Ah, look closer. That’s gravtech he’s holding.”

“Explains our beast back there, at least.” Roland snapped his eyes over to whom he’d guessed was Stan.

The fourth one, Jonah, remained silent but watched intently. Of the four, he looked the most dangerous to Roland. He carried himself as a soldier, with a rigid stance, and with a lance strapped to his back. That lance triggered an unease he could seem to shake.

Fin screwed his face up at Stan. “You think that _boy_ killed those beasts? Are you insane, Stanley? That boy sure a hell can’t know how to use it... probably took it off the poor sap those monsters killed.” He gestured at the dead Linrix.

Did he really look that much like a boy?

“Hmm, perhaps.”

“Maybe we should put him out of his— gods below, what is that?”

“Awww, it’s cute!”  Anna’s eyes grew almost comically large.

Roland felt something press against his leg and glanced down to see Skyra pressed up against his leg. Anna bent down and started walking toward Skyra with her arms out. At the same time, Fin raised his bolt caster but was blocked by Anna’s body.

“Are you insane, woman? Get out of my way.”

Roland tightened his grip on the sword, formed an edge, and shaped a shield in front of both him and Skyra. Stan had stayed back with an amused smirk on his face, but his eyes snapped to Roland the moment he raised a shield. Perhaps Jonah wasn’t the most dangerous one here.

“Come here, little one, I won’t hurt you!”

What was wrong with these people? They hadn’t even spoken to him.

Jonah took a step and put his hand on Anna’s shoulder. “Anna, get up. Fin, put your weapon down. Nobody’s threatened you, and you’re both being rude.”

Anna immediately got up and stepped back but continued to look on Skyra with some adoration. While Fin put his weapon down, he still maintained a tight grip on it.

“My name is Jonah, and this is Anna, Fin, and Stan... as you’ve no doubt figured out. What’s your name, boy?”

“Roland, are you loggers?”  He’d known expeditions were sent to cut down the Whitewoods, but he’d never expected to see one so deep in.

“No, we’re just the guard... or scouts as need dictates,” he waved back the way they’d come. “The loggers are back at camp.”

Fin snorted.

“Fin, I said shut it.”

Fin looked put out but clothed his mouth. It seemed like a common motion for him, as did the way he fingered his bolt caster. It was odd, though, for Roland would have guessed the man more comfortable with the sword at his hip. Fin’s fingers seemed to want that more than the caster.

In fact, they all looked to be on edge.

“It’s dangerous this deep in the forest,” Roland said.

“Yes,” Jonah drew the words slowly, “and so it is. Just where do you live, boy? Are you lost?”

Roland solidified his shield further when Jonah took a step forward. Stan placed a hand on his shoulder and gave a quick shake of his head. Jonah looked a little confused but stepped back.

Roland frowned as he realized that he had no idea where he was. His frantic flight down the mountain didn’t really give him time to orient himself, or perhaps it might have had he the wits to actually pay attention at the time. He might have a general idea of where his valley was, but that was about it.

His confusion must have shown.

“Well, tell you what. You want to come with us back to camp, we can get you some warm cloths and food. I don’t know how you got out here, but you were right about the danger. No guarantees, but we can provide some protection for you and get you back home. Do you know where you’re from?”

Roland blinked in surprise. He’d half expected to have to fight them, not get an offer for clothes and food. He glanced down at himself and realized just how he must look, an emaciated boy standing in front of a cave, shirtless with blood and mud stained trousers. His stomach growled audibly again. The offer of food was tempting, but he wasn’t going to move with Fin holding the caster like that.

Jonah followed Roland’s eyes and then narrowed in annoyance. “Fin, put that away. We’re not going to shoot the boy or his pet.”

Fin grumbled a little but did as he was told and replaced the bolt caster on his hip before resting his hand lightly on his sword pommel with his eyes locked to Roland.

“I promise you’ll be safe with us.”

Fin snorted.

Jonah closed his eyes and sighed. “As safe as one can be out here.”

Roland flicked his eyes between them once, then nodded. “I’ll grab my gear.”

He headed back into the cave without another word. As he expected, his clothes were still there, but Ellie was gone. He wouldn’t have expected her to stay around, though he felt a pang of disappointment at her absence.

He decided to donate his shirt to whoever would live here next, as it was little more than rags. He found a replacement in his pack and donned it as he tried to figure out what he was feeling. The answer, ironically, was not much else except hungry. These were the first new people he’d seen in years, but it just felt surreal. He didn’t know whether he should feel excited or terrified.

He grabbed his coat and paused. Maybe it wasn’t just hunger he felt, maybe the ache was more than that. He shook off the thought, threw his coat on, and vacated the small cave.

He could hear an argument brewing between the four, but they fell silent as he emerged from his cave. It was probably about him and the wisdom of allowing a clearly wild boy into their midst.

“Huh, so he has cloths,” Anna said with a curious disappointment in her voice.

Jonah gave a relieved smile. “Good, you have some gear. Come, we’ll take you to the camp. Stay close, though. I don’t know how you’ve survived this long, but I’d hate to see you dead now.”

“Woah, we’re not done scouting. I’m sure there’s larger trees further in.” Fin’s voice tilted upward.

Jonah shook his head and kept walking. “No, we’ve scouted enough for the day. No sense in putting the boy here in more danger than he already is.”

Fin scowled at Roland and grumbled under his breath as he turned to follow Jonah.

“Well, I, for one, look forward to some hot stew.” Stan gave Roland a quick wink. “They caught some good meat yesterday.”

“Nice to eat it fresh for once,” Anna said as she also turned to follow Jonah. Roland noticed that she deliberately put herself on the opposite side of Fin. The two seemed to dislike each other a bit, or maybe they had history. The idea twisted unnaturally in his stomach.

Roland started to walk but stopped when he accidentally kicked Skyra. He knelt down and scratched her behind the ears.

“Well, little one, I guess we follow.”

He picked her up and placed her on his shoulder, where she immediately curled up around his neck. He turned to see Stan watching him curiously. He gave him a one-shouldered shrug and began walking. Stan caught up and matched his pace. He expected Stan to ask questions, prod, talk, or something, yet he walked silently and left Roland to his own thoughts.

He decided that Stan was the most perceptive of the group. That made him dangerous, especially since he noticed Roland’s shield, which almost certainly meant he had gravic training.

Jonah was obviously the leader, something he seemed to do naturally, and... that was all. He’d said little, but he was the one to offer food, so Roland was prone to like the man, no matter that the lance made him nervous on an instinctual level.

He didn’t really know what to think about Fin. The man had a dangerous, if flippant, look to him, like he was trying to hide his own skill. Roland couldn’t help but think the man’s first instinct was to grab his sword.

And Anna was butterflies in his stomach. He tried hard not to think about that.

It was weird to travel so slowly through the woods and see the trees move by so gradually. He was so accustomed to flying through the trees that at first, he found himself feeling antsy.

He felt exposed, though some of that may have been the obsene amount of noise the group made. They crashed through the snow and brush with an abandon that brought unbidden to mind his younger self crashing leaves in an attempt to find a rabbit. He could not help but wonder just how much of the forest could hear it, and then how they survived at all.

“I felt what you did back there,” Stan said.

Roland looked over at him. “And?”

Stan shrugged. “Not too many can form a shield like that.”

“Not many can sense gravics either.”

Stan looked over with a small smile. “True. It’s a fairly advanced specialty at the college. How long have you been practicing?”

Roland closed his eyes and shook his head slowly. “Not sure.” It was a sore point for him, how the years had blended together.

“Really? You must have some talent then.”

The line of questioning was uncomfortable, so he sought to change the subject. “You can form a shield?”

“Mmm hmmm,” Stan replied, but his tone made Roland suspicious.

“You can shape?”

Stan stopped and looked sharply over at Roland. “Yes, I can, although something tells me I’m not the first shaper you’ve met.”

“Why do you say that?”

“Because most people would ask if I was a Shaper or even a Sorcerer or Magician in some parts. You asked if I could _shape_, like it was nothing more than a tool, and far too casually, as though you were familiar with it. Shapers are precious few, and we garner something of a reputation that makes most people speak of us with...”

“Awe?” It was certainly how he’d have viewed it when he was a child.

“Hmm, and we tend to know each other.”

“Oh.” Roland started walking again.

“And you?”

He looked back over at Stan, who once again was keeping pace.

“What?”

“You can shape?”

“A little. Nothing complicated.”

Stan nodded thoughtfully and fell silent, leaving Roland to his thoughts again. He felt an urge to talk with the man about everything even remotely related to gravics, but how far could he trust him? How much could he reveal about himself and Rose? Not much, not anything without risking thier lives. Rose had him out here for a reason. People just didn’t come out here and expect to survive. She’d kill them if they knew, or he would. Or they’d try to kill him and then he’d kill them.

“So if you’re a shaper, why are you out here? I thought shapers were paid well.”

Stan’s face suddenly looked ill. “Yeah, you’d think so. But it’d take a lifetime to pay off my debt... if that’s even possible.” He shook his head in anger. “Turns out, piss off the wrong Royal, and they put quite a slave bounty on you. The only way I could pay it off is in these woods, providing I survive. Can’t help but think that was the point.”

“Wait, so they tried to make you a slave just because you made a Royal angry?”

“Ha! No... well, sort of. That Royal could have made me a slave right then and there. Instead, he put a bounty on me and told me to run. Always a game with them.”

That didn’t seem right. There had to be protection against that sort of thing.

“Oh, don’t get me wrong. With what his daughter and I... ah, well, let’s just say he was in his rights.”

Oh.

“I think you’ll find many similar stories among us. Rational people don’t come here unless there’s no other choice. Well, most anyway...” He trailed off as he looked ahead at Fin’s back with a pensive look.

Again their walk descended into silence, Stan in his thoughts, Roland not wanting to risk further inquiry. That wasn’t likely though, was it? They’d want to know about him, how he got here, how he survived here. How much could he keep hidden, and for how long? Even now, he was sure Stan was trying to find another way to pry loose his secrets.

He should just leave, walk away. No, run away, but every time his mind approached the idea, it reeled back with a type of hunger he hadn’t allowed himself for a long time. That hunger burned his curiosity.

“What’s it like?”

Stan looked over with glazed eyes. “Hmmm?”

“Your college. What’s it like?”

“Oh...” He smiled sadly and seemed to withdraw into himself until Roland wondered whether he’d actually reply.

“Tall, mysterious spires no one’s allowed in. Large, wide, squat buildings covered in snow, holding countless students. Long halls with endless doors. An endless library jelously guarded. Catacombs... ha, they have _catacombs_... and cold rooms reading large books by a fireplace. Teachers fighting for you. Teachers fighting against you. Panic attacks over exams. The joy of learning something new, of growing, of becoming. Endless competition and massive egos. Rivalries with other students. Competitions and...” he glanced over at Roland with shining eyes and let out a guilty chuckle, “*magic. duels.*  Ah... exploring with friends, doing stupid things with friends...” he grunted and shook his head, “doing even dumber things with girls.”

Roland’s eyes fell as sorrow and longing clenched his heart. It sounded foreign, incomprehensible, distant, and... “It sounds wonderful.”

“It is.” Stan studied him for a time. “You know, I could get you in.”

“In?”

“The school, college. You have talent, obviously, and... well, aside from the whole slave-bounty thing, I have good standing there. I would sponsor you.”

For just a moment, hope broke through the clouds and offered another life. “You don’t even know me.”

Stan shrugged. “Maybe not, but you seem like a good kid, and talent like yours would gain you entrance in moments.”

Roland’s breath quickened for a moment at the offer. He tried to imagine those halls, so many students, teachers that weren’t trying to kill him, exploring catacombs, and friends... he tried to imagine friends, but it never resolved. He had only one friend in his life and rarely did he see her.

And all because of Rose.

The suffocation collapsed back on him, clouds hid the hope, and he realized that no matter what Stan offered him, it simply would never happen. Rose controlled everything, consumed everything.

The sun had descended into evening before they finally reached the camp. Their group scattered. Jonah and Anna appeared to be in some kind of argument but as soon as the camp came into view she broke off at a jog. Fin stalked into camp without a word, hands in pockets, as he purposefully ignored everyone around him. Stan gave a small smile before heading off.

Roland hadn’t dared to look at the camp yet. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath to steady himself from the flutters of nervous excitement in his stomach. It seemed a lifetime since he’d been around any group of people, and the idea of so many people in one place made his skin crawl. Part of him wanted to walk back in, the other part screamed at him to run. So he took another breath, placed all his concerns in it, and then slowly blew them out as he opened his eyes and took in the camp.
