# 21 | Burn [Roland]

Larstead was not a large town, but it could at least be called one. Hidden deep in the mountains and nestled in a valley, it had a single export: wood. That alone elevated it above a village. But it also hosted a small but diverse set of supporting businesses, and there were more than enough homes and flats that many sat empty, just waiting for a family to imbue it their memories. The town had cobblestone roads and a stream that ran along the only road into it though a narrow gap and on to line the eastern edge of the valley.

It was perfect except for one glaring flaw: it was on fire.

Five years ago, old man Shem's house burned down. He'd taken to the bottle in his later years, after his Mrs died, and while nobody could figure out exactly how he'd managed the feat — his house had no fireplace, was heated by gravtech, and his memory of the night decidedly lacking — those roaring flames had impressed deeply on Roland's then six year old mind.

The fire had been a living thing that night, consuming both the man's home and his memories with the kind of voracious appetite known only to monsters. Roland had nightmares for months. In them, the fire's tendrils would reach out and consume his very soul, and only his parent's embrace could settle those fears.

In the end, his parents took him to see the burnt out shell of Mr Shem's home. No other home had been touched by the fire, and that more than anything had settled his dreams.

Why, then, did the fire spread now was beyond him. Yet it instilled a kind of primal terror he once thought long buried. The fire hadn't yet spread to his house, which sat deeper in town. His first instinct was to run straight toward home, but the stream would run swift and deep this time of year.

He turned toward the road and sprinted.

Roland came upon and then slowed at a flat wooden bridge, barely more than a few planks of wood tied together. He crossed quickly then paused. Just beyond was the road.

The clean smell of rain had been fouled with smoke. Shouts filled the wind, then laughter, then vanished, leaving the night feeling silent in the storm's deafening fury.

A scream pierced it.

Fear drove Roland to the edge of the road. He crept, bent and low, thighs burning. From tree to tree he went, hiding from eyes he couldn't see nor knew were there. It didn't matter, for in his mind those eyes were everywhere, born from the unholy coupling of night and storm.

After what felt like a lifetime, he came upon a low stone wall, opposite of the inn, the start of Larstead. The wall stretched into the forest, where it rounded and would eventually connect to the back of Mr Jenson's shop, the local Cobbler. He followed it until about halfway, where he jumped the wall.

He pressed into a wooded thicket, as quiet as he could, and crept passed the old ghosts of half remembered adventures of a much younger self. The sounds of violence drifted through the trees, muffled, while his steps thundered and cracked and crackled.

He approached the edge carefully, lay down on his belly, and crawled. With elbows he pushed under the brush until his face just barely peeked from under the thicket edge, looking into the inn's courtyard.

The inn was dark while its courtyard lit by flame. Opposite of it, the smith's shop burned.

Mr. Henderson stood with his daughter Laurice, both backs to the inn, facing the courtyard. Three soldiers lined up before them. Mr. Henderson's one hand was raised, palm out, facing them. The other clenched his daughter's hand. Her tears streamed down a terrified face. His too, but instead of terror there was nothing but sorrow.

The soldiers had leveled their lances. From the tip of each lance space twisted on itself, catching the light of the fire behind and bending it. With no warning, they raced toward the Hendersons only to refract off an invisible wall to hit inn behind them, tearing chunks from the stone.

"Fucking shielder!" one of the soldier cried out, then spat.

Hope sprang up and chocked Roland's throat. Mr Henderson was a shielder. Shielders were rare individuals that could use their gravics to form barriers. They were highly sought after, and it seemed impossible his town would have one.

It tasted like hope.

The soldiers didn't relent. Shot after shot they fired, and as they did their warps inched ever closer to the pair. One of the soldiers gasped and fell to his knees. With him out, Mr. Henderson's shield seemed to hold, though it maintained only a pace before him.

Roland twitched forward. He should help; he needed to help; they would die without help. He willed his legs to move, his arms to crawl, his body to leave the safety of his bush.

His body refused.

But it was okay. Mr Henderson was a shielder. He was strong; he would protect them. Roland waited for him to protect them. He _had_ to; there was no one else.

The third solider regained his feet.

It couldn't be real; his mind refused to accept it. Reality became a weak and flexible thing. Roland floated above it, watching a dream of a dream as the soldiers continued their onslaught. Henderson's shield was barely before them, barely enough. It was like a story told with no consequence. The gruff inn keeper turned suddenly, wrapped his daughter in his arms, and whispered something in her ear. Terror and tears were on her face before she buried them in his shoulder.

A moment later, nothing was left except a bloody mess.

A scream filled the night.

The soldiers all turned at once to Roland and forced reality to crash back into him. The night turned bright, the flames hot, the sound of them a roar in his ears.

The soldiers fired into the woods with chest-felt thwamps that filled the air. Their warps shredded bush around and above him, but mostly above.

They couldn't see him.

Roland pushed himself back.

One soldier gestured to another, who then jogged toward where Roland was hidden.

Roland abandoned stealth and crashed through the brush. Cracks of broken brushwood filled his ears but he didn't care. He pushed though entangling, grasping undergrowth, pulling on them for leverage with desperate hands.

Suddenly, the brush became stone and he was pulling himself over it.

He followed the wall, glanced behind himself, followed the wall, looked behind, followed the wall, and it became the back of the Cobbler shop.

He stopped, turned around, listened. The sounds of broken branches were muffled, then nothing. Distant, angry voices came next, but then faded, leaving Roland with nothing but the pounding of his heart and the roar of fire to fill his ears.

He continued to follow the shop's wall until its end, his steps lit by flickering light. He pressed his back against the stone, then yelped at the pain. He pushed off, looked up, and jumped away just in time to avoid the fall of burning wood and collapsing stone.

He stared at the burning wood, mouth dry. He blinked once, twice.

They killed them. How could this happen?

The question floated, ephemeral and without form. It could not take hold because it had nothing to hold on to. There were no paths for his mind to follow, not even a hint of an answer.

Laurice was dead.

The fire flared up with brilliant red-tinged oranges. It raced up newly exposed wood, as eager as a predator would pounce its prey. Mindless, endless hunger.

But Laurice was nice to everyone. It was a stupid thought, but the wrongness of it enveloped Roland.

Fire consumed the wood, consumed the world, and filled the night with smoke.

And Mr. Henderson was a shielder. He should have protected them; he should have protected them all.

Another section collapsed, bringing down more stone and a significant portion of the roof. Roland jumped back as the fire flared up into searing whites.

He should have saved them but he didn't, and Roland was left alone in a world of monsters.

Roland watched as stone cracked under the heat. The sound brought him back to himself, and one single thought pushed through above all others.

His parents. Where were his parents?

Roland ran, his mind suddenly consumed with thoughts of home.

Beyond the cobbler was the tanner, but he'd erected a fence around the open air pavilion under which hung dozens of pelts. Roland aimed to head into the forest when he saw movement within the pelts. He couldn't know if it were soldiers, but he diverted toward the street instead.

There were no soldiers in the street. It was odd, but only in the back of his head. He sprinted down it, past the grocer from which he heard the screams of Mrs Tansen cut short. He ran past the butcher, whose burning shop blended the smells of cooked steak into the smoke. He ran past the tailor's shop, which burned with such ferocity that it forced Roland to shy away. The tinker's shop did not burn, but within were half a dozen shapes looting the valuable tech inside.

Roland ran as fast as his legs could take him and took the first right as the road split. He ran past homes, some dark, others burning, others empty. He ran past homes from which pleas and screams and shouts assaulted his mind. He ignored them all, his mind consumed with a single purpose.

He ignored all but one.

Preston sat in the middle of the road just before the second v, one hand behind for support, his face a rictus of terror. He was scooting himself back with his feet, but the motion was wrong, off balanced, as though he were moments from tipping over. Before him were two soldiers. One was laughing a taunt; the other stood far side from Roland, obscured from view. The laughing soldier leveled his lance at Preston.

Preston deserved every bruise, every busted lip, and every black eye Roland had ever given him. He deserved it all. But not this. Never this. Of all things, he did not deserve this.

Reality gained weight; time slowed. Before the tip of the lance could warp light, it twisted space. Roland could _feel_ it warp the space, as though a god had pinched the fabric of reality, and twisted it, round and round and round. Space collapsed on itself, stretched, rippled, warped. Over and over, it pulled more of itself into itself. Light bent around the warp, giving it presence, but Roland hardly noticed that; he'd already felt it.

He could feel the weight of all things. He could _touch_ them.

There was a finality in the twisting, a tying, cutting off. He knew the moment the warp would release. He knew before the soldier did.

In that moment, he _pushed_.

The warp raced toward Preston, then veered away from Roland and missed Preston by several paces. Cobblestone cracked where it hit.

The laughing soldier stopped laughing. He took a step back, flipped the lance up, and stared at it, head cocked with a quizzical expression.

He never even saw Roland barrel into him.

In Roland's mind, the soldier went flying into his partner, stunning them both. He would grab Preston and run away before either soldier knew what happened.

Instead, he bounced off the soldier, who took two stumbling steps before his partner steadied him, leaving Roland dazed and on the ground. This lasted only a moment, for Roland's mind was still following his first plan.

He stumbled over to Preston.

"Come on, Preston. Preston. _Preston._ Come on. *Preston!*"

But Preston's eyes were glazed and unfocused, his skin white and pasty. His mouth opened and closed but nothing came out.

Roland reached to grab his shoulder and only then noticed that Preston did not have an arm.

Lightning flashed, revealing a road filled with blood.

Roland stumbled back in horror, bounced off something, and landed on his knees. A weight grew behind him and pulled at him. Before he could think, it raced forward. It pulled at his head, ripped out his hair, and continued on to strike Preston in the chest.

Where it struck, it pulled, collapsing Preston's chest inward, pulling his remaining shoulder down at an unnatural angle. It didn't stop, but took what it had collected and continued on into the cobblestone beyond, which cracked from the strain before the warp dissipated and deposited the remains of Preston's chest on the road.

Only a solitary, coherent thought remained in Roland's mind: run.

He took two step before his world exploded in light. He felt himself fall and his forehead smack against the ground, but it all felt distant. For a few seconds, the entire world went silent. He slowly turned himself over and saw two blurry shapes looming over him.

"Hey boy! You trying to run?"

Roland tried to bring the world back into focus.

"I think he was trying to run. Jordek, what do you think?"

"Sure looked like it," Jordek said with a tired, annoyed voice.

"You like running, boy?"

The shapes slowly resolved into two young soldiers, each holding a lance. One was thin, narrow faced, hooked nose, weak jaw— the laughing soldier. The other was a muscle-bound specimen of a man who would draw looks, only to find them averted after a glance from his face, which had clearly seen too many knife fights. After a second, the laughing soldier punched Roland in the stomach with the butt of his lance.

"Boy! I was talking to you."

He poked again, hard enough that Roland reflexively curled up.

"Jordek, you think he's stupid?"

Jordek rolled his eyes.

"You know all these village folk are stupid. It's all that in-breeding, fucking their own sisters. Hey boy," he kicked Roland's back, "you ever fuck your sister?"

When Roland didn't answer, he kicked again. "I bet he has. Stupid fuck."

"Let's just kill him and move on," Jordek said.

Roland began to cry. He didn't intend to. He wanted to get up and fight, to scream, to destroy his tormentors, but the only thing that would come out were tears.

"On no, Jordek. Look what you did. You made the poor boy cry. Hey boy, you want your mummy or did you fuck her too?"

Roland scooted away from them. Jordek raised his lance but the other one pushed it way.

"You know what Jordek, I think he likes running. Go on boy, get up. It's okay."  He handed his lance to Jordek and raised his hands. "See? I won't stop you. All you gotta do is get up and run."

Roland got up and ran.

"Ha, see! I told you he likes running. Give me my lance."

Roland took about a dozen steps before he heard the distinctive thwamp of the lance. Something pulled at his arm and spun him around. Off balance, he stumbled and fell.

"Not good enough. You gotta run faster," the laughing soldier yelled from behind.

Roland tried to push back to his feet but gasped from a sharp pain in his arm and collapsed. He looked at it and saw a small chunk of his shoulder missing.

"Better hurry, I'm getting bored!"

He looked back to see the soldiers had jogged to within a few paces. The other one turned to Jordek, who had an annoyed look on his face.

"Come on, Jordek, I know you wanna try. See if you can clip his other arm."

Jordek scowled, then aimed the lance at Roland's chest. The space around the tip of the lance bent and twisted the light. The other man shoved the lance just as it let out a loud thwamp and sent a warp to tear up the ground.

"What the fuck are you doing?"

Roland stared at the broken ground and began to whimper.

The laughing soldier gave Jordek an angry look, walked up to Roland, and kicked him in the forehead. His head snapped back, his body followed and struck the ground. He rolled over to his hands and knees and tried to reign in his tears.

"Run dammit!" The soldier kicked Roland's butt, which drove him head first into the street.

Roland struggled up and ran as the soldier laughed.

The rain had picked unnoticed and created a slick sheen on the cobblestone. His feet slipped and his legs flailed. The rain mixed with his tears to blur everything. Lightning struck, causing him to flinch and loose his footing. He heard a thwamp as he fell.

"Dammit!"

Roland scrambled back to his feet and sprinted down the road. He tried to find home but the houses were all wrong. He'd meant to go home, but he was heading down the wrong street. He veered left so quickly his feet almost came out from under him.

Another thwamp pulled on his hair painfully.

"Gods dammit Jordek, I'm loosing my touch here."

He caught himself on his hands and used them to help propel him toward a darkened house. He angled for the far side and sprinted on legs that felt like jelly. He rounded the corner of the house as he heard two thwamps, followed by the sound of collapsed wood and cracked stone. Then another thwamp, followed by another one.

The laughing soldier had stopped playing.

The house began to creak and groan as Roland ran beside it. Just as he reached the back, the front corner buckled outward.

Curses followed Roland. He veered right, down the yard of one house and into the yard of another. He darted around the far corner of the adjacent house.

The sound of thwamps almost tripped him up, and for a moment he thought himself dead, but the sound had come from within the nearest house. He stumbled, but didn't fall. A distant part of his mind recognized this house, knew the people in it; they lived almost across from him.

He had no thought for them at all. Only one concern dominating his mind: he was close. Almost there. His parents. He would see his parents.

He rounded the corner of the house into a new street well lit from fire. He saw his home, sprinted toward it, and rushed through what was left of the front door.

He saw his father first, fallen before his mother, face frozen in a grimace of stubborn determination. His mother, forced to watch the death of her husband, had only horror on her face. The looks on their faces burned Roland's mind.

He froze in the doorway, unable to process the conflicting realities as his expectations shattered against the scene of death before him.

He was home; he was safe; his parents were dead.

"Gods, it's just not your day, is it?"

Roland spun to see the two soldiers standing under the porch overhang, just out of the rain. Jordek had a thoroughly frustrated look on his face. The laughing soldier merely looked amused by the night's entertainment.

Jordek raised his lance.

"No!" The other one pushed aside the lance. "Dammit Jordek, are you trying to ruin my fun?"

Jordek spun and shoved him. "This is not a game, Oren."

Oren glared at him for a moment, then suddenly thrust the butt of his lance into Roland's face. Roland staggered back, holding a busted nose with his fingers.

"Does that look like a game, Jordek?"

"Come on, man. This ain't right."

Oren flipped the lance over and stabbed Roland in the shoulder. Roland gasped at the sudden pain, grabbed the lance, and tried to push it back out. Oren shoved it deeper.

"You know why they made me sergeant and not you?"

Oren's voice had grown angry and loud. Jordek clenched his jaw and his nose flared, but he said nothing.

"Because I actually _like_ my fucking job."

Oren kicked Roland in the chest and off the lance. Roland stumbled back several steps, then tripped over his dad's body and onto his mother's.

"Hey boy," Oren taunted, "just turn around and you can suck your momma's teat. You know you want to."

"Dammit, Oren. What is wrong with you?"

Oren looked as though he wanted to stab Jordek, but instead walked over to Roland and tried to stab him in the other shoulder. Roland rolled out of the way, barely missing the sharp end, which gouged into the floor. Oren cursed as Roland came up to his feet.

Roland screamed at Oren a wordless fury until his breath gave out. Something had broke in him and let all the rage out.

Oren took a step back in surprise and smiled.

"Finally grew a spin, eh?"  He turned to Jordek. "See that? _That's_ what you're missing."

Roland screamed again and rushed the man, who turned, swung, and struck Roland across the face with the lance butt, sending him into the wall. He tried to keep himself upright, but the world spun, his eyes wouldn't work, and his legs felt weak. He slid down the wall as they gave out.

Jordek said something, Oren responded. Jordek spoke again in a heated tone but their words sounded like they spoke under water. Oren responded, then gestured to Roland, who had only just managed to bring everything into focus. Whatever they were saying, Oren was livid.

Roland managed back to his feet.

Oren suddenly turned and gave Roland a cruel smile.

"Did you like fucking your momma?" he asked.

Roland's jaw clenched, lips curled in rage, teeth clenched, breath ragged. Oren kept his eyes on Roland, but aimed the lance at his mother's face.

Roland felt cold as the space bent around the lance. Time slowed again; again, he felt the weight of the world. The thwamp became loud in his head, as though he could feel it more than hear it. He _pushed_ on that feeling and the warp curved away from his mother to hit the floor beside her.

Oren stared at the floor in confusion, then looked at his lance as though it were broken. His eyes trailed back up to Roland and narrowed, but Roland saw fear in them.

He held on to that feeling, relished it. Here was power; here the world bent to him; here he was master.

He _pushed_ on the world and the world bent to his will. Space stretched in places, compressed in others. The wall beside him exploded out. Both Oren and Jarek looked as though they'd stood in front of a bent mirror, stretched out in the middle, compressed at the ends.

Oren took a step back, eyes wide. He aimed his lance at Roland. The tip of his lance distorted space but it was a small and paltry thing. He shot it directly at Roland only for the warp to veer up and into the ceiling.

Roland poured all his rage into his _push_. A loud, low-toned thrumming filled the room as ripples began to flow through the warped field that surrounded him.

Jordek fled.

Oren poured as much as he could into his lance, far more than his training told him was safe, and shot out a distortion with a black core. It stretched as it approached Roland, then dissipated as though it had travelled thousands of paces.

Oren collapsed, having exhausted his energy. He panicked and began crawling for the door as the distortion around Roland grew larger.

Roland fed everything he had into the _push_, which fed off his rage. The field expanded, distorting space until nothing was recognizable.

As the field expanded, anything it touched stretched, tore apart, and then was pulled and compressed into the ripples that flowed within it. The interior walls disintegrated, and then a support wall. The roof collapsed, tore apart, and then it too disintegrated before it could drop more than a couple paces.

Oren kept trying to get up but gravity had shifted toward Roland. The wind became a tornado centered on the flowing distortion. Oren clawed at the ground, tearing fingernails as he tried to get away, but slowly he was pulled in. He screamed in frustration, then he cried. He tried to curl up into a ball but felt his body stretch and tear apart. He screamed out an inhuman sound of utter pain. Then, he died.

Roland could see none of it. The wold had become a reflection of his rage, a twisting fury of meaningless color, a spinning amalgamated cacophony of light that consumed his mindless scream.

Something broke, and Roland pressed on nothing at all.

The rippling of the field warp stopped. In that same instant, the space around the warp stretched reality and pulled it inward. The surrounding homes collapsed in towards Roland, the pieces of which stretched and flew ever faster toward the field, though they gained no ground over space that stretched faster than the pieces were pulled.

In the next instant, the stretching continued into the valley beyond and pulled it all in, as though a god had bunched reality up around Roland. The town collapsed in to the field, compressed into a space no wider than a finger. The pressure incinerated everything, tearing it all down into their component parts.

The field became a wave. It roiled outward in all directions, pulling everything into it as it expanded, compressing and shredding virtually all matter it touched, turning it to dust.

The storm above was pulled in, then torn apart. Below, stone was pulverized, collapsing caverns and caves, changing the very topography of the area.

As the wave continued outward, it's boundaries weakened until it's pull had atrophied enough that matter wasn't simply dissolving within it. By the time it had reached twenty leagues, everything it touched was torn apart, but recognizable as material, if not structure. By thirty leagues, trees were ripped out and brush scattered as though a god had scraped the ground. By forty leagues it looked as though a massive windstorm had swept the area. Beyond that, foundations cracked and homes collapsed. People would swear there was an earthquake, though none had ever been known in the area.

Only a few moments later, Roland stood on the remains of the only foundation left of his town, a perfect circle barely three paces wide. He stood in a valley devoid of life under a star-filled night made hazy by dust.

Exhaustion unlike any he'd ever known pulled him to his knees.

Distant thunder echoed throughout the valley and rumbled from the earth. They were the only sounds that could be heard.

Roland fell to his hands. His arms shook, then collapsed. He took a breath of dust, the remains of all he'd ever known. He coughed and darkness chased his vision until oblivion claimed his mind a moment later.
