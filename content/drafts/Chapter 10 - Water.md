# 10 | Water [Oliver]

Oliver woke slowly to the sound of dripping water.

Consciousness brought with it a wave of pain as hundreds of cuts and bruises, flayed skin, and aching bones all competed for attention. Just the idea of moving made him nauseous.

He might have laid there for hours if not for the incessant sound of water tapping on itself. The sound was foreign, burrowing into his head with such a strong sense of _wrongness_ that virtually forced Oliver's eyes open.

Water was being wasted, and it went against every instinct he had.

He lay on his back, one arm pinned beneath him at an unnatural angle.

He very carefully tried to move his arm, but pain flared in his shoulder and almost drove him unconscious. His breath came fast; sparks danced in his eyes.

Dislocated. He'd heard it was painful, but this...this was a whole other level. He looked around, trying to distract himself while the pulsing torture subsided.

He lay at an angle with his feet propped up on a rock pile. Probably the remains of the floor. Above, walls of sharp stone tapered inward into the darkness, giving the illusion that they must meet further up, though he doubted that was the case given he'd fallen through it.

Or perhaps not. The walls may well have collapsed on themselves after he'd fallen. Didn't matter. There was no way he could climb it.

He frowned, then blinked, then blinked again.

He could see.

He should not be able to see.

Irrational hope sprung up in his chest. Light meant people. People meant he was saved. Hells below, he'd even take Flatface and Fatboy. They could beat him up to their heart's content if it meant getting out of there.

He jerked, again trying to unpin his arm. An explosion of pain radiated from his shoulder. Sparks flared in his eyes, then merged into a blinding radiance that exploded into black.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Oliver woke again to the sound of dripping water.

"Ugh..." The sound echoed weirdly close like he was in a small room.

He opened his eyes slowly. Nothing had changed above. The same walls greeted him, barely lit until they receded into the dark.

His mouth was filled with paste that stuck his tongue to whatever it touched. He was hot enough that he should be sweating.

He had to move, but the idea of his shoulder kept him staring at nothing for a long time.

"Hello?" His voice came out cracked and dry.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. The sound of water was the only reply.

He considered yelling but he didn't think he was capable.

Water. He needed water.

He did not try to pull his arm out. He'd learned that lesson well enough. Instead, he rolled over very, very slowly. Every slight movement was a lesson in torture. The pain radiated outward, causing other muscles to seize up. He continued anyway until he reached a tipping point.

His body flopped, his shoulder screamed, light flared in his eyes...

---

Oliver Sands woke to the sound of dripping water.

He was face down this time, nose pressed against the cool stone.

"Oh fluuu..." was all he could manage.

The paste had dried, firmly affixing his tongue to the top of his mouth. His shoulder felt...better? It still throbbed, but he got the sense it wasn't as dire as before. He tried to move it.

Nope. Still hurt. A lot. Sparks danced in his eyes.

He waited for oblivion to take him again, but after a few seconds, he realized it wouldn't happen.

He was truly stuck with his pain.

Deep breath, and he pushed himself up with his good arm.

His shoulder screamed—or he did—and darkness took him...again.

---

Oliver Sands woke to the sound of dripping water.

He was on his back again, which was becoming an unfortunate habit. He lay on the rock pile with his head elevated enough to see the walls instead of the ceiling, or, well, the black above at least.

He tilted his head to examine his bad arm. It looked...fine? His shoulder didn't look quite right, but it wasn't the mangled mess he'd imagined it to be.

Maybe it wouldn't hurt this time?

He pushed himself up, slowly this time and—nope. Still hurt, a lot.

He paused a few seconds, then continued. His shoulder ached but it wasn't the searing pain from before. By the time he sat up fully, he was breathing hard and had broken into a sweat.

He was also conscious. A win, that.

Oliver examined his new home while his shoulder gave a well-thought-out, if not overly loud debate on the merits of laying down. He let it rant while examining his new home.

It was a small, narrow cave with tilted walls and a slanted floor that was oddly smooth. Oliver and his rocks were piled up on one side at the top of the floor. A crack along the far wall cast a green-tinted light that filled everything in his cave except for a patch of darkness running along the bottom edge of the floor, near where it met the wall.

He stared at that darkness, confused. At first, he thought it was a shadow, but with nothing to cast that shadow, he was forced to dismiss the idea. A new idea wormed into his head, one he didn't like.

No, he didn't like that idea at all.

Oliver reached back—with his good arm, of course—and grabbed a rock. He tossed it into the shadow, where it did not land.

He waited. After a few seconds, he thought he heard a crack, though it was hard to tell over the sound of dripping water.

Oliver Sands was not in a cave. He was in a shaft, sitting on a rock shelf that could collapse at any time. _Would_ collapse if Ionia woke up again.

It was not a comforting thought. It was, in fact, a rather terrifying thought that forced Oliver to his feet...

...where he swayed while tiny little fireflies danced in his eyes. And his shoulder renewed its argument with fervor, along with every single bruise and scrape. Flamin' sands, even his bones ached.

He stood there for several minutes until he was certain he could walk without falling over. Or mostly certain.

He very slowly approached the edge, where the ledge stopped two paces from the opposing wall. About chest level was the crack that let in light. It took him only a moment to realize that was also where the sound of water came from.

He needed through that crack, but it wasn't wide enough for him to fit through, not even if he voided his lungs.

He tore his gaze from it and walked the perimeter of his ledge. It took less than a minute before he stood opposite the crack, staring at the light.

It was his only hope.

Oliver tilted over the hole, his good arm propped against the wall to hold him up. With the gap less than two paces across, it wasn't hard. He leaned in and pressed his face against the stone with his eyes peering through the crack in the wall.

A world of green greeted him, all lit up by streaks of green climbing up the cave walls, intensity fading as his eyes trailed up. Bright Moss.

That was...worrisome, not to mention confusing. Bright Moss, sometimes called Blight Moss, was something of a scourge on Ionia. It only appeared near water, which might have been considered fortuitous if it didn't also contaminate the water and turn it hallucinogenic.

Ionians had long ago learned how to infuse the moss into the brewing process, creating a potent drink that wreaked havoc on a person's graescence along with softening their sense of reality. Pleasantly, of course. Or usually. Oliver had heard stories of drinks gone bad, but he'd never seen it happen.

The moss was banned in the Empire, which went to extreme measures to prevent it from crossing the gate to Rotaka. They waged a ceaseless war against the moss to keep their massive underground cisterns clean for all the crops growing above. The last thing they wanted was to distribute hallucinogenic food across the Empire.

They did not, however, mind selling the dead moss back to the outer districts, who, in a fit of irony, mostly used it to keep their water clean, which they also got from the Empire. In small doses, it worked as an anti-bacterial agent. In large doses, it made alcohol the greatest drink in both worlds. Or so he'd heard—he'd never had the chance to try it himself.

But put live moss in water and it could kill a man. Or at least the water could. The moss itself was technically edible if you could avoid the water.

Or so they said.

Oliver pushed himself back from the wall and walked to the pile of rubble. His head throbbed fiercely, half from concussion, half from dehydration, so he didn't spend a lot of time analyzing the rocks. He grabbed one that fit comfortably in his hand and walked back to the ledge.

He leaned over it again, bracing himself with the stone in his good hand while his eyes were drawn to the darkness. It grew in his vision, seeming to reach out to swallow him up.

Nope. He shut his eyes until the vertigo passed, then recentered them on the stone. Slowly, he let his head rest against the cool stone. A moment passed before he took a deep breath and transferred the weight from his hand to his head.

Pain spiked, then slowly receded into a throbbing pain that beat to the rhythm of his heart.

With a deep breath, he drew back the stone and struck the wall, sending a large chip careening into the cave beyond.

Pain pierced his head and shoulder and for a moment he thought he might pass out again. He didn't, and after the torment abated, he struck the wall again.

And then again, and again, until time blurred into an endless litany of self-inflicted torture.

---

Oliver woke to the sound of dripping water, the tapping sound drilling into his ears.

He was folded over something hard, head dangling while blood pounded against his skull in a desperate attempt to escape his body. His mouth was so dry he wasn't sure he'd ever open it again.

It took a long time for him to realize he was in the green cave...or halfway, at least.

Oliver couldn't remember when the hole became large enough for him to crawl through. Nor could he recall actually crawling through it. The pain, though, _that_ he recalled clearly.

He must have passed out halfway through. Slowly, because his head was spinning, he tried to push himself the rest of the way but got nowhere. His waistband had snagged, and the hole was barely large enough to fit him even without his clothes.

The problem would have been simple if he had the use of both hands, but even small twitches in his bad shoulder caused a dizzying amount of pain. In the end, he had to push himself back out of the hole enough to suck in his stomach while shimmying back and forth to get his pants over the lip.

Without any further resistance, he slid out of the hole and into an uncontrolled roll down the slopped cave wall until his body wedged itself into a crevice made by a stalagmite.

---

Oliver woke to the sound of dripping water.

His first thought was he desperately needed to stop passing out; it couldn't be good for his head. Close behind was the need for water.

And no, he did not care how hallucinogenic that water might be. His only concern was whether he could open his mouth at all to drink it.

His bad shoulder had wedged between the stalagmite and slopped wall of the cave. That certainly explained his latest blackout. The question was, could he extract his shoulder without passing out again?

He pondered the question for a few minutes before concluding that it didn't matter. That he needed water was an understatement, and though he wasn't sure he ever wake up if he passed out again, he knew for a fact that he'd water the sands—or the cave, as it were—with what was left of his emaciated body if he couldn't hydrate himself.

And with that lovely thought, he used his good arm to push himself out of the space he was wedged in.

Blood flowed into his shoulder and with it immense pain.

Oliver moaned on the floor of the cave while lights danced in his eyes, again. He was tempted to think fairies had taken up residence in his cornea with how they danced about.

It was hours, or minutes, or seconds—time kind of lost meaning—before he was functional enough to stand. Then it took another several minutes before he could walk.

Or stumble, as it were, down to the water's edge. A small part of his mind marveled at the sheer volume of water before him, far more than he'd ever seen or even imagined could exist. Was this a lake? A sea? An ocean? He didn't know.

The thought was instantly buried under need as he practically dumped his head beneath the liquid to partake of life itself.

Except his mouth wouldn't open. It'd been glued shut so tightly by dehydration that his muscles couldn't overcome—

His mouth tore open so painfully he was certain parts of his lips drifted in the water. But with that pain came blessed water, most of which he inhaled.

Oliver sputtered as he pushed his head out of the water. Coughs became wheezing breaths, and then without any hesitation, he stuck his head back under the water...

...where he drank. And drank. And drank.

Some distant part of his mind sounded a siren, a warning that he was going to kill himself. Water was all well and good, but only in appropriate doses. Dehydration wasn't uncommon in the out districts, and drinking too much was a well-known death sentence.

Oliver couldn't care less. The water was sweet in a way he never considered possible, enticing him to partake until his stomach was unnaturally distended.

Satiated, Oliver pushed himself out of the water and rolled over onto his back.

He felt relieved, full, happy...until nausea overcame him.

A prodigious amount of hallucinogenic water exited his mouth rather unexpectedly, emptying most of his gains back into the still pool from which they came.

That done, he rolled onto his back, took a deep breath...and fell asleep.
