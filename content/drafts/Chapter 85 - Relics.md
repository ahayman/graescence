# 85 | Relics

“Careful now.”

Stan had a look of concentration as Roland _pushed_ the tip of the sapling down between the two ‘walls’ Stan had shaped to guide it. Once they’d gotten it in place, Jonah slipped the latch around the tip to secure it. The thick end had been lashed to a nearby tree and then bent to create an arch. The latch connected to a trip-rope that would, theoretically, trigger the latch and release the sapling.

It was a simple design, and he had a reasonable hope that it would snare the sabre, but he didn’t think it would last long. Its real purpose would be the noise it made when it snapped against the tree. The greatest difficulty would be discerning where the noise came from, but he’d lived in the mountains long enough to tease out the truth from echoes.

“And that’s it.”

Jonah looked over their latest trap with satisfaction. It’d taken three days to set eight traps before they’d use every inch of rope the camp had available. The loggers grumbled about this until Jonah reassured them they’d get their rope back unharmed.

Roland thought that optimistic. Maybe they would get most of the rope back unharmed, but certainly not all. The trap might rip the leg off many creatures, but the sabre wouldn’t be caught for long. It was too strong and too fast and had claws that would shred their braided rope like wet paper.

“I don’t know... just seems really obvious,” Stan said as he looked over the contraption.

Roland looked up into a cloudy sky that was threatening to cover the ground again. “The snow should help, but you’re probably right. We couldn’t use these long before they figured it out.”

“Wait, then why did we spend three days doing this?”

Roland looked over in surprise at him. “Well, because we only need to catch one.”

Stan shrugged back at him but still managed to look pensive.

“Stan’s right,” Jonah said. “We wasted several days and all our rope to catch one creature. It’s not really a sustainable solution.”

Roland turned to him. “Then don’t go further in.”

Jonah sighed with a shake. “Not really my decision. Do the animals here really get worse further in?”

“Yes, they do, much worse. You won’t survive. The only reason I can is because I remain silent and move quickly. That’s not really an option for an entire camp of loggers.”

A light snow had started to drift down. Jonah reached out and caught a couple flakes on his hand. “I’ll talk with Alister. At this point, I don’t see how he could justify going further. There’s plenty enough Whites here to make us all rich and better that than to die to greed.”

“That might be the most reasonable thing I’ve heard this trip,” Stan said.

Jonah snorted. “That’s because you spend too much time hanging out with Fin.”

“That’s... probably true.”

Jonah looked toward the sky. “Let’s head back before it starts snowing too hard. I’m hungry and don’t fancy getting lost before dinner.”

He turned and walked toward the camp. Stan and Roland automatically fell in step behind him, and once again, Roland was struck by how easily the man commanded. He didn’t even need to say anything. He just moved, and people followed.

The snowfall picked up as they walked and began to obscure the path until they no longer saw Jonah ahead. It lent their walk an ethereal quality. Something was comforting about being surrounded by the soft kiss of winter, but it was a false comfort here, and the lack of visibility made him antsy. Roland opened his senses but found little more than the usual assortment of small creatures along with the camp ahead.

They arrived back at camp to the smell of the same stew they’d had the first day Roland arrived. It occurred to him that they must run out of the stuff soon, and so he split off from Stan to head straight for the kitchen tent.

“Ah... smart boy you are! Today the lazy shall eat bread alone,” the cook said as she spooned him a smaller portion than he’d like. He nodded his thanks and walked away with a pang of guilt. He’d not recalled her name, or perhaps he never learned it. Aside from his friends and perhaps Alister, he hadn’t really gotten to know any of the others. In truth, so many people made him uncomfortable and exposed. Perhaps that had come across, for while most of them seemed to have accepted his presence, they seemed equally happy to let him be. He had no idea if this was normal or not.

He sat down before a fire that still seemed too large to him, raging as it did against winter’s embrace, but he’d grown to like it. It was still stupid to build such a beacon here, but then the sabre unwittingly allowed them this comfort with its protection. It was the same false comfort of soft snow, and yet it was still a comfort to sit in the warmth and light while the darkness and cold were kept at bay.

“Stan said I should look at your stick.”

Roland shook himself from his fugue and gave Fin a confused look as he sat down beside him. “My what?”

“Stick, your stick.” Fin waggled his eyebrows back at him suggestively and with an eager nod. He sighed at Roland’s blank look and pointed to his back.

Roland’s eyes narrowed. “My sword, you mean?”

“Yeah, your stick.”

“Why don’t you... nevermind.” He handed his weapon over with a bit of reticence. No matter how comfortable he’d begun to feel around these people, he never let his weapons get far from his person, not even while sleeping, especially not while sleeping.

Fin looked over the weapon as he hemmed and hummed. He turned it over a few times and even swung it around a bit to the side, though he didn’t bother to get up. Finally, he gripped it and formed an edge. His eyebrows flew up as he hummed again in appreciation.

“A relic.”

“Say what?” Stan said from behind Roland, making him jump. He scowled in irritation, then sighed to himself. Why couldn’t he keep his guard up here? He’d gotten far too comfortable to allow someone to come behind him like that.

“A relic. A weapon not made by us... you know, some other civilization.”

“There are no other civilizations.”  Stan’s voice had a flat, tired tone.

“Well, not anymore.”

“This again?”

Fin shook his head in exasperation. “Do you really eat every piece of shit the Empire feeds you?”

“You can’t just discard established truth because you happen to have a pet conspiracy theory.”

“Pet? No, it _makes no sense._  One Empire over our entire history? Are you daft?”

“Daft? What... where are you getting these words?”

Fin shot him a patronizing look that Stan studiously ignored as he turned back to Roland.

“It must be some kind of new design... maybe Cardonian?”

Fin rolled his eyes as he handed the sword back to Roland. “It’s a relic. My master had one like this that he let me use on occasion. _Nobody_ can create a weapon like this anymore. A lost art,” he turned back to Stan with a look, “long lost.”

Stan gruffed out one of his irritated noises and walked away.

Roland looked to the sword a moment and then back again. “I thought it was just a normal gravtech sword.”

Fin snorted. “You think a lot is normal.”

He then fished around in his coat for something, pulled out a metal flask, poured a bit of its contents into the soup, thought for a moment, poured more, and finally capped and returned it to his coat. He sipped the soup, grimaced, stirred, sipped, and then sighed. He looked over at Roland, who had stared at him the whole time with his mouth slightly ajar. “That did not work as well as I thought it would.”

“Wha—”

“What bug crawled up Stan’s ass?” Anna sat down next to Roland, who looked over at her in surprise, though she ignored him.

That was normal, sort of. She ignored him certainly, but only when he was watching. He’d caught her staring at him often enough, though more often with a consternated expression of one trying to figure out a puzzle. Over time she’d appeared angrier, though what he was doing to earn that anger completely eluded him. He was half convinced she hated now. She’d barely spoken two words to him after their last altercation.

“I won.”

She narrowed her eyes at Fin. “You piss further or something?”

“No.”

“Make fun of his meditation again?”

“No.”

“Argument then?”

“Yep.”

“Ah... hmm... gravics?”

“Nope, the Empire argument.”

“Ah.” She nodded. “He is a bit set in his beliefs on that one.”

Fin snorted. “Only a little.”

“Sorry I missed it.”

“Oh, it’s not over.”

“No?”

Fin smiled and pointed at the weapon Roland was still holding. The motion almost caused his bowl to slip off his knees. He snatched it back before it fell, though he managed to spill a decent amount on his pants in the process. “That wooden stick the boy’s fondling is a relic,” he said absently as he picked off a piece of stew from his lap and then threw it his mouth.

Roland shot him an aggrieved look. “I was not fondling my stick.”

Fin barked out a laugh and almost dropped his bowl. Anna shook her head slowly with a perplexed look on her face.

“What?” Roland looked around in confusion.

“Your stick? You were fondling your stick?”

“I do not understand your fascination with that word.”

“Wow, really. Just how long have you been out here?”

Anna looked at Roland intently. “It’s a relic?” she said slowly.

He shrugged. “That’s what Fin believes, although Stan doesn’t think so.”

She motioned him to hand it over.

“Relics don’t exist,” Stan said firmly as he returned with... bread? Ah, he must have been one of the lazy ones the cook had referred to.

“Ran out of stew?”

He nodded ruefully as he tore off a chunk with his teeth and chewed it slowly. It did not look fresh.

“Might be better for it.” Anna gave her own stew a sour look.

Stan quickly offered his bread with a gesture. “Trade?”

She briefly considered it but then noticed he was still chewing and gently shook her head. She averted her eyes to Roland and raised an eyebrow.

Roland handed her his sword with a small sigh. It was stupid, but he felt mildly violated, handing it out like this. She took it and idly looked it over. Slowly, inch by inch, a frown grew on her face. She redoubled her efforts and began looking at it more carefully, examining it from several angles as she took in the weapon.

“It’s not a design I’ve—” She hissed and snatched back her hand suddenly.

Fin chuckled and flashed her a smile, “Got a bite to it, eh?”  Roland realized he’d been waiting for that to happen.

“What—”

“It cycles your energy back to you.”

“Why would it do that?” She looked baffled.

“Waste not, want not.”

Stan tried to speak, but it came out as little more than muffled syllables as he tried to chew the same bite he had first taken. Fin flashed him a triumphant smile.

She looked at Fin with her head cocked a moment, then over to Roland, who simply shrugged, and then back to the sword. Her eyes widened suddenly as the implications set in.

Fin nodded sagely. “*And* it can form different edges.” He flashed Stan a triumphant smile. “Know anything that can do that?” Stan studiously ignored him as he continued to chew.

“It really _is_ a relic...”

Stan scoffed, but that turned into a cough as he breathed in some of the bread. He tried to speak, but his whole mouth had gummed up. Seeing his plight, Fin cheerfully dug out his flask and offered it. Stan looked at it suspiciously, but he had few options at that point. He swallowed a big gulp to wash down the bread, then gasped, doubled over, and began coughing.

“Good stuff, yeah?”

“Gods below, Fin, you could remove paint with that.”

“Well yeah, that’s how you know it’s good.”

Anna let out an exasperated sigh and rolled her eyes as she looked over the weapon again. She shook her head and turned to Roland. “And you say your _trainer_ gave you this?”

And again, she’d emphasized the word trainer like he’d been lying to her. “Yeah...”

She scowled, clenched her jaw, and then let out a slow sign. Then she hit him.

It wasn’t an attack, not really. She’d formed no edge, and while her swing was strong, it wasn’t exactly well executed. Had she managed the hit, he’d barely have grunted. But instinct took over, and he’d moved inside her guard and disarmed her in a single motion before he’d thought about what he was doing. In the end, he stood with his sword pointed at her, and his stew spilled on the ground.

Her eyes flashed in triumph and then searched his own, looking for some unfathomable thing he couldn’t discern. They stared at each other like this for a while until she huffed and looked away.

“It’s just not possible.”

“Why? What’s the big deal?”

But she said nothing as she worked her jaw repeatedly.

“Relics like that are closely guarded within layered vaults by only the richest families,” Fin paused a moment then wagged his head, “or by masters who can defend their claim, but even then they’ve probably been loaned by some patron or another.”

Roland blinked carefully at Fin, who’d somehow managed to actually say something serious. “So?”

“So,” he said slowly, “A trainer doesn’t just _give_ a relic to a student to play with. They’re simply not handed out like that. They’re mostly inherited by rich Royal brats who maybe remove them once or twice a year to clean it. Sometimes they’re bought or stolen, and very very rarely is one just found... though it’s been hundreds of years since that’s happened.”

Anna gave a forceful nod and shot Roland a wide-eyed, brow-raised, expectant look. He returned a blank stare, and after a while, she let out another huff, turned back to her soup, and picked at it absently.

“I’m not a Royal.”

Fin snorted. “Yeah, that’s pretty obvious.”

“I’m going to see if they have something, anything else,” Stan said suddenly. He motioned to Fin with his bread, of which he’d taken a single bite. He repeated the motion and cocked his head when Fin showed no signs of moving.

Fin sighed. “Oh... right... yes, uh, let’s go exchange food... or something.” He got up and gave Stan a sour look but followed him anyway.

Roland shot the two a desperate look. Stan shrugged and pointed back at Anna before turning back and walking with Fin toward the kitchen.

Roland looked at the weapon a moment before returning it to his back. He picked up his soup from the ground and sat back down as he tried to process his thoughts. He had no idea what to say to Anna. He didn’t even understand what was wrong, and she seemed to take offense at every word he spoke. Silence seemed the wisest course.

He mused that he somehow held an ancient weapon made by some long-extinct civilization. It seemed incredible and unlikely... and about right. Rose clearly weilded something far more exquisite. He should have been surprised, but at this point, nothing about Rose surprised him anymore. She had two relics then, an incredibly unlikely coincidence. He wouldn’t be surprised in the least to find out she had more of these stashed somewhere, perhaps in the mysterious room he was forbidden from entering.

But it was yet another piece of evidence that Rose was an Elder. Yet for all his suspicions, they revealed nothing, added nothing, gave him nothing to work with. So what if she was immortal? It may explain how she was so damn good at so many things, yet it did nothing to explain why she trained him with such brutality. All he knew was that he was being shaped, honed into a weapon. Yet to what point? It all seemed so senseless.

It ate away at his soul, this not knowing.

“You let us paint your story, but you reveal almost nothing at all.”

He looked over. She’d spoken quietly as she picked at her food, of which very little had been consumed. A part of him wanted to tell her everything, but even had he felt free to do so, he very much doubted she would believe him.

“And you seem convinced I’m lying to you.”

“That’s... fair.” She released a long exhale and turned to him. “But you have to be lying to me— to us. Nothing about your training here, with a relic no less, makes _any_ sense at all.”

“So, what does?”

“Did. my. father. send you?”

“Anna, I have no idea who your father is or why he’d send— wait, did you run away?”

“See, and that’s what’s so frustrating. You are either the best liar I have ever encountered, or you’re actually telling the truth. And if you’re lying, you’re brilliant, absolutely brilliant.” She shook her head. “I mean, this lost boy routine is incredible. It’s insane, of course. Who would be dumb enough to believe something like that? Nobody survives out here on their own. But... but if someone did. If there was some boy stuck out here, trained by some mysterious master, given a _relic_, and well...” she looked at him with pleading eyes and breathed the last words, “it would be you.”

“Why can’t—”

“Because Roland, I really _need_ you to be telling the truth,” she said through clenched teeth as she squeezed his hand.

He glanced down at her hand, which covered his. He hadn’t flinched at her touch, hadn’t even noticed until she squeezed, but seeing her hand on his made his heart race, and when he looked up into her eyes, his breath caught.

“I’m not lying.” Although he spent a long minute scouring his memory to make sure that was true.

“But you’re not telling us everything.”

He frowned and turned his head away from her slightly. “I can’t.”

He dreaded that she might see too far, too clearly, and reveal too much of him only to find nothing inside. A porcelain shell covering a monster. At any time, her eyes might see this truth, and then she would reel back at the horror that was him.

She released her grip and left his hands to the cold while she went back to picking at her food.

After a few minutes, he spoke. “What happened?”

She gave a half-hearted shrug. “I ran away.”

“From your father?”

“I suppose you could say that. Although not really from dad, more like my situation. Or maybe I was running away from me,” she paused for a moment in thought, then nodded. “I didn’t like the person I was becoming, so I left to find myself.”

Roland must have had a confused look on his face, for she redoubled her explanation.

“I left my... my station or my fate, I guess, so I could forge my own. You have to understand that everything was written out for me. What I would do, who I would marry, what my life would be like, every detail. What disturbed me most was that I was _becoming_ the person everyone forced on me. And I hated it... I hated that person... I hated myself. So yeah, I guess I ran away. Or maybe I ran to find myself before everyone else defined it for me.”

“And you decided that here would be a good place to do that?” The idea of coming to the most dangerous forest in all the world to find one’s self seemed... extreme.

“No, not here,” she said with a tired sigh. “This was a fluke, a chance encounter with some woman that sold me on the adventure. I’d been working in a mercenary corps for a while and jumped at the chance for a change of pace. I was bored and stupid, and the idea of a real challenge was irresistible. I hadn’t realized it was a death sentence, and yes, I knew the rumors... I’m not used to rumors actually understating reality.”

They fell into silence for a time, each to their own thoughts. The snow had stopped and left the ground sparkling under an evening sun that peaked out from a narrow gap between the clouds and mountains. It cast the whole camp in temporary amber. It was a moment frozen in a cold fire that seemed to burn the scene into Roland’s mind.

“I hate you,” she breathed.

He froze, all of him. His breath, his heart, his body, it all just stopped.

“I’d forged my path to become my own person, someone I _liked_ for the first time in my life. And then I came to this... this hell. It stripped me of everything until all I had left was to wait for death. And then you come with all your lies—”

“I’m not lyi—”

“—*and* make me feel safe again. You make me feel hope, like we can do this.” Her jaw clenched as tears began to run down her cheek. “And it’s _just_ like your story. I’d have to be stupid to believe you, to believe we can do this. And yet I do... and I hate you. I hate you for making me believe again.”

Roland’s breath came quick. Anna had a stunned look on her face as though the last confession had been a surprise even to her.

“I...” she shook her head violently and stook up. She looked unnerved, uncertain, angry. He wanted to say something, anything that might make it better, but as usual he had nothing, no ideas, no words that would form.

She spun on her heel and headed out into the shadows toward the tents. He started to chase her a dozen times in his mind, yet that impulse refused to connect. His emotions raged a tempest of contradictions as he watched the frozen amber swallow her.
