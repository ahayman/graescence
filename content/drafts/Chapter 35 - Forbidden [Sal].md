# 35 | Forbidden [Sal]

Sal hated tents, a rather recent discovery. He'd slept for an unknown number of days, and that lack of knowledge irritated him to no end. He then followed it with more days — five, precisely — staring at tent fabric while avoiding thoughts of the past. Aside from the doctor, nobody visited him, and the doctor seemed content to say little and answer none of his questions; he didn't even know the man's name. He longed to go back to the medically induced bliss of nothing, if only to alleviate the boredom, though just the thought of miscounting more days made his teeth hurt.

On the fifth day of nothing, Anj came in a flurry of motion, bid him come, and led him outside. The sky was as glorious a blue as his enjoyment of it was brief. Anj hurried him through a series of bland brown tents only to deposit him into a larger one, where he was directed to wait, again.

He sat in the corner on a flimsy wooden chair. He sat staring at the tent fabric, the table in the center, the chair beyond it. He sat for two hours and twenty-two minutes. He sat while Anj left, came back, shuffled papers, wrote on several, and then walked out with a few, all without glancing at Sal.

Sal had to pee.

A brief glance around the tent yielded no chamber pots. He wouldn't have used it, of course; peeing in your superior's chamber pot seemed like a good way to get kicked out of the army. Still, knowledge of a chamber pot might be useful in an emergency.

So he sat, and he waited, and he stared at the table as the most interesting thing in the room. It was wooden, foldable, and on it were scattered papers. He was tempted to read the papers, one of which looked to be a map, but Anj's instructions were to sit and wait, and he was determined not to mess up his first command. Still, he arced his neck and tried to make out the map's details in the hope he might see where he was, or where his town used to be, or really anything more interesting than tent fabric.

He let out a squawk when several people burst into the tent. Anj walked over and sat in the only other chair in the tent, far side of the desk, while everyone else gathered in a half circle around it. A large man blocked Sal's view. He considered standing, but the pressure in his bladder warned him against it. He leaned instead, arm pressed down on the seat edge, which creaked dangerously.

Anj scanned the room. "We have little time." His eyes landed on the large man in front of Sal. "They said nothing, not even to you?"

The man nodded. "Sir, I met them beyond camp and escorted them direct."

"Good. Post two guards ten paces from the tent. Allow no one near, except for Ishaan and the Inquisitor."

The man nodded, snapped a crisp solute, and left, giving Sal a view of Rinley and Renee.

Rinley wore a worried frown. "Inquisitor?"

Anj turned to Renee. "Report."

She shared a glance with Rinley, but didn't repeat his question. "It's pretty much as the boy said, worse even. There's at least a fifty league radius that's unlivable. Near the center, the trees — well, everything really — is disintegrated."

"Everything?"

"Well," Rinley drew the word out, one eyebrow raised at Renee.

She took a deep breath, pressed her lips together, and let air out slowly through her nose while she worked her jaw. "Not everything."

"Lieutenant!" Anj snapped. "Leave your issues with Rin outside and report now or gods help me, I will see you cleaning latrines for a month."

Renee stiffened her back ramrod straight. "Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. It's been a long—"

Anj slapped his hand against the table. "I said _report_."

Renee flinched back as though struck, but recovered quickly.

"There are..." she closed her eyes, "some trees that were unaffected by the... whatever it was."

"Elderin," Rinley offered with a cheerful nod.

"I suppose," she growled, sparing him a brief glare before continuing. "Even the ground around them was left untouched. It was... unnatural, sir."

"The town?" Anj asked.

She shrugged. "Don't know. If there was a town, it's gone now."

"You found no one else?"

"No, sir. I can't even imagine what could have done something like this, much less how anyone survived. Frankly, I don't understand how he survived," she gestured to Sal, "much less walk all that way."

Anj nodded. "That's what I'm worried about." He grabbed a small stack of papers off the table and handed them to Rinley. "You need to sign this now."

Rinley took the papers and glanced at them. His eyes widened, went to Sal, and then back to Anj. "Right," he said slowly as he bent over the table, finger trailing over words Sal couldn't see.

"Did you get the money?"

Rinley nodded as he flipped to the next page. "I ordered the draft through Ishaan before we left." He pressed the pages down onto the table and scribbled on them, then picked them back up and flipped to the next page.

"Good."

Rinley finished, flipped through the pages again, then handed them back to Anj.

"What's going on, sir?" Renee said.

"Ishaan is stalling the Inquisitor, but we have little time to talk." Anj took a deep breath, hand on the table as though to steady himself. "Nothing I'm about to say will ever leave this room, on pain of death. Do you understand?"

Renee looked skeptical. "Pain of death?"

Rinley turned to her. "The inquisitor, Renee. If they think you've even hinted of this, they'll make sure it's the last thing you do."

Her eyes went wide. "Oh… right. Okay, pain of death. Got it."

"What you two witnessed was the aftermath of a godling."

"Oh come on, godlings are a myth created by the empire to... justify… the…" Renee's eyes shifted between Anj and Rinley, "inquisitors, right?"

"Apparently not," Anj said at the same time Rinley shook his head. Anj turned to him. "You probably know more than I do."

Rinley shrugged. "Not much. They exist, but most the Empire calls godlings are barely worth mentioning. They're lucky if they can take down a building. There are myths of true godlings, but there hasn't been one found in... well, honestly I don't know. The inquisitors are very good at keeping knowledge of them contained, probably because any Royal would sell their mother for the opportunity to get a hold of one."

All three of them turned to Sal, who suddenly forgot his need to pee. "What? I didn't do it."

"No," Anj said, "I don't believe you did, but that won't matter to the—"

A bald man with ebony skin burst into the tent, followed by Ishaan. The man was well-dressed in an expensive looking black coat, matching black pants, a form-fitting layered gray vest beneath it, and a lighter grey, almost white, shirt under that. He had angular, hollow cheeks, sharp jaw, his expression relaxed but serious, and it commanded the room. Rinley and Renee immediately made room while Ishaan placed himself far side of the tent. The inquisitor examined the group and settled on Sal. His eyes narrowed.

"Inquisitor," Anj said, "we found the boy— shit!"

The inquisitor had raised one hand against the room while his other snatched something from his coat and stabbed Sal in the chest with it. Sal looked down in horror as two wooden prongs penetrated either side of his sternum. It looked like an elegant, wooden, grilling fork. He looked up at the man, opened his mouth, and screamed.

The pain was like nothing he'd ever known, as though acid had poured into his nerves, setting them on fire. His whole body convulsed and seized. The chair broke as his body stiffened, yet the man smoothly followed Sal to the ground.

As Sal continued to scream, he realized he couldn't stop. The breath was being forced out of his lungs and once his scream died, he found his muscles locked into place, unable to draw breath. Fire came in waves, but even in the relief between them, he felt muscle tear under the strain. He couldn't move, couldn't breath, couldn't even twitch his eyes. In that moment, still looking into the man's eyes, he knew he was going to die.

Then, just as quickly, the inquisitor removed the fork and replaced it in his coat. All of Sal's muscles went flaccid, releasing the contents of his bladder. The Inquisitor pushed him over on his side while his stomach convulsed to expel his last meal.

The inquisitor let go after he started dry-heaving. He stood and dropped his other hand, which had remained outstretched against the others. A light-blue tinted glass dome began to unravel.

Renee, who had been pounding against the glass wall, dropped her hands. "What. the. fuck?"

"He's not a godling." The inquisitor said with a deep baritone that filled the room. Sal rolled onto his back and tried to focus on him, but he'd turned away to Renee and Rinley. "I take it you scouted the source?"

Rinley nodded slowly, eyes a little wild.

"Good. What did you see?"

Renee's expression turned murderous. Rinley grabbed her arm and spoke before she could do something stupid.

"We scouted the...area as best we could, pushing in over fifty leagues and—"

"_Fifty leagues?_ Are you sure? You found the source?"

"Approximately. The area had been wiped clean, but we pushed far enough to realize we'd past the center, or near enough."

The inquisitor's face seemed to pale; his breath shallowed. "Can you describe the destruction?"

"Everything within twenty leagues had disintegrated, shredded for perhaps another twenty, and beyond that, like a windstorm had torn up the trees. It was like someone set off some kind of bomb, although I've never heard of a bomb that—"

"Okay," the inquisitor threw up his hand, "I get the idea."

The Inquisitor looked back at Sal, who'd tried and failed to sit up, then back at the others. "If you have questions, now is your chance to ask them. You won't get another."

"What the fuck did you do to Sal?" Renee demanded.

A smile tugged at his lips. "The boy? He'll live, though he'll ache for days."

"What caused the destruction?" Anj said.

"A field warp, I'd say, given the radial nature of the damage."

Renee gave him a disbelieving look. "Like our shielder testing?"

"Yes, just like that."

"Field warps don't explode."

"Think of it more as a rapid expansion of a very, very strong field."

"That sounds like an explosion."

The inquisitor shrugged. "An explosion is an exothermic reaction that— you know what, sure, it was an explosion."

"But field warps don't hurt people."

"That's a hell of a lot of power," Anj said, "Is this sort of thing normal for godlings?"

"No," the inquisitor said firmly, "and I recommend you don't repeat that word again."

"Right, and so how will you contain this?"

The inquisitor sighed and reached up to rub his forehead. "It's a large area, but it's remote and there were no other villages affected. We'll keep the shipments of lumber going in the interim and redirect new orders to other lumber towns over time." He dropped his hand. "Given the severity of the event, we were lucky it happened where it did."

"Yeah, one problem," Rinley said, "that town was exporting Elderin to some Royal."

"I... doubt that."

Rinley turned to Sal. "Plague boy, what's that rhyme again?"

Sal wiped his mouth and winced at the movement. His broken arm ached fiercely. "Rhyme?"

"Yeah, the one about the tree?"

"Oh, umm… blooded in Winter, verdant in Spring, bleached bones in between."

The inquisitor gave Sal a sharp look. "You've seen an Elderin?"

Sal shrugged as best he could. "They're around."

The man snorted. "Just around, like any other tree?"

"Pretty much."

"You weren't growing them?"

"No, why would we?"

"I saw no groves," Rinley added, "but saplings wouldn't have anchored yet."

The inquisitor gave Rinley a dangerous look. "And how do you know what they look like?"

"My family has a contract with the Empire for cores."

His expression shifted to disbelief. "You're a Royal?"

"A minor one, and we keep our hands out of the bloodbath."

The inquisitor stared at him a moment, then shrugged. "I've seen odder things."

"Wait, why would the Elderin be spared?" Renee said.

"Elderin generate their own fields," Rinley said.

The inquisitor dipped his head. "They're light, almost imperceptible, but if you push against one, it'll push back."

"But a field warp?" Renee had a thoroughly confused look, as though someone had told her a boy had butchered an army with a pocket knife.

Rinley turned to her. "What do you think a shield is?"

"_Not_ a field warp?"

"Then why do you think they use them for the shielder's test?"

"Because it's just — I don't know — a way to test if you have enough power. Like, can you light this bulb? Yes? Oh good! You're in!"

Rinley's mouth worked a second. "A light bulb? Are you—"

"Light _is_ energy," the Inquisitor said. "And with enough... well, you need but look at the sun. But we digress." He turned to Anj. "The boy is coming with me."

Anj shook his head. "He's property of the army now."

"The army? He can't be more than, what, ten?"

"Thirteen," Sal mumbled, then groaned.

Anj grabbed the stack of papers that Rinley had signed and thrust them at the inquisitor. The inquisitor looked them over, clearly amused. He rubbed his finger near the bottom of the paper and looked at his thumb, blackened from wet ink. He turned it toward Rinley, his expression flat. "Really?"

"It's valid, and the money's there."

The inquisitor shook his head. "Doesn't matter."

"You can't just take the army's property." Anj stood, causing both Rinley and Renee to tense up.

The inquisitor's face turned hard. "I can. Your army belongs to the province, the province belongs to the Empire, and since I'm a hand of the Empire, I take whatever I want," his eyes shifted to Rinley, "no matter how much a Royal has paid for him."

Renee took a step toward the inquisitor. "We won't let you hurt him."

The inquisitor rolled his eyes, amused. "I want to recruit him, not kill him."

That seemed to deflate everyone else in the room except for Sal, who had watched the exchange from the ground. At those words, he tried to push himself up, but his muscles gave out halfway through the attempt.

"But I'm a soldier now," he managed from the floor.

"Recruit him?" Anj asked as he sat back down in the chair.

"Yes. He has potential, motivation, and a rather strong constitution. Few remain conscious during the testing. Excellent material to work with."

Sal looked to Anj and Rinley, but saw resignation on their faces. "No, no, I'm a soldier."

Anj shrugged, leaned back, and shook his head. "He's got the right."

Rinley stared at the papers still in the inquisitor's hand. "That was a lot of money."

The inquisitor raised the papers and gave him a wry smile. "It was an admirable attempt. I could not have allowed Sal to go free given the circumstances, but I could accept him as a permanent addition to the army under certain conditions." He tore the pages in two and turned to Ishaan in the back. "Setup an escrow return for our friend here, and I'll sign it."

As Ishaan turned to go, Anj threw up his hand. "Retrieve the doctor for us first." He look at Sal. "Maybe with a new set of clothes..." He turned to the Inquisitor, "we do still have a doctor, right?"

The inquisitor closed his eyes and let out a sigh. "Despite our reputation, we rarely resort to killing everyone first. Your doctor is fine."

Sal's eyes widened when he realized the inquisitor essentially admitted that they sometimes do kill everyone first.

"That's not as comforting as you might have intended," Anj said, mirroring Sal's thoughts.

"No, I suspect not. Now," he looked around the room, "everything said this evening is sealed. You will not speak of it to others. You will not speak of it among yourselves. You will seek no further information about what happened, nor will you attempt to enter the affected area. And, since I'm taking Sal as an initiate, he has, for all intents and purposes, died. I highly recommend you forget he ever existed."

"Promise me he'll be okay," Renee said and earned an exasperated look from both Rinley and Anj.

"He has a much better chance of surviving our training than he would a Royal sponsorship." He gave Rinley a pointed look. "We don't randomly kill our initiates for perceived slights."

Renee backed down, looking somewhat mollified.

"As I was saying, if you break any of these restrictions, and this includes Mr. Ishaan and your doctor, then I will consider you all compromised." He made eye contact with each one except Sal. "Your lives are now in each other's hands."

Silence fell over the tent as they processed the inquisitor's words. Sal tried again to push himself up, and this time managed to make it to a seated position.

"I want to be a soldier."

The inquisitor turned and raised an eyebrow, mildly surprised to see Sal sitting. "You will be."

"It's not the same."

"It's better. Soldiers make war. Inquisitors ensure peace."

Sal gave him a doubtful look, which earned him an amused smile. "You'll see."

The inquisitor turned when both the doctor and Ishaan walked in. The doctor knelt down beside Sal and began looking at his eyes. "What happened?"

"Did you bring clothes?" the inquisitor asked.

"Yes."

"Good. Clean him up and get him changed. He'll need sugar water but no food yet." The inquisitor turned to Ishaan. "You have it?"

Ishaan nodded and handed a sheet of paper to the inquisitor, who glanced over it, then knelt over the desk with a pen. The doctor had dragged Sal away from the mess and used a cloth to wipe away much of vomit, but grimaced when he saw the stain in Sal's breeches. Sal immediately blushed and turned his head away in shame. The doctor tried to tug at his shirt, but Sal snatched his arm back.

"I can do it."

The shirt was more difficult to remove than it should have been, but he rebuffed any further attempts to help. He'd just peed himself, and he refused to add any further insult to his shame. He could only imagine what his father would have done had he been there.

He removed his pants with effort but paused at his undergarments, suddenly aware that he was in a tent full of people.

"No modesty in the army, plague boy." Rinley had kind smile, but Sal was looking at Renee. She rolled her eyes and turned her back.

It took too long to undress, wipe himself down — he refused several attempts by the doctor to do it — and dress himself. His fingers had no strength, and they kept loosing their grip. His one attempt to stand ended in complete failure, and while the doctor prevented him from collapsing, he still felt very frustrated and ashamed by his weakness. That was heightened when, after finally pulling his boots on, he looked up and realized everyone in the tent was waiting for him.

"Can you stand?" the inquisitor said.

Sal nodded and tried to stand. He collapsed, pushed himself up, then collapsed again. He managed it on his third try, took a step, and then collapsed.

He'd always been good at the simple things, he could do this. He tried again, and again he collapsed. He tried two more times before he managed three shaky steps.

"I think I just figured out how he walked fifty leagues," Rinley said.

The inquisitor gave Sal a surprised look. "You walked the whole way?"

Sal nodded, but the motion caused him to loose balance and collapse again. He pulled himself up using the table and almost pulled it over on him before Anj leaned his weight on it to counter the balance.

"How did you survive the event?"

"Whitewood... I fell down a ravine and hit my head." The world wobbled and forced him to lean against the desk. He blinked several times to clear it.

"That's some luck," the Inquisitor said in a curious tone.

Ishaan walked back into the tent and handed Sal a water flask. Sal frowned, not realizing the man had left again. He opened it, tipped it to his lips, and gagged on the syrupy sweetness. He forced it down and swallowed his nausea. He would not fail another task.

The inquisitor walked up, grabbed Sal's chin, and looked into his eyes. "Good," he said after an uncomfortable moment of searching for something. "Very good. Now, let's go."

He took Sal by the elbow and led him out. Once they got to the tent flap, Sal looked back at the others, the ones who'd tried to adopt him. They all had the same look, as though they were watching him walk to his death. The inquisitor tugged. He turned to follow, only just catching Rinley silently mouth, 'good luck' before he walked out.

Sal staggered as his eyes adjusted to a setting sun just above the tents. The inquisitor led him around back and wove him through the tents toward the edge of the encampment. Sal caught snippets of conversations from within tents; but any group that saw the inquisitor either diverted or fell silent.

They arrived at the camp's version of a stable, little more than several horses tied to a rough wooden rail. As they approached, another inquisitor walked out from behind a bay horse. Sal struggled not to stare. She was the exact opposite of his inquisitor; she was thin, with pale-white skin, hollow cheeks, and blue eyes. She wore the same kind of black-gray suite that his inquisitor wore, yet hers accentuated… everything.

"Ash, this here is Sal. He is—"

"You do recall why we're here?"

The inquisitor's lips pressed together into a tight smile. "Yes. Yes, I do."

"Then why is he still alive?"

Sal took a step back, angled to hide partially behind his inquisitor. It didn't escape his notice that he was hiding behind the man who tortured him.

"He's not a godling."

Her eyes regarded Sal with doubt. "That's not the word around camp."

"And you listen to rumors now?"

"Got nothing else to do here."

"I tested him."

She leaned her head to the side to take in Sal more fully. "Clearly, not."

"You doubt me?"

She gave him a look that Sal couldn't discern. "Yes, Djrek, I do."

Djrek grunted, then turned to Sal. "She's like a fine wine. Just takes some time to appreciate."

Ash shook her head. "No, I burn the whole way down."

Djrek nodded. "More like bad whiskey, then." He turned to Sal. "Better show her your chest, unless you'd like to go through the testing again."

Sal had never raised his shirt quicker. Ash looked genuinely surprised to see the fork marks which, to Sal's surprise, were little more than pin-pricks. He would have sworn they'd done clear through his chest.

Djrek, seeing her expression, nodded sagely. She rolled her eyes and walked back to the horse.

"Fine, we've only got a few hours to get back to town," she said, then swung herself up on the horse.

Djrek walked over to a gray-white dapple and untied it. Only then did it occur to Sal that they intended to ride the beasts. He took several steps back. While he'd seen horses before, it was only ever at a distance, and only when a Royal visited, a rare occasion. He'd certainly never ridden the beasts before, and didn't intend to try now.

Djrek tried to lead his beast to Sal, but Sal kept backing up.

"Unless you want ride behind her?" Djrek gestured to Ash, who shot them a look that said it would never happen.

"Uh… I'll walk."

Ash gave Djrek a disbelieving look. "You sure you know how to use the diviner?"

"I was just as surprised."

"Uh huh." She didn't look convinced.

Djrek swung himself over the saddle and settled in. "He survived a godling and walked out of the devastation."

"Or is the godling and caused the devastation."

"I've claimed him as my initiate."

"Figures." She spurred the horse into a trot.

Djrek guided his dapple to Sal and offered a hand.

Sal took another step back.

"You don't get a choice, Sal. Up now."

Sal reluctantly allowed himself to be pulled up to sit in front of Djrek, who immediately prodded his horse into a jarring trot that made Sal wonder why anyone ever rode these things voluntarily, no matter how fast they might be. By the time they arrived in town, Sal regretted ever laying eyes on the beasts.
