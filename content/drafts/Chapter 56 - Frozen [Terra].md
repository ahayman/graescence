# 56 | Frozen [Terra]

"What, pray tell, do you think you're doing?" Terra stared, incredulous.

Her brother paused, frowned, then half-hopped over half a pace, maintaining his crouch. He began clearing the snow with his good hand, while tentatively leaning on the other for balance. His damaged shoulder wasn't completely useless, but even light movement made him flinch.

They were not far from their newly minted... home, a cave that was hidden in a cliff face. She had no idea how her brother had even spotted it. He called it a lucky find. She called it many and varied curses. Just gaining entrance required excessive excavation that reopened the wounds on her fingers and merciless ground dirt into them. This fingernails not removed by the mountain, were now split with grime buried so far underneath she despaired of ever getting them clean.

The cave itself was barely tall enough for them, and certainly not the further in they went as it tapered down into a narrow crack only a few fingers in width. The "lucky" part of the find was a constant, damp draft that came from somewhere deep within the mountain and exited the crack. It was cold, but a constant temperature unaffected by winter. Her brother tried to explain why— something about how the ground maintained heat —but honestly, she'd tuned him out after half a minute. She'd maintained doubts about their luck until she saw how that cold draft drew out the smoke from their fire.

The next morning, her brother had risen them both early to apparently begin the imminently important task of... digging through the snow. The sun had yet to break the horizon and the sky still blended deep oranges to dark blues, unobstructed by any cloud. The morning cold bit deep, so that after only a few minutes Terra found herself unconsciously wrapping her arms about herself.

"If you cannot see fit to answer a simple question, then I cannot see the sense in me standing here in the cold to watch you play in—"

"Ah, here look. See this?" He pointed at a small thistle he'd uncovered. It had several still-green bulbs, but whatever flowers may have once blossomed were long gone.

"I... see, yes. It's a plant."

"_Don't_ eat these."

She sputtered. "You've made leave of your—" Her face flattened. "Why are you digging it up?"

She watched with a kind of morbid fascination as he gingerly excavated the plant, careful not to damage it. He cleaned the roots, shaking off loose dirt, wrapped a string around the stem, secured it to his belt, stood, walked ten paces to another tree, and then began digging through the snow again.

She shook off her stupor after a few minutes, and then turned to make her way back to their semi-warm cave.

"Stay, you need to see this."

She slowly turned back. "I really don't."

"Here!" He raised another plant he'd dug up in something like triumph. "This you can eat." He frowned a second. "Well, the root needs to be roasted first, but the leaves..."

She watched in horror as he proceeded to tear off a small, fuzzy, green leaf from the plant, stick it in his mouth, and chew slowly. His face puckered a little, then he swallowed with effort and followed that with an expression that was more wince than smile.

"No." She shook her head and began to slowly back away from him.

His eyes grew hard for a second, then he shrugged.

"Starve then."

"No."

"Suite yourself."

"No no _no!_"

"Perchance then you have some other source of sustenance that we may partake of? Because if you do..." He sat back on his haunches.

"...no," she deflated.

He turned back and began digging through the snow, dismissing her. Twice she turned to walk back to the cave, and twice she forestalled herself. What was she going to do there? There was the remains of a fire, their stuff, and... nothing to do.

She watched her brother for an hour before she finally got on her hands and knees to dig through the snow.

---

Terra sat down in a cold, damp cave in front of the remains of a fire, also cold. She stared at their bountiful harvest, the result of hours and hours of back-breaking work.

Chicory leaves and root, rose hip berries, another type of orangish berry (but never _ever_ the bright red berries), a very furry plant, one bunch of wild garlic (which Ven seemed surprised and delighted to find), several nuts types, acorns, lichen, pine cones, and pine _needles_. Yes, needles. They were edible according to Ven or, at least, you could make tea with them.

Also, a whole other set of plants that Ven set aside with strict instructions to _never eat_, again, as though she were slavering at the mouth to consume raw plants.

Also, a large stick.

...and what in all the frozen, bladed hells had her brother been doing in his leisure? Terra couldn't fathom it. Yes, she could sort of understand that his "hunts" weren't actual hunts like the Royals usually did, and yes, she could grasp the basic idea of survival "training", as he called it, but never would she have equated that with scrounging around on the ground looking for random plants... for _hours_.

Even her most uncharitable ideas of what men might do without women to temper them did not— _could_ not —conceive of this. She would call it barbaric, but felt that to be an insult to actual barbarians, whom she imagined _never spent hours on their hands and knees looking for nuts._

Worse, it was barely midday. Her back ached, even as she shifted on the cave floor to relieve the pain. Ven was restarting the fire with yet another expensive graetech device whose sole purpose was to generate enough heat between two stubby prongs so as to create fire. He was using it on some kindling to restart their fire.

She didn't bother asking where he got it, bought or stolen. She preferred stolen. It was an expensive piece of tech that was, while very much within his means, also completely superfluous. One did not need to light fires when one was a Royal, much less heir to an actual Chair. She couldn't even think of where one might even start a fire. Or no, wait, candles? Mood lighting, maybe. Did he have candles?

Once the fire was lit, he walked to his pack and pulled out a _pot._ Her jaw dropped. He carried a pot in his luggage because _of course he did._

"One could perish for lack of a way to cook," he said quite reasonably upon seeing her face.

He then placed in her hands said pot. Her eyes took it in, then shifted back up to him. They narrowed.

He smiled. "We could use some water."

Terra opened her mouth to tell her brother, with all eloquence of course, exactly where he could stuff the pan, before noticing his stance. It was subtle, and he hid it well, but he wasn't balanced right. His weight was shifted almost entirely on one foot, favoring his side.

"Right, water," she groaned as she got up, feeling a worm of unease eat at her.

There was a stream about a fifteen minute walk from their current abode. It was not frozen and, according to Ven, probably never would because it was spring fed. It also meant there were fish in it but, again, according to the gospel of Ven, they would be too difficult to catch. For now.

She stared at the stream as it flowed, watching a few fish of dart about. Most were small, but there were one or two decent sized ones. She wanted to try and catch one, but while the water wasn't frozen, it certainly felt damn close. After dipping her fingers, she decided sticking an arm in would be unpleasant at best.

When she arrived at the cave, she found her brother whittling his... stick. At least, that's how she thought of it. In truth, it had been some evergreen sapling he'd randomly murdered, then stripped of its branches. Why he couldn't have simply picked up a stick off the ground, she didn't know. It's not like the forest wasn't littered with them.

"Great," he said with a smile, completely at odds with their situation, "put it in the fire and we'll at least have some food."

She turned to the fire and was surprised to find it divided. On one side it burned as usual, but he'd dragged out coals to the side. Over them, he'd erected a small tripod from which hung a bundle of the roots they'd found, cleaned and now roasting above the coals. Taking cue, she took the two sticks lying close by, and used them to pull out coals from the fire.

"Oh, to boil water you'll need more," Ven said after looking up.

Terra paused, then waited, then finally looked up, only to see he'd returned to his whittling. Annoyance flashed through her.

"Are you deliberately being obtuse?"

He glanced up, frowned, then seemed to realize something.

"Ah, apologies, but the coals aren't enough to boil water. Take two of the logs, put the coals between them, and place the pot on top. They'll funnel the heat."

He returned his attention to his stick.

She scowled at him, but then proceeded to laboriously drag two logs from the fire, difficult to do with only sticks to drag them. After placing the pot on them, she scooted back from the fire and propped herself up to watch her brother.

A dozen questions floated through her mind but she refused to voice them, if only because he was distracted and interrupting just might have him suggest she do some inane task that was nevertheless perfectly reasonable for their situation.

Ven was very carefully shaving his stick with a graetech knife. It was tricky. The knife would cut through wood as though air itself, and just an accidental twitch could ruin the project... or remove a finger. In truth, the knife was probably the worse tool to use. He'd already stripped off the bark and cut it down to about five paces— a long stick. At present, he was tapering the ends.

She had a suspicion she knew what he was doing, and while it made a kind of sense... it also didn't. Why make a bow when you had a sword that could, quite literally, cut through anything?

Also, how in all the frozen hells does he know how to make a bow?

She opened her mouth, but then thought better of it. She was tired and her back hurt and drawing attention to herself didn't seem wise. So instead, again, she watched him as he whittled. He looked content, and that was another mystery. She still couldn't recognize the person before her as her brother.

The novelty lasted all of half an hour before she grew bored. She dug around her pack for a little bit, organized her clothes, stared at her desolate hair supplies in despair, then at a journal. Leather bound, it was coupled with an expensive fountain pen clipped to the spine. Somewhere in her pack was a bottle of ink. She shouldn't have brought it but she couldn't bring herself to leave it. Her mother gifted it to her before their journey. On the inside cover she'd written, "A life unobserved is not worth living."

It was the only thing written. Terra had meant to use it but she'd always been too busy. Now? Now... she was too depressed. She didn't want to "observe" her life here. She didn't want the first words written to be ones of despair. She set it aside. She needed distraction more than introspection.

A bluish glint caught the light and drew her attention. Tucked along the edge of cave were the spines from the ice cat her brother had collected.She gathered one and sat back to examine it.

It was straight, which was surprising. She distinctly recalled them arc over the beast's back. The stalk was a kind of extruded tear-drop shape that created an edge that— she flinched back and watched blood well up on her thumb. Okay, that was stupid. She stared at the point and decided it too was probably sharp. It might make for a decent weapon if she could grip it, but there was very little she could clasp, only a couple fingers around the base where it wasn't sharp.

Perhaps if she could fit a handle? It might make for a long knife if it were strong enough. She held the two ends, careful to keep the flat in her palm, tried to flex the spine, and it... didn't. She frown, applied more pressure, but it wouldn't flex at all. Perturbed, she centered it on a rounded part of the cave floor, and put her weight on it. Finally, she jumped up and down on it, though she had to keep bent so as to not hit the ceiling.

"What, pray tell, are you doing? You look like a monkey."

Terra scowled at her brother as she picked up the spine. "It doesn't flex at all."

"Why would it?"

"Well, it's not bone."

"Hmm..." He frowned and gestured for it.

She handed it over, and he spent a couple minutes looking it over. His frown deepened. He applied it to wood and while it cut, it was hard to control the cut.

"Any ideas?" she asked.

He shook his head slowly. "None. Might make a good knife if you can fit a handle."

"Why is it straight, though?"

He screwed up his face. "How should I know?"

"You seem to have divined answers to our entire predicament so far."

He shook his head, rolling his eyes at her, then handed it back to her.

"I know how it must seem but I am not, in fact, all knowing."

He returned to his whittling, and she sat back to examine the spines. Further tests revealed it would score stone but did not see to wear down the edge. Even jamming the tip repeatedly did nothing except chip the stone itself.

She almost gave up before she had a stupid idea. Or, it would have been stupid if she hadn't seen what that animal could do. There was one substance and once substance alone that could conduct graescence. It came from a slow growing, impossibly strong tree called Elderin, which only Royals were allowed to grow, and it formed the entire basis of their technology. And it wasn't like they hadn't tried to find alternatives, but countless attempts over thousands of years had revealed only Elderin.

Still, it wouldn't hurt to try. Terra pushed graescence into the spine and gasped as the energy left her and the spine curved slightly.

"Impossible," she whispered.

Her brother looked up. "What is?"

"I can feed it graescence."

He blinked, then shrugged. "Makes sense, I suppose."

He went back to his whittling. She stared at him, aghast.

"Brother! Do you truly not grasp the import of such a material?"

"Yes, of course," he said, distracted and sounding tired, "I'm sure it could make us some untold sum of money were we not stranded on a mountain."

She scowled at him, though he hadn't looked up. That _wasn't_ what she was talking about. ... Okay, that wasn't _all_ of what she was talking about. It wasn't just the money, though; it was the potential. Elderin was a know quantity, and any possible interaction it could have with graescence had long since been documented and exploited. And Terra knew them all. She had to; an integral part of her Chair involved procuring technology for the Empire. Both she and Ven had studied it extensively. Or she did at least. Ven was well known to slack on those studies in particular.

So perhaps he hadn't grasped one very important fundamental property of Elderin: it did not change its shape willingly. The art of manipulating Elderin were jealously guarded trade secrets that even Terra knew nothing of, though she understood it was very difficult. So to see something other than Elderin not only respond to graescence, but also change it's shape? Mother would be beyond pleased; it was a game changer.

Or it would be if she could find a reliable source. De-spine'ing wild ice cats wasn't exactly ideal. Hmm, unless she could breed them? No, that was out of her reach. What she could do is learn.

She spent the rest of the day playing with the spines. She was dismayed at first that she couldn't control how the spine bent. Most graetech required no finesse, but some did, especially some weapons, and she'd trained with them. Yet no matter how she fed it, it always bent the same way. It wasn't until she'd shifted her position that she realized it was always bending in a specific direction: toward the other spines lying on the ground.

She made a lot more progress once she realized the spines interacted with each other. Point them away and they would bend toward each other. Point them parallel and they would remain so. If she angled them toward each other, they would resist the graescence she fed them, as though they interfered with each other.

Even more surprising was when she rotated their base, shifting the direction of the "edge". The spines would curl around each other, like vines twinning around a sphere. This, she felt, was where they most "wanted" to be. The spines drank up graescence and she could almost imagine they were _doing something_, like, say, forming an ice crystal and propelling it at great speed.

That didn't happen of course, and it probably never would. Yet she couldn't drive the idea out of her head.

Soon, the water was boiling and Ven had her throw in a bunch of the random ingredients they'd picked or dug up from the ground. After a while they had "dinner", possibly the most disgusting thing she'd ever consumed, barely passable as sustenance. Then, too early, she fell asleep, dreaming of ice crystal and cats that ripped off people's arms and ate them.

They passed the next three days in this fashion.

"What do you see?"

Terra stared at her brother for a moment, then turned to where he'd gestured. It was little more than snow. In fact, everything was covered in a layer snow, though perhaps only a few fingers in depth. The sky was covered by grey clouds thick enough to hide what she assumed was a rising sun. Flurries drifted both from the wind as it randomly kicked snow off branches while the sky shook out the remains of last night's storm. Muffled silence replaced the clattering of branches in the wind. It was cold, but biting.

"Footprints— or, should I say, _paw_ prints."

"Yes, excellent. These are tracks."

She worked her jaw. "And for this you once again dragged me out of our warm..." she flinched, "cave, just to show me _paw prints_. In the snow."

"Yes! We must-"

"Are you five now, that such novelties should inspire you to take leave of your senses?"

He closed his eyes and breathed out slowly through his nose, lips pinched in disappointment. It was a look she'd come to despise, especially as it came uncomfortably close to the looks she'd often given him.

"Did you then perchance enjoy the sumptuous breaking of our fast?"

She hesitated. No, she had not.

"Then perhaps you would find it agreeable for us to acquire some secondary source of sustenance."

"Secondar— you..." she blinked, suddenly realizing what this was about, "you think to use that stick you've been whittling to _hunt_!?"

"Well, of course. Why else would I make one?"

"You— you have a _relic_," she gestured at his side, "that will cut through nigh anything, a peerless, superlative weapon, and instead you want to fling sticks? Why not throw rocks while you're at it."

He shrugged, smiling. "Slings are hard to aim."

Her jaw dropped as she gasped, causing him to chuckle at her expression.

"Do not play me as fool, brother."

"I... would not! I swear," he said, laughing.

She bawled her fist and advanced, which made him laugh even harder.

"No! No! Truly!" he threw up one hand, "Listen, dear sister."

She punched each word as she spoke, "Do. Not. Dear. Sister. Me."

"Okay— ouch —listen! Okay, just stop!"

"What?" She snarled, backing off.

"You're right. This _is_ a superlative weapon—"

"Which so far you've used only to cut firewood."

He flinched. "Yes... but consider. Any food we might want to eat is faster than we are. And any... beast that might present opportunity to employ this fine weapon, we do not want to meet." The laughter fell from his face. "I'd rather not repeat the ice cat incident."

She glanced at his arm, which hung limply at his side. He hadn't moved it at all when she attacked.

"So you want to fling sticks at animals instead?"

"Unfairly put, but... yes, of a manner."

"And why must I be parcel to this farce?"

He blinked slowly at her, almost as if she said something stupid. Which she had, of course. He certainly couldn't handle a bow in his condition.

But then, neither could she, and it was unlikely that would change before they starved to death. Scrounging around in the snow and frozen dirt would only work for so long.

And yet... she had no other ideas. Nothing. Her brother wasn't wrong. They couldn't expect a nice plump deer to come trotting over that he may slay it. His sword was not for hunting. They needed the bow, and they needed someone who could wield it. Ven had the skill, presumably, but no longer the capacity. They would die before he regained use of his shoulder. It was an unsolvable puzzle under a clicking clock that stopped upon their death.

Yet he acted as though they would live.

She hated him for that. They were going to die. It wasn't even a question. Yet... he kept making her think they could survive this, _would_ survive it. But there was no way. He knew that, she knew that, but he kept doling out hope as though it were obvious. There was no desperation in him, and that made her doubt their inevitable demise.

_But they were going to die._

And he spoke like they were not.

"So tracks like these are only mildly useful," he said, conversationally. Not even in a teaching tone, but such tone that one might use to impart trivia to another.

She sniffed, shaking her head. "Of course."

"They tell us there are animals— which is good! —but this one is but a small rabbit, probably, and see how the trail meanders?"

She waited for him to continue. Then, "Oh, that wasn't rhetorical?"

"It's scavenging, so following the trail will likely be futile."

"There's a metaphor here."

He began walking away, ignoring her comment. For moment she thought she'd actually managed to offend him, but then realized he was just continuing on as though nothing was wrong. She wanted to go back and work on her project, but she'd barely made any progress since that first night and she was starting to get frustrated. At least this was different.

They wandered— it was the only appropriate term. There was no set direction, and though occasionally Ven would look about or stare closely at random twigs and branches, the result was what she would only describe as chaotic. If there was reason behind the random changes of direction, she could not see it, and after a while she lost track of where they were.

Occasionally he would make to speak, but then obviate himself at her miserable expression. It was a rare display of wisdom. She was not receptive to instruction. She was cold. The cloud cover had begun to break, and with it came a terribly dry, glacial wind that bit deep into her bones. She ached, her feet hurt— _everything_ hurt. The dry irritated her wounds, and walking aggravated them further. Her finger tips tingled.

It took them maybe an hour before they came across something useful. Larger tracks of some kind of forked, hoofed animal that seemed to... bound in a clear direction. Ven smiled when he saw it, too obviously pleased. Terra just desperately hoped this would end soon.

It did not.

"Ah perfect! Exactly what we need."

His pace quickened. They spent another hour following the trail of an animal that was quite likely...

"Why are we following some animal that has clearly long since passed?"

Ven glanced back at her. "We're looking for a... hmmm, a road of sorts."

Her eyes widened. "Oh! A road! Of course, how silly of me. Not only do the beasts in this forest wield graescence, but they also pave roads now." Her face flattened. "I should have known."

"Perhaps 'road' is a poor choice of word. But most animals do not like to travel through brush and snow anymore than we do. So they tend to follow established paths."

She hesitated. "You think to find game along such a path?"

"Of course."

"And then what? We freeze to death waiting for some animal to unwittingly trot by us so that we may fling sticks at it?"

"What? No, of course not."

Her fists clenched. "Brother, I am done with this farce. Speak plainly now or I am done with you." Never mind that she had no idea where she was or even the general direction of their cave.

His eyes flashed and he snapped. "Oh but only if I could! Yet you snip back my every word. Cast doubt on my very aspirations. You rage at me, sister— I can see it your face, in your every motion. Petulance the likes of which could teach a five year old the true the meaning of a tantrum."

"_You dare!_", she hissed.

"Am I wrong? Truly, can you look upon your own deeds and judge them as anything but petty irascibility?"

"You! ...you," she snarled, resisting the urge to stomp her foot, if only barely. "Damn you... damn you to all the frozen hells!"

"Yes, very good, sister." He turned and walked away, following the same trail, dismissing her like some child.

She stood there, watching him, her eyes wide, jaw clenched. She _wanted_ to rage, to curse, to scream, to kick, to... but gods below had Ven neatly snipped that at the root. She knew she was being unreasonable. None of this was Ven's fault, but that knowledge sat abstract and distant, a cold star far removed from her glowering rage.

She followed her brother after a time, though distantly. She didn't want to be near him, but neither could she just wander the forest alone and she had no idea where they were.

After a time, another hour perhaps, or more. She wasn't sure, but the sun was a quarter way up and the sky had cleared completely before they'd come across the 'road'.

In truth there were no tracks except the ones they followed, which angled sharply at a path she could barely make out. The only sign of it was a slight thinning of the snow along with a mild embankment along the edges. She would have missed it had Ven not pointed it out.

"So what now, _dear brother?_ Shall we freeze while—" she cut herself off at his exasperated expression, took a breath, and modulated her tone to remove the venom. "I'm cold and wet and angry, brother, and I apologize. I should not take it out on you."

He gave her a tight smile and nodded. "We are not to wait and freeze. Instead," his smile turned genuine and his eyes flashed, "we set traps!"

"...traps?"

"Yes! Watch."

And she did. He walked the path, occasionally pulling down on a branch until he found one he liked, and then he set up his trap. He first dug into the snow and literally cut out a hole from the frozen earth. Into it he wedged a crude stake he'd whittled back at their cave. He took thick string, tied it around the branch and then a wood latch, also whittled. The branch was pulled down and then latched to the stake. He then used the rest of the string to form a loose noose, which he propped up around eye level above the trail using branches.

"You see?" he said.

"I believe so. Our ah... prey, will walk through the noose and pull on the trap?"

"Hmm," he nodded, "and the branch will tighten the noose."

"Surely that won't kill it?"

"No, that's what the bow is for."

She frowned. "Why not the sword?"

"Most animals will not willingly tighten a noose around their own throat unless they are threatened."

"So you aim to hit them from afar. Otherwise, they might bolt and—"

"—and break our trap."

She nodded slowly, frowning. There was logic here, hope, and again she felt it bubbling. At least, she did until she remember that neither of them could fire a bow. But... but it was better. It was _something_, and she watched without comment as he laid out three more traps before he ran out of string.

They would check the traps each day, perhaps even twice a day. She protested firmly that _he_ would be checking the traps— she had no intention of walking hours each way, every day. But then they stumbled onto their cave— or she stumbled, he just walked in like he knew it was there. It'd been perhaps half of an hour, less at a brisk walk.

"What?" he smirked, "you think I want to walk hours each day?"

She growled something incomprehensible at him and stomped her way into the cave. She had a project to work on, and she didn't like the way he'd been swaying on his feet.

---

"Pull back on the—"

"Yes, brother, I know how a bow works. As complicated a machinery it may be, alas, I've divined its beguiling nature to work out— stand up you fool!"

Ven jerked upright from where he'd been leaning against a tree. He swayed a little, then steadied himself. He blinked at her twice before his eyes cleared.

"It's... it's not..." he blinked again. "It is how you pull that matters."

He took the bow from her and positioned it in his hand as though to draw it, then stared at it. Terra snatched the bow out is his hand and drew the string back, arrow notched.

"Yes, of course. Very complicated," she said as she sighted her target.

"No, not like that—"

But she'd released the arrow already. And the moment it flew free she knew it would fly quite free of its target, which at present was little more than the knot of a tree fifty paces from her.

"_As_ I was saying," Ven bent over carefully and removed another rough hewn arrow from the snow, another product of his whittling, "it matters not how strong you are if you draw improperly. Your arm will shake, even if just a little, and you will find your arrow flying wide."

"Yes, please. Tell me more about how this primitive device you carved requires such sophisticated execution."

"Sister, you know I would not—"

"Yes, yes, I know. Fine. Let is continue this farce."

He looked hurt but she was too angry to care. He swayed again, then leaned back against the tree.

"Stand up!" she hissed at him.

He jerked off the tree, again. He looked lost for a second before his eyes cleared.

"Right. Well, you see, it's all in the back."

He looked as though he wanted to take the bow again, but decided against it. Instead, he rose his arm as though he had a bow, then tried to raise his other, as though to draw it. But he couldn't. His shoulder wouldn't work properly, wouldn't raise his arm like it should. Frustration flashed across his face, but smoothed out a moment later.

"You see, you draw with your arm, then lock in place with your back." He tried to move in demonstration, failed. "If you keep your elbow out, you can align it with your back. This way it won't shake."

Terra raised a skeptical brow. His arm was shaking quite terribly despite not pulling anything at all. She stared at him until he was forced to drop his arm. Frustration flashed again and he opened his mouth, but she turned away.

She drew the bow back, this time rotating her back in what she hoped was the method he'd tried to intimate.

"Yes, better. Sort of..."

She ignored him, sighting her target again. He was right. With her back holding the strain, she could take a little more time to aim. He arm still shook, and again her aim... was still wide. She rolled her eyes.

"I do not see how you think to expect I will master such a crude weapon within any reasonable time frame."

Silence.

She turned, then dropped the bow.

"Ven? Ven!"

He was slumped against the tree. She dropped the bow and rushed over to him. His eyes were unfocused, dazed. He was sweating.

"No no. Stand up you fool!"

He didn't respond.

"Up I said! Ven! Stand up!" she backed away slowly, shaking her head, suddenly feeling light. "No! No. nonononono. Stand up. Ven. Stand up! Stand up!" She began to pace. "You cannot do this. You must stand up. Stand up. Stand up standup standup standupstandupstandupstandupstandupstandup."

She turned suddenly and screamed, "_Stand up!_".

Her voice echoed through the mountains as she fell to her knees. He didn't move, didn't even flinch. She stared at him, willing him to move, watching his chest move slowly, feeling hope leach from her until she was empty, until...

She got up slowly. He was still alive. He _had_ to live. She swallowed her panic, hooked her arms under his shoulder, and began to laboriously drag him through the snow. It took an hour to pull him to their cave.

---

His wounds has festered. But of course they had. She should had known— she _had_ known. That poultice, or whatever he'd made from random plants, wasn't enough. Why would it be? She should have made him... no, she should have... she didn't _know_ what to do. There were ways to treat a wound so it wouldn't fester but she didn't know them. All she could do is clean it.

She boiled water from frozen snow and cut a rag from her clothes. He was feverish, sweating, and he groaned while she cleaned his wounds. They were red, infected, hot to the touch. But they weren't _black_. That was good. It had to be.

She wrapped him up, unwilling to let him shiver in the cave, even by the fire, but uncertain if it was the right thing to do. She made a soup and fed it to him. He drank it, but never opened his eyes.

When he was done, and she had nothing else she could think to do, she sat down, put her head between her legs, and cried silently.

It came that night.

She should have expected it, would have had she thought to consider how she'd screamed. Instead, she'd cried and cried until there was nothing left inside her. And then, to her horror, she grew bored.

Her brother was slowly dying and she was... bored. It was absurd mockery, but it was still was. She had nothing to do.

No. She had something to do, and it was distraction. She couldn't sleep, so she worked on her project as the fire's embers slowly died.

She had started to drift to toward sleep when a familiar sound registered as a thing out of place. It was just the crunch of snow. Familiar and not at all threatening unless you considered that it should not be.

Her eyes snapped, darting between the barest of shadows cast by the last light of the fire's embers. She saw nothing and, slowly, her heart began to slow. Her mind almost convinced her it was a dream.

Until she saw the eyes staring back at her. Feline, slitted, narrow. They move slowly as a beast stalked forward, revealing patterns of white and black fur. Powerful jaws, bared teeth, a low growl felt more than heard.

Her fingers wrapped around the spines still at her side, drawing blood from her fingers. She moved slowly, drawing her feet beneath her, and positioned herself between it and her brother.

She waited.

The cat stalked around the fire, it's body looking both relaxed and ready. It watched her, wary but intent. Terra shifted her feet, ready to lunge.

She'd thought she could lunge, perhaps get under it, or dodge to the side. She hadn't realized just how _fast_ it could moved. She'd barely even engaged her muscles before the cat was on her. The only thing that saved her was her own surprised, instinctual reaction to raise her hands, bringing the spines between her throat and the beast's jaw.

It flinched as one bit into its jowls. The other spine she stabbed into it's neck. The animal drew back but she'd fed the spines graescence and they'd curved.

It tried to lunge at her again, but the spines wouldn't let it reach her. She kept twisting them, hoping to damage something critical.

Finally, it jumped back, rendering it's own flesh to get away, almost yanking the spines from her fingers.

It was hurt and bleeding. She could see it was in pain, and she expected it to leave. Her breath came quick and shallow; arms were shaking; she lowered them.

It lunged at her again.

She couldn't bring her hands up in time. Jaws wrapped around her throat even as she felt her spines enter its ribs. She felt teeth puncture her skin, tearing into her muscle.

She _pushed_ everything into those spines, twisting them, driving them deeper even as death tore at her throat.

Something left her. A flood of graescence.

The cat froze. It twitched once, then collapsed on top of her.

Seconds bled into eternity. She slowly let go of the spines and placed them on jaws whose teeth were still in her neck.

She very carefully pried the cat's jaws open.

She tried to push it off her but it was _heavy_. A different kind of panic burned, releasing a flood of adrenaline. She screamed and pushed until it rolled off.

She scrambled way and pressed her back into the cave, staring at it, waiting. She couldn't convince herself it was dead; she couldn't understand how. She couldn't believe. It was faking and soon it jump up to finish the job.

She waited and minutes passed, but the monster didn't move, didn't even twitch.

She couldn't know how long she stayed there, staring at. Eventually, she came to herself and the rational imposed itself on reality.

Slowly, as quietly as she could manage, she crawled towards it. It didn't breath, didn't move, didn't twitch. And when she put her hand on it, instead of the warm body of a freshly dead animal, she found it was...

...frozen solid.
