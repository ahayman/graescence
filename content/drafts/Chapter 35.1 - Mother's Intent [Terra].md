# 35 | Mother's Intent [Terra]

Terraria va Belcia knelt on a knee before her mother, head down, eyes firmly fixed on the marble beneath her. Her eyed traced grains of gold through the stone while footsteps echoed through the rapidly emptying room. Her lips moved rapidly, repeating over and over the phrases she'd memorized for this meeting. Everything had to go perfectly.

Her brother's life depended on it.

The doors closed with a boom that always seemed unnaturally loud to her as it echoed around the pillars and through the room. It had to have been designed that way; doors don't just boom like that.

As the sound cleared, it left a stifling silence, also intentional. Terra's lips stopped moving, afraid to disturb the quiet before her mother's pleasure allowed her to rise. Any breach of protocol would ruin everything.

The silence stretched. Terra closed her eyes. It was not a good a sign.

A sigh echoed through the room. Terra winced. Her mother knew exactly why she was here.

"Rise." Her mother's voice came out impatient, as though addressing a child who'd tracked in mud.

As she pushed off the floor to stand, her eyes trailed along the gold in the stone. While it looked like a natural part of the marble up close, it branched out at unnatural angles, often running contrary to the marble's natural grain.

Terra didn't need to see where it led to know that the gold would trace the seal of her house: a humble merchant's sled inlaid in gold with such skill that it appeared part of the floor for all to walk over.

It was an irony she did not dwell on.

The seal was perfectly centered among two rows of decorative columns that rose several stories, stopping short of domed roof of matching white marble. The roof was supported by a dozen wooden arcs carved into intricate patterns, looking far too thin to support the weight of so much marble. They would be had they not been made of Elderin.

Between them there was nothing, leaving the room seemingly exposed to the elements, and giving an incredible view of the clouds beyond and the distant mountains below. Both the perspective and the apparent lack of walls were a lie. Look closely at the wooden arcs, and a slight blue-tinted haze betrayed the graescent glass protecting the room. Behind her, the other spires could be seen. And walking to the edge would give one an excellent view of the upper city splayed out beneath them.

Beyond the seal was a half circle dais, upon which was _not_ a throne, but a large chair of gold-gilded wood. Only Emperors sat on a throne, but a house needed a _chair_ upon which its head could render judgement. Nobody said what that chair could look like.

Age lines had gracefully etched the ebony skin around her mother's very impatient looking eyes. Silky black hair framed a heart shaped face. Her mother was a known beauty in her day. Still was, if the unceasing and rather stubborn line of suitors were any indication over the years. Fifteen years of polite rejections, and they still made the attempt.

She was dressed in a dark green double-breasted coat styled to highlight her figure. Gold filigree lined the edges, along with an embroidered version of the house seal above her left breast. Polished wooden buttons lined each side, glinting a telltale red that hinted of their Elderin origin. She'd let it open to reveal a pistachio colored silk shirt beneath, which must have happened during the silence—her mother would never appear as anything but perfect in front of others.

She leaned on an elbow, hand raised to her lips, while crossing her legs. The black pants followed muscular legs to a pair of elegant black boots.

"Mother," Terra said as she curtsied respectfully, "I thank you for taking the time to meet—"

"Please tell me you're not here to plead a case for that fop you call a brother."

"I..." Terra took a breath to steady herself. "I know you've settled on a decision, mother, but seeing as you've not yet—"

"Twice now you've pleaded his case, and twice now he's made a fool of himself and this house." She leaned forward. "I do not suffer fools."

"I realize that, mother, but—"
