# 8 | Insidious Hope [Dia]

"Oh niiice," Malek said as he pushed in past Dia.

Dia closed her eyes and let the others pass. It was a good find. Really it was. A very good room to find except...

_No Inscriber._

She swallowed her disappointment and took in the room. A variety of desks scattered about the edges, with one long table in the center. Each desk boasted structural Elderin beneath a thick layer of dust, evident only because they stood at all. She kicked the nearest table leg.

_Who in all the frozen hells needs tables that last thousands of years? What's even the point?_

She shook her head, annoyed at herself for being annoyed. It's not like she could expect to find an Inscriber with how rare they were. But it was hard not to hope with how deep they were delving. If there was ever a chance to find an Inscriber, it would be here...

_Except clearly it's not, and I'm just a petulant kid that refuses to eat candy because I can't get the flavor I want._

"Alright, no more pity parties," she said to herself after a few seconds of scowling at a piece of wood, "let's see what we've got."

She walked slowly past the others, pretending to peruse the room while trying to ignore the feeling of Tait's eyes drilling her back. He believed her now, and she'd never regretted such satisfying vindication so much.

_He's going to blab, I know it._ She didn't want to be disappeared by the government to do what? She didn't know. Experiment on her? Force her to make things? No, keep her from making anything; that's what she feared.

They could _force_ me to delve.

She turned to look at a desk on the far side of the room and caught Tait averting his gaze from her.

There was one only piece of tech that truly interested her, but it resided at the table Malek had approached. She doubted he would find it given its size. Malek observed only the obvious. She was tempted to head straight there even so. The tech called to her.

She continued on instead, plucking pieces of tech hidden beneath the dust, leaving the obvious pieces for others to grab. Much of it was mundane, if perfection could ever be mundane. Yet nothing truly extraordinary. Pens, small platforms, clips, and a whole lot of structured dust she suspected was once paper.

"Ooooo."

Dia glanced over to see Kalina holding up a long sheet of paper, a faint hint of ruddy reflected in the light.

Hemp, and they'd used it as paper. Even the idea of it felt obscene, like using money to wipe your ass. Worse, it hadn't worked. The paper survived just fine, of course, but whatever was written on it had long since faded away.

_And that's the important part._

One of the more interesting pieces was a series of different sized rings—medium, large, then small—joined together by three slivers of elderin cores that wrapped around like scaffolding. They formed what looked like a lensless spy glass with a bulging middle. Each ring created a contained field warp within it and...she had no idea why.

A weakness of her gift; just because she knew how a thing worked, didn't mean she know how to use it. Didn't stop her from stuffing it into her pack, though. Nor any of the others scattered about.

Looking around, she caught Tait staring at her.

Her face flattened, eyes narrowing. "What?"

He turned back around quickly to closely examine the very complicated graetech pen—

_Yes Tait, it's just a pen._

She rolled her eyes at his back and walked to the table Malek had already checked to grab the graetech he missed.

It was easy to miss. Beneath a thin layer of dust was an even thinner slate of graetech, barely the thickness of two or three pieces of paper. Yet it was by far the most impressive piece of graetech she'd ever seen and except for a glint of red, it looked just like a random piece of wood, not even a graetech at first glance.

_Gods,_ she peered closer at it, _there must be millions of reservoirs, and connected to... what? Thousands? No, hundreds of thousands of miniscule field shapers._

This was by far the most valuable piece of graetech she'd even encountered. It might just be the most valuable find any delver had made. It was possibly the most valuable piece ever made.

_Well, maybe not as valuable as an Inscriber, buuuut..._

Dia lifted her head and looked around carefully.

_I, Dia, hereby amend our unstated contract to assign to my person as my... ah... loot, alone, not only any Inscriber we encounter, but also this... thingy here,_ she waved the slate at her teammates' back. _Do I hear any objections? No? Okay, I guess it's mine then. Yay!_

She carefully slipped the slate into her pack, laying it vertical between one of the dividers where it would be hard to detect.

_Not that I'm trying to be sneaky, seeing as nobody objected to my new... ah acquisition, but perhaps it's better not to tempt anyone to steal it._

Because here was the thing. She _knew_ what it did. She couldn't conceive of how a thing like this could be made, but she did _know_ what it was. A treasure worth a million graetech pieces, worth a forest of Elderin, worth a kingdom, worth a whole empire.

A book.

_No, not just a book. Books, plural. Thousands of them. Maybe even more than that? I dunno. A frickin lot of books, all stored in a single piece of thin wood. A whole goddamn pocket library. And let me ask you a question, Dia. Can I do that? Yes? Great! Well then, lemme ask you this one very, very important question: What kind of books would be stored in a place that researches graetech? Can you take a guess, Dia? Hmm? No, well lemme give you a hint: I'll slit my own wrists if it's filled with romance novels. That's all I'm saying._

"Are...you talking to yourself," Tait interrupted.

"No!" Dia's head jerked, only now realizing she'd kind of been aimlessly walking around the room in a daze. "Of course not."

She glared at him, then realized he was still analyzing the exact same pen as before.

"It's just a _pen_, Tait," she said, snatching it out of his hand and sticking it in her pack.

"They are worth a lot," Moore offered from the other side of the room.

"Whatever. He's been staring at it for five minutes." Dia said as she walked over to a new table and snatched another pen off it.

_Or staring at me._

"See, pen." She waved it around, "How you feed it determines the ink flow—" she shook it a couple times, frowning, "or it would if there were ink."

"I know what a pen does," Tait said defensively.

"That's it guys," she said, turning from him while packing up the second pen. "We got everything."

She felt a stab of guilt at how quickly everyone except Tait abandoned their search. They trusted her, and not just in her ability, but her. Perhaps...perhaps they had no choice. Her talent gave her an insurmountable advantage here. And yet they did trust her, and she'd just stolen from them something...

_...that governments would kill them for. I'm doing them a favor. And it's not like they hadn't taken pieces of graetech for themselves. Malek is not giving up that hotplate and Kalina has that stupid comb of hers and Moore...hasn't actually taken anything. Damn you, Moore._

She bit her lip, but she absolutely wasn't giving up her slate thingy.

_Need to come up with a better name for it though..._

"Just like that?" Tait looked around at them, confused. "We only just started searching the room!"

"Hmm, you'll learn," Moore said as he walked by Tait with a knowing look, "...or not."

Tait watched them all file out of the room, taking his light with them. He fist clenched repeatedly as he watched them.

"Are you really just going to just pout alone in the dark?" Kalina spoke without looking back.

Tait growled something that none of them could make out. A sharp yell followed. He appeared a few seconds later, cursing and rubbing his shin.

Dia stared at the next trap. Everyone else had taken note of the general area she'd been looking at and was making damn sure they weren't standing anywhere near it.

Tait stopped rubbing his shin to find Dia staring at him, arm outstretched.

"Gravity thingy please."

"Do you call everything 'thingy'?" Tait handed over the cylindrical device, one side flattened so it wouldn't roll around.

Dia ignored the question and immediately handed the device to Malek.

"Ah, come on. You're the one—"

"I did the last one."

"Fine, then Kalina—"

"Nope, I'm the light bearer."

Malek's face flattened. "Trade you."

"Hmm, lemme think..." She tapped her foot. "nope."

His face fell. He looked at Moore with a pleading expression. "Help a bro out?"

Moore slowly shook his head.

"Fine," Malek sighed, defeated, then looked at Dia. "Where?"

"Oh, about two paces that way— no No NO NO!"

"Wha wha what!?" Malek froze his leg half way through a step, his chest hyperventilating.

"Oh... ah, no, never mind. You're fine."

"DIA!"

"Just another step." Dia said, trying desperately not to laugh.

"What is _wrong_ with you!?"

"Maybe just a small step."

Malek put his foot down and waited almost half a minute for his breathing to slow. Then he crouched down.

"You know it's like three paces—"

"I'm doing it here," he growled.

"Okay, but not like that. You want the end facing you."

Malek hesitated, turning the cylinder over in his hand. "Which one?"

"Either. It's just the direction of the tunnel—Tait, stop staring at me."

"I'm not."

"I can feel you staring at me. Stop it; it's annoying."

"Alright," Malek said over her, "here goes nothing."

He placed his finger on a divot, concentrating. After a few more seconds, he shifted his hand so both his thumb and finger were on each divot, opposite ends of the cylinder. About twenty seconds later, he rocked back on his butt, breathing hard. The gravity thingy generated a visual distortion of space, outlining the tunnel it created.

"Gods, it takes a lot." He blinked repeatedly.

Dia snorted. "I know, right? But you still gotta put it in the trap and...ah, I wouldn't touch the distortion."

"Yeah yeah."

Malek shifted onto all fours and began carefully pushing the sphere forward.

"Okay, that's good," Dia said after he'd triggered the trap. "Oh...ah, we need to move. That won't last longer than a couple minutes."

Malek immediately crawled through, careful not to disturb the device as he crawled over it. Tait was right behind him, followed by Kalina, then Moore. Dia was the last one through. Instead of climbing over it, she pushed it with her until she was clear of the trap. She waited only a few more seconds before the tunnel dissipated.

_Ugh, these things don't last long._

She stood, feeling a little shaken, and walked to the next door on the opposite wall of the previous one.

"Please oh master lock thief—" Malek began.

"Shut it," Dia snapped, her eyes rolling.

She stared at the lock. It was the same four by four panel and, like before, she new the code length and the sections used. This time there were no dual entries, which made it harder for her, ironically. She began entering combinations, trying to logically work her way through each possibility sequentially.

It took about ten minutes before she unlocked the door. She immediately walked in without alerting the others.

_Ten pens, four recessed lights with no power, and... no Inscriber, of course._

She closed her eyes, and let anger and disappointment wash over her. Delving was a stupid thing to do, and she was a stupid girl to think she could find one. It had been hundreds of years since an Inscriber has last been found. She was being ridiculous; she knew that. She knew it, and yet she still that insidious hope kept worming into her, driving her to keep trying.

By the time the others had realized the door was open, Dia had already collected the pens. She met them at the door.

"Just a clerical room," she said with more than a hint of bitterness. "Here."

She shoved the hand full of pens toward them. Malek grabbed a few and walked away to lean against a wall. Moore and Kalina split the rest. It didn't matter. They would split the haul later.

Tait stared a Dia with a deeply suspicious frown.

"You can go search if you want," she gestured to the room behind her, "but you'll find nothing else."

He walked into the room and looked around, but most of it was hidden by Dia's shadow. He glanced at Kalina, who was back in the hall holding his light. His face flashed frustration.

"Whatever," he said after a few moments, shaking his head as he walked back out of the room.

"What's the next trap again?"

"Nothing we can disable," Dia said, looking at the third door with longing.

_Wait wait wait. The door's trapped?_ Her eyes widened as hope renewed its assault on her heart.

"I doubt that." Tait shook his pack. "What's the trap do?"

_That must mean it's protecting something important._

"Kills you," she replied absently, still staring at the door.

_But I don't know the trap. How can I know the door is trapped, but not what the trap is?_

"Oh! Of course, it kills you. Why didn't I figure that out?"

Dia turned to glare at the sarcastic little shit. Then huffed out her annoyance.

"It scrambles your brain, okay. You got something for that?"

_But there is a trap. I know there's a trap. Where's the gods forsaken trap!_

"Um, err... what? No?" He opened his pack and peered in, but seemed at a loss. "How does it... do that?"

"Dia, you okay?" Kalina asked, looking at her with concern.

"I'm fine," she snapped while glaring at the door. "It pulses out a weird field warp that creates tiny little vortexes which tears apart your brain."

_But it should be easy to disrupt._

"Ohh...kay?" He stared at his bag, looking even more lost, "I don't think I've got anything for— oh, wait, what about a shield?"

Dia blinked, thought for a second, then shook her head. "No, it'd go right through..."

It was a quirk of shields. They acted like solid objects. They would hold off most anything up to and including full size warps if they were strong enough. A field warp, though, would pass right through, just like it would any other solid object. Usually this wouldn't be a problem given how little an undirected field warp can do anything.

"Alright, I'm calling crush," Kalina said.

"What!? No! Ah come on!" Malek glared at her, "_I'm_ calling crush."

"Don't be a child."

"Fine, you wanna call crush? You get this."

He picked up the gravity cylinder and thrust it at her.

_Oh gods... I see it now._

Kalina pursed her lips at device, but took it with an eye roll after a couple seconds.

_The hall trap_ is _the door trap. How could I miss that?_

"I am so stupid," Dia said into the silence.

Everyone turned to her.

Kalina's lips twitched. "Dear, we try not use that word when we talk about you."

Dia's brow twitched. "You... try?"

Kalina shrugged, her face innocent. "Nobody's perfect."

Dia left her mouth open for a moment before deciding, or perhaps realizing, she'd completely walked into it and anything she said would only dig her a deeper hole.

She turned back to the door and took a step.

"I'm going to try something—"

"Stupid?"

"...yeah..."

_Easy to disrupt. All you need is something to disrupt it._

"...monumentally stupid..."

She stopped just outside the range of the trap which she now realized was closer to the door than the other traps.

_Ugh... so obvious now._

"Please don't die?" Kalina's voice was small and worried.

"...don't plan on it," Dia said, distracted.

_Okay, so I've read about this. It's not easy, but it is simple. You just need to..._

She raised her hand, something that was supposed to make the process easier, and fed her graescence into an imaginary device.

Nothing happened, of course. There was no device to feed, nowhere for her graescence to go.

She pressed harder, feeling the resistance in the palm of her hand, the strain throughout her body. Sweat beaded her forehead as she pressed harder and harder. It felt as though she were trying to feed a stone wall. Nothing was there; nothing happened; no visible distortion...

_But most people can't do that anyway._

She might as well been constipated, for all the satisfaction she was getting.

Her light gutted out.

"Dia? Please come back."

_Is it working?_

She was pressing as hard as she could, but she couldn't _see_ anything. It made her doubt. She was being stupid. Really, really stupid.

_Oh gods, please work, please work, please work..._

She took a step forward.

The trap triggered and washed over her.

Dia blinked.

"I'm alive?"

She blinked again.

"Ha! I'm alive!!!"

"Dia!?"

"Oh shit! I'm still alive!" She giggled, then she heard a noise behind her. "No, wait! Stay there. Just hold on!"

_It shouldn't trigger again. Shouldn't..._

She kept pressing her imaginary field warp and took another step.

Nothing.

Another step.

Nothing.

_Okay, so it only triggers once..._

She walked to the door and—

"Don't come closer!" she shouted at Kalina, who'd taken a couple steps toward her. "It will trigger again!"

_Maybe. Probably._ She's need to stand there for a while to figure it out.

Kalina froze, panic on her face, her eyes darting between Dia and... everything. She looked on the verge of tears.

"I'm fine, Kalina. Just stay there. Trust me, I need to do this..."

For a moment, she almost thought Kalina would come anyway, but the girl stopped herself. Kalina jerked her head into a nod while the light in her hand brightened, perhaps unconsciously. Her eyes promised endless pain if Dia did something stupid enough to get herself killed.

_She's gonna kill me anyway._  Kalina was not happy. Dia gave her a small smile and turned to the door.

_Now for the hard part._

She took in the requirements for the passcode and grimaced. She stored her light in her pack, relying on Kalina's light instead. She entered the first five parts of the passcode, took a breath, raised her hand toward the trap, pushed a field warp that she still couldn't see, and then submitted the last part of the code.

The trap pulsed.

She let go of the field warp and sighed.

_This is going to crush._

She tried again. The trap pulsed again. And again, and again, and again...

It felt like an eternity before she found the right combination. Pulse after pulse, wrong code after wrong code, all of it had worn her down to the very edges of exhaustion. She wavered on her feet, her mouth filled with salt and copper. She wiped at her face and found blood.

She pushed the door open, took four steps in, collapsed to the ground, and began to cry.
