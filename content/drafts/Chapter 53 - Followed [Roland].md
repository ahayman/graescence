# 53 | Followed [Roland]

Roland woke with a moan, then a gasp. The gasp degraded into uneven, rapid breathing as his mind cast about in confusion. Morning light streamed in, casting stone in burning colors.

He stared colors as they slowly drifted down the wall. His mind was heavy with fog, and slowly processed was he saw. He was in a cave. Why was he in a cave?

The question faded as pain burned back the fog. His leg felt afire. He looked down, only to see something eating his leg.

He choked out horror, kicked at the thing, and scrambled further back into the cave until his back slammed the cold wall.

The monster sat up— it didn't follow. Roland stared at it with wide eyes. Its head was cocked as it absently licked its chops. A Jackret, but it... was just sitting there.

Roland tore his eyes away from the thing to look down. His pant leg was ripped and tattered, and underneath were deep puncture marks in his leg.

Memories crashed into him with flashes of rain, thunder, teeth, and pain. The desperation behind a flailing weapon clawed up his stomach and into his heart. His head dropped into his hands as he moaned and tried to chase the images away.

It took time for him to calm and separate himself from memory. He was alive. He'd survived. He'd done it.

He looked up at the Jackret. Well, he'd mostly done it.

The Jackret was staring at him. It hadn't lunged, growled, or even moved, aside from its tongue, which lolled in a rhythmic beat to its breath.

It wasn't attacking. It was fine. He made to hold his breath but let it go immediately when the world started tilting. So he controlled his breath and slowly calmed himself down.

Alive.

He repeated the word to himself, over and over. And whatever the Jackret wanted, it wasn't attacking him, wasn't eating him...

That wasn't right. His brow furrowed. He shifted his attention to the leg. He was wounded, yes, but as bad as his leg looked, the wounds were not new. If anything, they appeared clean.

A motion drew his eyes back to the Jackret, who'd lowered its head and approached him. He shuddered as it drew near and instinctually reached for a sword that wasn't there. He patted the ground desperately, but he couldn't look away from the approaching beast.

Yet it approached him meekly, almost fearful. He couldn't understand, but he stopped patting the ground.

It reached him, sniffed him twice, turned three times around, and then plopped down beside him, its back pressed warmly against his thigh.

That warmth. It felt so familiar.

He exhaled a confused breath and tried to wrap his head around it all. "You... you kept me warm but... but why?"

It raised its head and looked at him for a moment, then lay its head back down. He closed his eyes and tried to think, but as the surge of adrenaline faded, his body replaced it with pain.

It wasn't just his leg. All of him hurt, a lot.

He examined himself as carefully as he could. His leg was torn but not broken. It would hurt like hell, but he should be able to walk. That was good; that was really good. He would otherwise have no way home and Rose... well, he had no idea what she would do if he didn't return. A part of him couldn't believe she would come for him or, if she did, that she would do anything at all to help. Part of him wondered if she would find him, if only to take back her stolen sword and leave.

Whatever, he didn't care.

His left shoulder was a tattered ruin, but it had far less blood on it than he thought it should. His right forearm still had teeth and part of a jaw embedded in it. Branching veins of red fire pulsed out from the wound, and any attempt to move his hand ignited that fire through his arm. He really should remove it, but even the idea made him nauseous.

His other arm also had punctures and tears, but it didn't look nearly as bad as it felt, and the shoulder was likewise wounded but clean.

They all were, in fact. All his wounds were clean.

The Jackret hadn't been trying to eat his leg. It had been _licking_ his wounds. Obvious in retrospect, but the why eluded him.

He looked back at the Jackret, who'd settled into a relaxed rest, head in paws as it looked idly around.

Roland had killed its entire pack, all slaughtered but one. In return, it had saved his life by cleaning his wounds and keeping him warm.

Confusion warred with guilt, then pain forced it all from his mind. He needed something for the pain or he wouldn't be able to think straight before long, if he even was now. He had Rose's poultice in his sack, somewhere. It would help numb the pain.

He cast his eyes in search of the sack, which he spotted outside the alcove, near the edge of the cliff base and surrounded by pieces of slaughtered animals. Most of the blood had run away, but flies and a few birds were already taking to the meat. The pack looked to have settled on a rock, though he had no memory of putting it there. The flap was still closed, which he hoped meant it stayed dry.

Spots clouded his eyes when he stood. He staggered, wavered, tilted, then recovered enough to avoid planting his face on the stone floor. Dizziness forced his eyes closed and his back against the wall until the world righted itself.

He limped over to his sack slowly, pleased that while his leg hurt, he was still ambulant. It might take him all day to get home, but at least he could get home, provided he could stay vertical.

His stomach turned at the scent of blood. At his approach, both birds and flies took flight. While the birds sought to flee the invader, too many of the flies came at him. He repeatedly waved them off in a futile gesture that cleared the air for seconds at a time.

It was too warm. The rain should have brought the cold, but it didn't. He couldn't remember that ever happening in Autumn; always the rain brought cold. It shouldn't even be Autumn— the days were too short for that —yet it almost felt like Spring, or perhaps Autumn refused to abdicate her thrown to Winter, and yesterday a great battle had been fought above even as he'd waged his own against the beasts invading his valley. And perhaps Spring had organized a coup while the other two were distracted, slipping in to take a throne that was not yet hers to take. Would Autumn and Winter now band together in an unlikely alliance fated to usurp the usurper?

Perhaps he should stop thinking about it.

He carefully leaned over, winced as the change in blood pressure brought about a new wave of pain, and pulled the sack up by its strap. The strap was severed cleanly. He stared at it, then realized he'd done it with his sword. He shook his head in frustration. He really should be more careful with that thing.

Speaking of... he cast his gaze around for his sword and found it lying in the dirt a few paces away. It had dried mud caked on it, but otherwise looked okay, not that he would expect otherwise; the thing was all but indestructible. He wasn't sure he could lean over again without passing out, so he shuffled his way back to the alcove. The sword would do just fine for a moment... or ten.

He rummaged through his bag until he found bandages and wraps, along with a jar near the bottom with a foul-smelling substance he quickly identified at antiseptic. He applied the poultice to his arms, his shoulders, and his leg. He wrapped his leg first and then tried his shoulder, but it proved an impossible task with his only workable hand attached to it. The very attempt caused more damage than the wrap would help, so he soon gave up.

He leaned back against the wall, closed his eyes, and waited for the poultice to take effect.

---

Roland woke up shivering. The Jackret once again pressed against him, but its warmth wasn't nearly enough. Outside, the sun beat down an invitation that called to him. Why Spring decided to war with Winter, he didn't know, but he was grateful.

Or perhaps Autumn was trying to go backwards into to Summer?

Summer... oh, he missed summer. He was _so_ cold.

The pain was better; he could do this. He replaced the top to the jar, then paused— he'd used half the jar? He stared at the Jackret suspiciously, but it didn't look to have moved and he couldn't imagine eating the substance. But then, who knew what fun things Jackrets ate.

No, that wasn't fair. He shook his head. For all he knew, they only ate fresh meat. He stared at the Jackret for a moment then decided this train of thought was idiotic.

He tied off the severed strap, returned his supplies, secured it to his person, and stood.

Too quick! Light folded, twisted, wavered, the world tilted, then righted itself.

Nope, he was fine. He would make it. He had to make it. There was no other choice. Necessity made for fine motivation.

He limped out to the sword and very carefully bent over to pick it up. Darkness chased specs of light inside his eyes as he stood back up. The world wobbled again, or wavered... or something very "w" like; he squeezed his eyes shut until it went away. He really should stop bending over.

He formed a brief edge on the weapon that caused the caked mud to flake off. It was so easy. Anger surged. Now it was simple; _now_ it was easy. Everything would have turned out better if he could have kept that damned edge in place.

He grit his teeth as he stared at the stupid weapon. Then he felt like a fool. He pushed down the anger; it would do him no good. It wasn't the damn sword's fault; it was his, his alone. The handle was still dirty, but he needed to find a stream anyway.

Oh, water. He needed water. He should find some.

He replaced his sword in a loop in his harness, and then walked through a flurry of both small and large, winged creatures. This time, many more bird took flight, circled, and then came back almost immediately behind him. They were getting braver now with their numbers. He briefly considered striking them down with his sword, but was just the anger talking, and it was stupid. He probably couldn't hit a bear standing still in his current state.

Also — he stared long at them as they settled — those weren't birds.

Wait.

He'd forgotten something. It pulled at him, forced him to stop, and turn around. The Jackret watched him from within the alcove. Right, he was supposed to kill them all, but just the idea of killing it made his gut clench.

Did it matter? He'd had his vengeance, and it cost that one its pack. Was that fair? It didn't seem fair. Why should they have had to die because of his nightmares?

If it had died, he wouldn't be having these thoughts. If it had died, he probably would have died too.

He turned and to limped away. If it were smart, it would start a new pack somewhere else, somewhere not in this valley.

But it bothered him. Why had the Jackret not killed him? It certainly could have. He'd barely managed to crawl back to the alcove, much less able to defend himself from such an beast. Instead, it had curled up next to him as though he were one of its pack mates.

And it had whimpered.

He recalled the sound. It pierced his mind toward the end. It had whimpered, but why? He hadn't hurt it. Was it sad? Could such vicious animals even be sad? For that matter, could they know mercy? He'd killed every single one of its pack, only to find it regarding him as one of its own. Is that how the Jackrets worked, packs and alphas killing off each other, members switching sides to the victor?

Why did this bother him so much?

It's not like he had a responsibility to the thing. He turned to look back, but he was far down the path and saw no sign of it. He'd abandoned it to the alcove, surrounded by its dead pack mates and carrion eaters.

He ground his teeth. No, he owed it nothing. His destiny was to rid the valley of these things. If anything, he should go back and kill it.

He stared back for another moment, then turned and limped down the path again in the same direction as before.

Why had it saved his life? And why did he now feel so beholden to it?

A snap of a twig flung him out of his reverie. He clumsily and painfully withdrew his sword in a motion that was not smooth, formed an edge, and looked into the woods, ready for anything.

He snorted out a derisive sound.

He could barely walk, much less defend against a bunny. Not that the rabbits here weren't intimidating, but ready was probably not the best word to describe his state.

His eyes cast around; the very motion left him feeling dizzy.

Walk; he needed to keep walking. That was important, really important.

His shoulder tickled and drew his attention. Ah, it had opened again. He snorted. Where was a Jackret when you needed one? The snort turned into a giggle. He required a Jackret to lick his wounds, or he might die. He laughed, and it felt far better than it should.

Walk. Right, he needed to walk. He giggled. A stream to walk to, that's what he needed.

He walked, but something pulled at his arm. He looked down at the stupid sword in his hand. Ah, he should put that up. Rose would not appreciate him dragging it through the dirt. He laughed, giggled again, formed an edge, and scarred the earth deeply as he dragged the weapon deep through both dirt and stone. So easy now, the edge formed no problem now that he was bleeding to death.

The Jackret had licked his wounds clean.

Did its saliva have clotting attributes? He flinched at the idea of it eating his clots. Disgusting monster... yet it had saved his life.

Why couldn't he let this go?

What if he had woken up and decided to kill it? It had slept next to him. That implies trust, but it was trust he didn't earn. Why would something like a Jackret ever choose to sleep next to its pack's killer? Jackrets were cruel animals who hunted and taunted their prey. They didn't lick your wounds clean and keep you warm at night.

He stopped and looked down in confusion at the stream before him. He glanced up at the sky to see the sun well into its journey. Odd but he couldn't recall walking so long.

But it was good, right? He'd been walking. Walking was important. How long had he walked? He couldn't tell, couldn't remember. His mind blurred everything together in fragments with no continuity.

Something trickled and dribbled and tinkled at his ears. The sound pulled him down to stare at a stream.

When had he gotten to a stream? No, that wasn't right. He'd been standing here before... or now. Did it matter? Time seemed to have fled reason.

The water grabbed the light and danced with it. The light warped and formed, broke apart, then rejoined, all to the tune of a trickle or tinkle or... It pulled at him as it danced, laughed a light-hearted invitation that unfocused his eyes. It pulled at his eyelids.

The tune was invaded, destroyed by a rhythmic sound. He shook his head, turned, and felt astonishment. The Jackret stood next to him, head down as it lapped up water with not a care in the world. How... no, wait, not how, but why? That was the question, wasn't it. Why.

It finished its incessant, loud lapping, then turned to stare at him. It offered no answers in its eyes.

He stared down at his arm and remembered the jaw still embedded in it. It looked like it should hurt but all he felt was numb. That was probably a bad sign. He really should remove that, but it didn't seem to bother him so much anymore.

He knelt and heard a loud crack as his knees struck rock. His eyes focused in and out on the water again for a time before he felt a nudge. He looked back over at the Jackret, who looked at him curiously.

He shook his head. Stupid animal.

He leaned over and thrust his arm into the stream. He sucked in air through his teeth as the cold assaulted his arm and sent endless pin-pricks of pain coursing into the wound. The water was icy cold... literally, it had ice in it. He stared absently as a piece of ice drifted down stream. How there was still ice so late in spring was beyond him.

Wait, Spring? No, it was Autumn, right?

But it should be Winter.

He nodded. Right. So the ice made sense, cause it felt like Spring but it should be Winter. Winter meant ice.

Why was he so hot?

He left his arm immersed until it was numb, and then he left it in longer to be certain. After a few minutes, he removed his arm and began to carefully remove the jaw. He was meticulous and careful as he removed the jaw and teeth by curving them back. The last thing he wanted to do was cause more damage. As it was, he only half expected to regain full use of his hand.

The pain was intense and deep, but it brought clarity to the world he hadn't realized was missing. As soon as he had the jaw removed, he thrust his hand back into the water and allowed the cold to eat away his pain.

Once the pain reduced to manageable levels, he tried to slowly move his fingers. They did. He felt intense relief at that; no severed tendons. Now all that was left was to bandage himself up.

He reapplied the poultice and replaced the bandage on his leg and shoulder with his newly liberated hand, though he had to dunk it back into the stream whenever the pain was too much. He finished with the last of the wrap around his forearm. The sun had almost trekked half its journey across the sky when he finished.

He almost rose before he remembered his sword, then panicked. Where— oh, next to him. He dropped it. He really should keep track of something so expensive. He pushed it off the rock and watched it plummet to the bottom as clumps of dried mud slowly dissolved into the water.

Huh, graetech did not float.

That was probably good; he could not have caught it had it floated down stream. And it made sense. Graetech was heavy, really heavy, like heavier than iron heavy. But it was also wood, and shouldn't wood float in the water?

Water. That's right. He needed to drink— how had he forgotten? He was so hot. When had he last had anything at all?

He was already on his knees, so he simply tumbled forward onto his stomach, and dunked his head into the water. The rocks were warm and felt good, even though he burning up inside. But the water was cold, dousing the fire inside him or, at least diminishing it a little.

It was quite pleasant, and once done, he grabbed his sword, pushed himself up with his good hand, and rolled over onto his back.

---

Something rough and wet scraped his face.

He woke with a start, sat up slowly, and gave the Jackret a languid, aggrieved look. He was so tired, and sleep sang such sweet lullabies, and yet the horrid animal seemed intent on denying him that pleasure.

He froze at the Jackret's shadow. It had moved since he last saw it. He tracked the sun and frowned in confusion. It must be afternoon now, which made no sense at all. He looked again at the Jackret in suspicion.

No, the stupid beast was right. He needed to get up; he needed to get home. He'd forgotten the most important thing was to walk.

Home. He was not going home. He had no home. But he needed to get there anyway.

He rose and wavered on his feet. Spots blossomed on the edges of his vision as he struggled to remain upright, and twice he almost fell over while waiting for them to recede. Only when the last one fled did he begin to limp his way in the general direction of... home.

The valley didn't have any real river, but instead a system of streams that spider-webbed throughout. Even in late spring all of the streams would be active from the snowmelt, feeding into a central stream that Roland called a river, though that was a generous term. In truth, it was broader than it was deep and he could cross it while wetting only his legs.

Except it wasn't spring. It was just acting like spring, even though there was ice in the water and it rained yesterday and _why was he so hot_?

A stream also ran behind his home. He needed to but follow this one until it merged, then follow that one upstream to his house. The quicker route was to cut through the forest. But the stream was simple... and easy. Simple was important, as was easy. He didn't think he would survive anything else.

His knees kept striking stone, forcing him to climb back to his feet. Then his feet and legs were wet. He looked back but saw nothing of the stream that had merged into this one. He didn't recall crossing it; he didn't recall getting up.

And again, the sun had moved too much. He looked over in suspicion at the Jackret, but it merely panted in the heat.

He felt envy that it should feel heat while he felt so cold inside. And hot, he was also hot. It made no sense. He should sleep. His body required it, demanded it. He tried to sit down but fell back when the Jackret growled at him. He glared back, but its growl only grew louder.

He sighed, pushed himself up, waited for the spots to clear, and started walking again. Stupid, ignorant animal. He just needed sleep.

The evening sun cast shades of orange, but that surely wasn't right. Suns took time in their journey across the sky. They didn't skip around like this one did.

The thought bore a worm that burrowed into his stomach. It wrapped around and tightened with every step. He was angry suddenly, and afraid. He didn't know why.

The worm tightened its grip. There was nothing to fear. He tried to push it down, but the worm refused to leave. He tried to reason with it, but that made it worse. He would be home soon. What had he to fear? Rose? He'd completed his task.

The world rocked back and forth. Something pressed against his leg. He'd stopped walking at some point, but he couldn't remember when.

It felt like all he ever did was try to remember.

So what difference did it make if he walked or not? It didn't seem important anymore. The sun would set, and he would sleep. The pressure increased, and he looked down.

The Jackret. He scowled at the creature. His scowl shifted to a frown as dread sharpened to point. The Jackret. It needed to die.

No, it needed to run away.

Yes, that was it, and it was really important.

"Go away." His voice came out scratchy and harsh, barely more than a whisper.

The Jackret looked back, opened its mouth, and lolled its tongue. But it sat, so he walked.

The Jackret followed him.

He stopped and stared at it. It wasn't supposed to be here. He'd told it to go away.

He tried to swallow, but there was nothing. His mouth had turned to paper. He worked it until he had just enough spit, and swallowed.

"She'll kill you." His voice barely came out as a rasp.

The Jackret sat again.

He walked again, but the creature stood and followed.

"No no." He shook his head, which made the world careen back and forth. He blinked it away.

"You can't come with me. You... you just can't. Please."

The Jackret sat again, it's tongue lolled to the side. He glared at it a moment before turning to walk.

The sun had set, and the air became cool enough to make him shiver. He desperately missed its warmth. It seemed gone too soon. Suns were supposed to take a long time in the sky, but this one had skipped through the day in an hour.

He tried to wrap his arms around himself but found he couldn't. He stared at his bandages a moment in confusion. When had that happened?

The Jackret sat next to him, and he felt his anger flare.

"No! No, you _must_ go. Go. Go go GO!" His voice sounded distant, shrill, and weak. His breath came rapid and shallow.

The Jackret stared at him.

He kicked it, but it barely registered the hit. Tears stained his face and dripped onto the rocks beneath him.

He knelt, shivered, and almost collapsed. He threw a stone at the Jackret and felt his shoulder tear. It dodged the rock easily and then sat.

"Stupid animal! She'll kill you. Don't you understand! She'll. kill. you."

He threw another rock with his other hand and felt his forearm tear. It let out a sharp yelp and ran back from him a little before it turned around and sat. He sobbed tears that ran free down his face.

"She'll take you apart. Run... please, just run."

The Jackret began to approach him with its head down.

He picked up another rock and threw it at the Jackret. It dodged this one easily but took another few steps back.

"Please go."

He threw another rock, and then another, each one tearing a part of him asunder.

"Go..."

Another rock.

"Go."

And another.

"Go." He screamed a whisper.

At last, he picked up a rock, and it rolled back on his hand, tearing his wound open further before hitting the ground with a small crack.

"Go," he whispered.

The Jackret must run, must hide, must stay far away from her. He rasped at it to run.

He was on his knees. He couldn't keep the sobs from wracking his body, nor the tears from soaking the ground.

A delightful irony; his mouth was still so dry.

The stars revealed themselves, and the weeping slowly shifted into shivers. Though sleep dragged at his consciousness, he couldn't find a way to succumb. The cold seemed to penetrate everything and kept even oblivion at bay.

"I'm telling you, I heard something."

His head jerked; he knew that voice, but he couldn't remember where.

He lifted his head from the ground but found no Jackret. It would live. He found a spark of hope in that. It was enough, just enough warmth.

He tried to stand up, made it to his knees, then collapsed.

"Dear sister," it still amazed Roland how a term of endearment could sound like a curse, "it's night, it's cold, we've been out here for hours and we've walked this stream twice now. Clearly, the boy ran away and... did that rock just move?".

Roland collapsed again after barely lifting his head.

"No!"

The sound of footsteps grew large in Roland's mind. He mumbled something about quiet and sleep but they didn't listen. Someone turned him over on his back.

Fingers explored his wounds, yielding sharp stabs of pain that made him whimper.

"This is bad," Terra's voice penetrated the darkness.

Terra. Roland tried to smile, but his face wasn't working at the moment.

"I agree. We should get Master Yeng."

"And leave him here!?"

Terra's voice lilted up in... concern? Yes, that was it. She was concerned for him. The idea floated on the surface of the cold as a spark of warmth within him.

"I don't see what else we can do."

"Pick him up under the shoulders. I'll take the legs," she snapped out.

Silence followed, and for a moment he thought they'd left. He was fine with that; it might allow him to sleep. He wanted to roll back over, but for some reason the thought just never connected with his body.

"Ven."

"Do you see what weapon he carries?"

"_Ven._"

"Okay, you stay with the boy and I'll get Master Yeng."

"Ven, you stu—!"

"Fine! ...fine."

Rough hands dug under his shoulders, sending sharp knives into his nerves. Roland gasped and jerked against the pain. An expletive exploded above his head, then was followed by a light feeling as his shoulders were suddenly freed. He floated for a second before his head cracked into ground and finally _finally_ gifted him sleep.

---

He floated, rocking gently beneath labored breathing. His shoulders ached and his head was pressed forward at an uncomfortable angle.

"I... do not... understand what you see in the— mother's tits, the boy is heavier than he looks."

"Language, _Ven_!" Terra grunted. "And no, you wouldn't, would you?"

"And what, pray tell... do you mean by that?"

"You rarely see beyond yourself," she snapped out.

Oddly, he didn't respond, leaving their breaths to fill the night.

"You wound me," he said after at time.

"I... no, that was not fair. I apologize, brother; it was... uncalled for. Even I did not grasp at first..."

---

He jerked as something pressed into his neck.

"Alive, but his pulse is weak. Where?"

"We found him by the river, not but a ten minute minute walk from here."

"Hmm..."

Fingers began to poke and prod him. Then they ripped off his skin. He tried to scream and barely managed a gasp.

"His wounds?"

Silence, then outrage. "It wasn't me! What— I don't have claws. How would I inflict such lacerations?"

"He wasn't blaming you, Ven."

"I more would like to know what caused this, and I believe you've hunted before?"

"Oh... ah, well clearly not a boar. I might suggest wolves but like none I know of— and those bite marks aren't... right. Too large, and with those canines... no, if they were wolves, they were obscene monstrosities."

"Hmmm... yes."

"Your thoughts, Master Yeng?"

"Now's not the time—" he whispered, then his voice became louder. "Ah, Lady Rose."

Silence, and for a moment Roland could feel her disapproval as she inspected him.

"Bring him into the house."

"I'm not sure his wounds would bear—"

"He'll be fine. Bring him now."

Hesitation filled the silence, but there was no doubt her command would be obeyed. Roland tried to open his eyes but even that was beyond him. It didn't matter. He knew her and she would already be walking toward the house, expecting obedience. A few seconds later he was lifted, aggravating his wounds and sending a flood of darkness back upon him.

---

Roland screamed and thrashed as acid poured into his wounds and seared his veins.

"Dead gods!"

"Hold him down."

"Ven, his feet. Terra, take his arm. I'll take his—"

"Got hi— ooff. Damn he's strong."

Just as the pain became tolerable, Rose began scrubbing. Roland's body jerked of it's own accord. His scream cracked and stuttered to his breath, degrading into ragged gasps. His mind skipped and blacked out, only to be dragged back by the pain.

"Roland, I'm so sorry." Terra's voice pleaded. A hand brushed at his hair. "The wounds must be cleaned and... and I'm sorry—"

"Do we not have poppy, whiskey, _anything_?" Ven had laid across Roland's legs, bracing them against the table.

The cleaning paused. "Wine, but we'd drown him while his wounds festered."

"Barbaric."

The cleaning continued as Rose callously dug out any trace of dirt from his shoulders.

---

"Did you kill them all?"

Roland's eyes fluttered open. He blinked the sleep and blur from his eyes, and looked around his room. He felt hot and his eyelids were made of lead. Pieces of the previous night drifted in, but they felt distant, smothered by the wool in his head.

Rose stood by the window, watching him. One hand rest on lightly on the dresser— or no, not the dresser itself but the hilt of a weapon that lay atop it.

Possessiveness churned his stomach. He's earned that sword, bled for it. He tried to sit up but a wave of dizziness forced him back. He squeezed his eyes shut as a wave of exhaustion flowed over him.

"Yes," he lied.

His mind drifted for a time, until he forced his eyes open lest he fall back asleep.

Rose was still watching him. He met her eyes, but as usual, her face betrayed nothing. Without another word she turned and swept out of the room.

He stared at the door, then sighed. Whatever. He didn't care what she thought. Yet, as sleep began to drag him back into its embrace, his eyes alighted on the dresser.

She'd left his sword.

---

"What attacked you, pray tell?" Ven's tone held the usual strained politeness, but softened into a muttering. "Those wounds were made by nothing I know. Punctured straight _through_ the forearm? Canines? No. Boar? Maybe if you'd jumped on it. But how then the rendering of flesh so. Boars do not have claws."

He was pacing, at least by the sound of it. Roland didn't bother opening his eyes. His fever battled the pain of torn flesh for attention. He wanted to moan, but maybe Ven would go away if he kept still.

"None of it makes sense. This... school," Ven could hardly get out the word, "led by one of the greatest martial artist of our time, teaching only fou— three students and a peasant in the middle of— _where_ are we?" The pacing stopped and Roland tried to keep absolutely still, "If it weren't for that desert orb in our skies, I might just think she'd taken us to another world altogether. The mountains, though. Teres? Andes? Could be further south... or north. Damn that woman!"

There was an itch in one of his wounds. It hurt, throbbed, begging him to move.

The pacing began again.

"And you, clearly a peasant, no matter how you've been taught. Can't get rid of that smell. Yet... taught by none other than Master Yeng. Absurd. You've not the breeding to serve him... and yet," a huff of air through the nose, then the pacing paused again, "you should have died."

The pacing began yet again.

"I have seen fatal wounds far less than what you bore. As much as it pains me, Master Yeng has clearly developed some form of affection toward you, but—"

Both pacing and words ceased abruptly. A moment of silence was followed by the swoosh of quick steps and the sound of wood scraping wood.

Roland knew exactly what the other boy had picked up. Ignoring his pain, Roland sat up. A wave of vertigo and nausea washed over him, but he refused to lie back down. His eyes were on Ven, who'd picked up his sword.

The other boy's face held a mix of horror, fear, anger, and confusion as he stared at the weapon. Whether alerted by instinct or sound, Ven turned to see Roland staring at him. Ven flinched at Roland's appearance, but held his gaze.

Ven's lips curled. "How do you posses this?"

Roland said nothing. He was mostly just trying to stay concious, but he would not lie down until Ven released his sword.

Ven glared at him, then seemed to come to himself. His expression smoothed into a mask. He lay the sword back on the desk and stiffly walked out of the room.

Roland was asleep before his head hit the pillow.

---

The smell of roasted meat and vegetables forcefully reminded Roland that he hadn't had real food in days. How many days, he wasn't sure, but it had definitely been days. Broth had been his fare, and while it had been true he'd been too nauseous to take down anything else, that truth had clearly expired.

"You need to eat," Terra said as she walked in with a plate of some kind of fried red meat and—

It didn't matter. Roland was stuffing his face the moment the food came within reach, completely without regard to the delicacies whipped up by his captor. And it _was_ her cooking; there was no mistaking the heavily spiced _everything_.

Terra looked amused. "I see you have your appetite back. This is good, though perhaps you might slow down for the sake of your stomach?"

Roland glanced up, then shook his head and mumbled through his food. "Uh uh."

Within a scant few minutes, he'd cleaned the plate. He held it up to her, looking expectant.

"Truly?" She stared at the empty plate, her mouth slightly ajar. "I... well, okay."

If she was insulted by her relegation of her role to servant, essentially shuttling the food from the kitchen to Roland's room, she showed no sign of it. Instead, her face held a quiet fascination as he plowed through the second plate, then on to a third. He was strongly tempted to ask for a fourth, but his stomach was feeling a bit stretched, perhaps even dangerously so. Yet... he was still hungry.

Perhaps he could sneak down to the kitchen later.

Terra took the third empty plate with something like awe and carefully placed it on the dresser. Her eyes paused on the sword and her head dipped in thought. She stepped back, picked up the chair from in front of his desk on the other side of the room, and set it beside his bed.

"Are you feeling better?"

Roland shrugged. The motion shifted his stomach, forcing air up his throat. He kept his mouth closed, and tried to conceal the burp. Her lips twitched up.

After a moment she spoke. "I do not mean to be indelicate, but may I ask you a few questions about what happened?"

Roland shrugged again, this time without burping. He was feeling better. Yes, he still hurt and quite a lot if he thought about it, but he could shove the pain down and ignore it, mostly. More importantly, he'd done it; he'd killed the Jackrets and he'd suffered no nightmares since then. Of course, he dreamt nothing at all that he could recall, but it was still a win.

She glanced at the sword. "I take you did not attempt to run away? Ven had been certain you had, and even Master Yeng seemed uncertain."

Hurt flickered across his face. "No! I ah... no, I had a problem I needed to take care of."

Her brow lifted. "A problem?" Her eyes lingered on the bandages around his shoulder. "And your 'problem' fought back?"

"Mmm hmm." His stomach growled, or gurgled. It was quite loud, and drew both their attention. He poked at it, wondering when he could eat again.

"My brother is quite wroth with the situation."

Roland looked up, frowned, and mouthed the word 'wroth'. It was something Sal would have said, and for just a moment he had the urge to make fun of her for it. He squashed it quickly, though— she didn't seem the type to appreciate good humor.

"I will admit," she said after seeing his look, "his irritation is naught over concern for you, but it is the unknowing that has earned his ire."

Roland blinked. "Unknowing?"

"Hmm. We know not where we are, nor can we divine the nature or origin of this Lady Rose. Master Yeng we know, of course, and were it not for that I would think my brother would turn quite violent, I'm afraid. Even I have felt patience wear thin. Yet, this was... tolerable, if not ideal. But your absence, followed by wounds of a nature my brother, nor I, nor even Master Yeng could discern? I fear we've crossed a threshold, a breaking point if you will. And your Lady Rose offers nothing in the way of explanation or assurance. She is quite silent on the matter, insufferably so."

She wasn't _his_ Lady Rose. He was just as much a captive as they were, but... but somehow it hurt. They didn't want to be here; _Terra_ didn't want to be here. It shouldn't hurt because _he_ didn't want to be here either, but he also had no place to go and so this prison had somehow become home. And they didn't want to stay. It was childish and stupid, but he couldn't stop from feeling hurt, like they were rejecting him. And yes, they, even Ven and the ever quiet Ashter, who mostly kept to himself.

Terra was waiting and she was still a friend. She cared, or so he thought. He hope she did, anyway.

"Jackrets," he mumbled.

"Jackrets? An animal of some sort?"

"They're kind of like... wolves I guess?"

"Wolves cannot effect wounds of that nature."

Roland grunted. "I said they're like wolves, kind of, but worse... a lot worse."

"Care to elaborate?"

"Well, they have long teeth? I mean, you can see them with their mouth closed... so..."

"Long teeth? Canines, perhaps?"

He blinked at her. "Sure?"

"Is that all?"

"No, they have sharp claws. And long! And sharp. Oh and ah, more on their... umm..." He pointed half way up his forearm.

"They have claws on their... elbows?"

"Well, they're really curved, like umm..." It occurred to Roland that he might be bad at describing animals.

"Talons?"

"Yeah! Talons."

"Wolves with large canines and talons?" She frowned in thought. "Perhaps for larger prey."

"Yeah, that's what I thought, but they don't mind hunting me."

She looked up sharply.

"Oh, and they send out scouts. I feel like they shouldn't do that."

She shook her head. "No, wolves do that too."

"Really?"

"Hmm, they're smart hunters."

"And they yip."

Her brow lifted. "_Yip?_"

"Yeah, yip. Like... umm... yip. Or, YIP. Ah no. How about _yip!_. No, not that either." He tried a few more times with out actually saying the word but he couldn't quite capture the sheer terror.

"Okay, thank you for the demonstration. So they make yipping sounds then."

"Yeah," Roland sighed, discouraged that he couldn't convey the most terrifying aspect of the beasts. Just the memory of those yips made him shudder.

"So, a Jackret is a kind of wolf with oversized canines, long and sharp claws, and a set of talons."

"And they yip."

She dipped her head, lips pressed. "And they yip."

"Oh! And they can deflect graescence."

Terra blinked slowly. "Could I impose on you to say that again?"

"They can make, like, shields I think? Or not really a shield, not like a shielder does anyway. But it's shield like?"

"Roland, animals cannot manipulate graescence in that way."

"Oh no, they definitely can; I've seen it. Everything around here can, I think. The bunnies have horns, demon rabbits. They ah, fly toward the Whitewoods."

Terra opened her mouth, paused, then closed it. She paused, thought, opened her mouth again, then aborted her second attempt. She tried one more time before she gave up and sat back in the chair. Roland nodded. What else could you say about bunnies with horns?

"If this Jackret is so so terrible, why then seek it out?" Her eyes narrowed. "Did Lady Rose send you?"

"Them, not it. Them," definitely more than one. A lot more, "and no, I snuck out. They were infesting our valley."

"How many?" she said slowly.

"Ah..." he started counting on his fingers, and as he did, her brow lifted, "the first two, then the other two. Hmmm... there were five in the alcove? Yeah, five, but then there were only four. I killed three then, but six more came with the alpha, I think? So... thirteen. No, twelve cause of the one that went to get the rest? Wait, did I count that one twice?"

Or thirteen actually, cause he didn't kill that last one. He hoped it was alright. Maybe he should have just killed it— he frowned —or maybe not.

"A large pack, for wolves at least." She stared at him, waiting for something, then shook her head. "A daresay a hunting party would avoid a pack that large, though perhaps not fear it. Yet alone? Not even my brother could claim such foolishness. Yet by your account Jackrets pose a much greater threat. Forgive my boldness, but what possessed you to pursue such beasts?"

Roland flinched, realizing for the first time that she might not believe him.

"They... were infesting the valley." It sounded weak and ridiculous now.

"And so you thought to take them on alone, without at least consulting the weapons master we have here?"

Well, when she put it like that. "I... it's not like I used my fists. I had a weapon."

She turned her head and lingered on the sword. "Yes..."

She clearly wanted to say more, or to ask at least, but to Roland's dismay she simply stood. His heart fell as she carefully placed the chair in front of the desk and made her way toward the door. It fluttered when she turned around, but fell again at her expression, which held sadness.

"I do look forward to training with you again once you recover."

He opened his mouth to reply but nothing came out. She thought he was lying to her, and that truth was as sharp as any knife to the heart. He wanted to plead, to explain how it was all true— he had the wounds to prove it! —but... the look in her eyes was sad, as though she'd given up on him.

"But I had nightmares, and they hunted me, and they... infested..." but she was gone and his destiny, once so full of light and purpose, suddenly felt hollow and empty.

He laid back, trying to figure out where it had gone wrong. He hadn't lied about anything. He'd trusted her with everything— but it hadn't worked. She hadn't believed him and that hurt.

His stomach growled, somehow feeling empty yet again. He should have asked for the fourth plate. It was a welcome distraction for once, and within a few minutes, he'd sketched out his plans to sneak into the kitchen for food.
