# 52 | Jackrets [Roland]

Roland opened his eyes and stared into the dark toward the ceiling of his room. It had been two days since he heard Rose utter those fateful words. Two days for him to stew and plan.

The words hadn't even been meant for him. She'd spoken them to Master Yeng as a warning and it was only by chance that Roland heard it. Chance, perhaps... and fate. The words burned in his mind. A calling, destiny, and Roland Anselm was determined to meet it head on.

He threw off his sheets, walked to the window, and peered out into the night. Early Morning? He wasn't sure and for just a moment he had an urge to ask Sal, who probably woke up knowing what second of what minute had just ticked by.

He squashed the urge. Sal was dead, probably. He'd reconciled himself to that. He had.

Whatever, it was probably early morning. It was time for him to go.

He shrugged himself into some clothes, made his way to the door, opened and then stopped it a breath away from a squeak. He slipped through, quietly closed it, and spared a moment to glare at the light bleeding from under Rose's door — did the woman _ever_ sleep? He turned his glare onto his most recent challenge.

For all that Rose was smart and knew all kinds of stuff; and for all that the woman was brutal and manipulative and clearly trying to break Roland or mold him or something like that; there was yet one, massive, gaping whole in her approach: she clearly did not understand children.

Or, at least, she didn't understand Roland.

Because if there was one thing Roland couldn't abide, it was a place he couldn't go. And Rose, in her infinite wisdom, had placed Roland across from a door with a lock. He was never to go into that room, under penalty of some vague punishment that was certain to be painful.

He had tried the door, of course. That had been— what? —the second day? Third? But unlike the basement, he'd never actually seen her open the door, and so he had no idea where she kept the key. But she did go in there, he was certain. And whatever she kept in there was important or it wouldn't be locked. And he'd slowly come to an important realization: she _must_ have weapons, probably expensive weapons, probably graetech, and she sure as hell didn't keep them in the barracks. Also, not in the library either (he checked).

They were behind this door and its lock that couldn't be picked. He didn't actually know how to pick locks, but that hadn't stopped him from trying. Nor had it stopped him from concluding the lock was clearly of a superior unpickable construction. And who used unpickable locks except to hide the most valuable of treasures?

Locks don't always need to be picked. His own door had lock, and after a bit of fiddling, he'd realized that door could appear locked without fully engaging. All it took was a little paper in the bore, just enough to seem like it was latched without allowing it to lock. That didn't mean it was easy. Even without fully engaging, the latch was spring loaded. Something, or ideally _two_ very thin somethings, needed to be inserted between the door and the jam to scratch back the bolt.

Which is why Roland was bent over with two stolen butter knives, carefully scratching back the lock to open a door he most certainly was not supposed to be in, all the while casting furtive glances at the light spilling from under Rose's door.

It took three tries in about five minutes before he succeeded. Without a wasted second, he slipped inside and closed the door, careful to make as little noise as possible.

He had a jarring moment of panic as his eyes blurred to the already dimly lit room. It took several seconds for his eyes to adjust enough to confirm that no one had been waiting to pounce on him. It took considerably longer for his heart to stop clawing its way out of his chest.

His panic was soon forgotten as he took in a room that contained a whole lot of glass. The room was filled with desks entirely covered in glass cubes, each failing to hide something within. They lined the walls, and were arranged in neatly spaced rows throughout the room. Roland walked over to the closest and stared at a set of five large marbles, deep blue, arranged on velvety cloth. He tapped on the glass surrounding it and tried to understand.

This _was_ a treasure room— he was certain of that now. But for some really odd reason, he'd never thought a treasure room would have so much glass. In his mind, treasure rooms were filled with haphazard piles of glittering things and weapon racks and treasure _chests_. But why the glass?

He tapped on the glass again, frowned, tried to lift it and... it lifted easily. So it wasn't to keep people out. Weird.

The room also had no panel to feed the lights, which meant it was always lit. It brought to mind that strange device in the basement, but he spared no more thought to that puzzle. As he walked the room, his eyes scanned all sorts of objects. Many of them were foreign and most wood, which made his heart flutter— graetech for sure. They had deep colors, hints of red in their depths. Some were weapons, usually knives if they were, and definitely graetech. But he wasn't interested in knives so he continued until...

Weapons rack! He almost shouted in excitement as he rushed over, then stopped with wide-eyed wonder. The center desks had obscured his view, but here now, before him were real graetech swords. There were at least half a dozen— no eight, he counted. Eight graetech swords! His body practically vibrated with excitement. They were beautiful, master works of art. It was probably his imagination, but he could practically feel their desire to warp reality into edges so sharp they'd cut through stone like butter.

Three of them were particularly ornate, with some kind of pale gold inlaid into the wood in ornate patterns. They were each subtly different styles, but clearly siblings. He was sorely tempted, but not even he was quite so stupid as to steal one of those. As difficult as it was lately, he was still quite attached to his life.

With a great reluctance, he tore his eyes from the three pieces of deadly art and turned them to lessor specimens. Compared to the three, these were practically plain, but they were still beautiful. He looked them over with a practical eye. Two of them were curved and a bit longer than the rest. He immediately discarded them as options; he had no practice with curved weapons like that. That left three, and one of those had a thick base that tapered to a point in a way he didn't like.

The final two varied only in their length, but they were the exact style he'd trained with. The shorter weapon fit him exactly, but after a few moments thought he opted for the longer. It was just a little unwieldy and a bit heavier than he was accustomed, but it had longer reach and he wasn't done growing yet. He'd get stronger.

He stared down at the sword, a light in his eyes, a glow in his chest. He had a destiny to meet... just as soon as he could sneak out of the house.

---

Roland knelt in the snow and examined a trail of embedded paw prints. They might be what he was looking for. Maybe. Probably.

Yeah, he had no idea.

He stood up and looked around, chewing on his cheek. It was unusually warm and soon the snow would melt, and with it his tracks, assuming they were his tracks.

Destiny had to be tracked down, because of course it did. It didn't just come out to meet you. But Roland hadn't really considered that tracking was a skill, something learned, something he'd never practiced...

Kind of like the sword bouncing around his thigh, but only kind of. At least he had practiced some, swung it around, and even managed to form a edge once or twice. Then he giggle in delight when it sliced cleanly through a very thick branch, then a rock, then scored a deep trench in the ground. He stopped when he almost cut off his leg.

He adjusted it for the hundredth time, sliding it back in place. He hadn't wanted to risk searching the house for a harness, so he'd slid the sword under his belt. There was a nice sweet spot on his hip where it didn't try to trip him, but the weapon shifted around as he walked.

He should be training with Terra, and not for the first time did he feel a pang of guilt about it. Since that first confrontation with Ven, Master Yeng had mostly paired off Ven with Ashter and Terra with Roland for sparring. True to Terra's word, Ven had backed off into a kind of strained politeness that Roland mostly ignored.

Roland had become quite good at his _pulls_, almost to the point of giving him an advantage against Terra. He could count on one hand the times he'd won, but she was having difficulty figuring out when he was _pulling_ on her. It was only a matter of time before she couldn't tell. It might even have already happened; sometimes, he thought she was just guessing.

He liked to think that he was friends with Terra, and perhaps he should have told her his plans. But then she might have decided he was being foolish and tried to stop him, or worse, tell on him. Oddly, he had no idea what would happen if she had. Master Yeng certainly would have forbidden it, but Rose? He was never quite sure with her. She had, after all, let him run away the first time.

It was an ugly memory, but one that burned the night with dreams yips, growls, and teeth. His hand began to tremble, gripping the hilt of his sword. With effort, he released it and allowed his breath to calm.

It was why he was here. Jackrets. And this time, he was the predator.

Roland decided these were his tracks. The alternative was to walk randomly around the forest looking for new ones only to stare at them with the same ignorant look he levelled at these. So he followed them, heading away from home and deeper into the forest. The snow made for slow going, but he had a solution for that: flight.

Or sort of...

He _pulled_ on a nearby Whitewood, yanking himself into the air, aimed in the general direction of the tracks... and then quickly beyond them. He let go of the of the Whitewood and latched onto another one on the somewhere vaguely in the direction he thought he needed to go.

He _pulled_, then yelped as his body yanked in a new direction, sending him toward the tracks, over them yet again, and then far beyond. The _pull_ had not changed his orientation, causing him to briefly see the forest scrolling by as he instinctually tried to twist his body to face forward.

He managed to half reorient himself before he hit the ground. He bounced once, rolling a little, and then plowed the snow the rest of the way. In the end, nothing was left of Roland except for a large glistening mound of plowed snow.

For a few seconds, the forest was silent. The mound shuddered and shifted. It deformed a little, then a giggling boy shot out of it.

His laughter was cut short as his legs clipped a branch. He spun and flipped, causing him to loose his anchor. and once again he embraced the ground.

This time he groaned as he pushed himself to his feet. He winced at the pain in his legs but he could stand; he was fine. He took a couple steps frowned at the ache in his legs. He should look before flying

He giggled. He'd _flown_— it would never get old. But he clearly needed more practice.

He spotted a pair of Whitewoods, smiled, and _pulled_ on them both at once. For a moment, he thought he'd manage straight through, but just a slight off center quickly cascaded into a arc that veered dangerously close to one of the trees. He hit the ground at an angle and rolled to a stop.

There was a term for this, something he learned from the books Rose was shoving down this throat. Sensitive... something. Dependence? Yeah, that was it. Where you start had an outsized effect on where you end up. Stability in graescence was hard because of it. Small errors could rapidly spiral out of control. It was because of this most people never became shielders, and especially not shapers. The field sympathies — another weird term — could yield power, but they were difficult to maintain, impossible really for anyone who didn't have a natural talent or else a decade to spare for study. And why do that when it was far easier to feed a graetech tool instead?

But, of course, there was no graetech that could fly, not really. Float above the ground a few inches? Sure. Fly, no. That was Roland's territory, or it would be if he could figure out this sensitivity thing.

He anchored one of the Whitewoods and resisted the urge to _pull_. It was harder that it should be; instinct wanted him to _pull_. He let it sit there, unused, feeling it out. He couldn't discern it at all from himself. It more like he was attuning himself, or part of himself?

He anchored to the other tree and maintained both anchors with a very light pull, not even enough to affect his balance.

He walked slowly toward them.

The closer he got, the more he could feel the sympathy between them. Without any more effort, the _pull_ became stronger the closer he got. He had to let up a little to keep from being pulled over.

He stopped in the center of them and stood there, feeling the connection. He recalled when he'd exposed his secret to Terra, when he lifted the puzzle between his hands. This was like that, except he was the puzzle now.

Slowly, he increased his _pull_ on the trees. Tension built in his body, as did an odd feeling of lightness. After a few seconds, he feet left the ground.

He began to veer toward the right tree immediately. He backed off his _pull_, but that sent him swinging back toward the other tree. He back off that one and hit the ground.

It took about a dozen more attempts before he could keep himself stable, floating between the two trees.

It wasn't flying, but it was close enough.

He giggled a little, wobbled, then froze. Whew. He was only about half a dozen paces off the ground, but still.

Slowly, he let go of his pulls and set himself back on the ground.

He could do this all day, but as he looked up at the sky, the sun was already burning high toward noon. He sighed, feeling frustrated and conflicted.

He'd come to kill Jackrets and instead he was floating between two trees. He held his breath for a time and allowed lack to burn off his frustration.

No, he was done with this. He would practice flying another time.

He _pulled_ on the trees, aiming toward the last place he saw the trail, and managed to make it reasonably close. The trail wasn't hard to find in the snow though it was starting to turn a bit muddy. He looked again at the tracks and estimated ten Jackrets, maybe.

He shuddered as he recalled his last encounter with them. How many were there that night? Ten, twenty? But he could only remember five or six. They'd been vicious, cruel in their taunts and attacks, choosing torture over a clean kill.

Oh, but he was looking forward to hunting them.

He followed the trail at a light jog, though he kept a closer lookout for Whitewoods than Jackrets. He took every opportunity to leap and fly, if only for a few seconds at a time. He told himself it was practice, necessary. It would help him track and hunt better. He could move quickly and maybe, just maybe, make up the time he'd spent practicing. And perhaps all this was true.

It was also a stupid amount of fun.

He laughed with every _pull_, often closing his eyes as he whipped through the wind. It was a bad idea, but he couldn't help himself. Those brief moments of flight felt like freedom. He drank it deep and let the moments fill him until he crashed back to the ground. And no matter how many times he crashed or how hard, he always stood up eager for the next few seconds of flight.

The trail ended at a crossroads of a sort, but one he struggled to make sense of. It had ended in a mess of prints, as though the whole pack had congregated and milled about. He pulled out some jerky from his bag and chewed on it thoughtfully as he circled the area. It was hard to tell how many Jackrets had been here, but he was confident it was more than ten.

Twenty then, maybe? He shuddered; that was a lot.

Several tracks led to and from the clearing, almost as though they'd sent out scouting parties, which made a sick kind of sense. They were new to the valley and would need to know the territory. Yet scouting implied an intelligence they shouldn't have.

He circled the clearing several times before he noticed that several of the tracks seemed to veer off in the same direction. He followed one to find it merged with several others, producing a path larger than he'd initially been tracking.

As he followed it, he caught the mergings and partings of other, smaller trails, each its own confirmation that this was the real thoroughfare between their home and the staging area, or at what he thought of as such but... dogs should not have staging areas.

A light snap of wood intruded on his thoughts.

He froze and cocked his head. It was distant but clear, far ahead, maybe on the path, but he couldn't be sure.

His heart thundered. It was probably nothing, perhaps one of the demon rabbits. He glanced at a thicket on his left. The bare branches wouldn't be great but... best to hide in case. At worse, he'd lose a few minutes. At best, he'd have a chance to take out some Jackrets.

He dropped to his knees and crawled through the undergrowth as silently as he could. Half a minute later he found himself in a clearing just large enough to stand in.

He crouched as a small pack of Jackets arrived and stopped where he'd left the trail. He counted four of them as they sniffed around.

His breath quickened as, for the first time, he took in the beast's features in full daylight.

Each Jackret had a pair of long, curved incisors that were clearly intended to latch on to their victim. These were visible even with their mouths closed, giving the Jackrets a menacing visage. Their main claws dug deep into the ground from their toes, larger and sharper than he'd recalled. Along the back of their legs were additional sets of claws, also curved wickedly to latch and hold their prey. These were animals clearly evolved to take down much larger and more dangerous prey, prey much bigger than him.

Sweat trickled down his nose as he tried to remain as still as possible. He glanced up at the sky. When had it gotten hot?

Their hackles rose as they sniffed the area and let out sharp yips at one another. Then they trotted down the path, and he relaxed with a silent sigh of relief.

They stopped only a few paces and turned back.

His heart raced. They heard him, tracked him, and now they came for him.

The first one was pushing into the brush.

Flashes of fur, teeth, and claw burned through his mind. His breath came shallow and quick. The world was suddenly too bright. It floated on the current of his panic.

No.

He was not the prey here.

He pulled out his sword, and stared at the thin bladed, mahogany colored wood. Graetech. It would slice through anything as though through air.

The Jackrets were not small animals. It took time to push through the bush, and it was dense enough to force them to file through one at a time.

He could do this. He could take one at a time, kill it before the next one pushed through.

He fed his weapon energy, but nothing happened. Panic clawed its way out of his stomach, into his mouth, and out as a breathy moan. It was broken, and he was going to be eaten alive.

No.

Control.

The blade requires control. Focus on the task. Nothing else mattered.

Reality flickered around the edge of the blade, twisting the light. Then it disappeared, forming a steady, invisible edge that could cut through anything.

He opened his eyes as the first Jackret pushed through. He swiped at its head but missed as it lowered into a crouch. He shifted out of the way just as it leaped for him. He swiped a backhand swing and severed the leg off of it cleanly. It yelped as it tumbled to the ground. It's severed limb bled the ground between them.

For a second, he stared at the bleeding limb in shock— he'd felt no resistance at all. He glanced at the Jackret. It was whimpering and struggling to it's three remaining feet. He needed to kill it but the second Jackret had already pushed through and was crouched.

He swung at the second and aimed low for the crouch, but this one was already jumping, and he missed, again. He had no chance to swing again as it crashed into him, sending him on his back. He managed to trap its legs, but this trapped his sword arm while his other held off a mouth full of teeth.

He squirmed to free his sword while his other arm weakened and the Jackret inched its teeth closer to his neck. Hot breath pressed against his face. He turned his head and tried not to breathe in the foul air, but his vision dimmed from the effort.

He screamed and worked his arm free. With it he drew his sword across its stomach, expecting it to cut the Jackret in half, but it slid smoothly across its belly. His arm flew out and hit something else with a dull thud. He glanced over to see he'd smacked the first Jackret across the head, which had wrapped its jaws around the blade.

Panic surged as teeth touched the skin of his neck. He could feel the animals snarl in his chest. He pressed back against the teeth and pulled on his sword, but it was trapped. He tried to scream but only managed a gasping whimper.

He could not die like this, not to them. Yet his greatest enemy was the panic that had wrapped around his throat.

Push it down, clear the mind, form the edge.

Nothing happened.

No, no, that's not how this works. He needed control. He need but embrace it and the edge would form. Control. He needed control.

The beast's teeth scraped his neck as the muscles in his arm shook.

Fear flared, then burned into anger, the coals of which flashed rage. He should have killed it, pushed it down, but at that moment he did nothing else but feed that rage into his hand and through it, the sword.

In a sudden motion, the sword broke free. He sliced the head in half of the first Jackret and completed the swing into the torso of the one on top of him, splitting it in half and spilling most of it's guts all over him.

Roland pushed the remains of the Jackret off him and lay for a moment breathing hard as he recovered. Only two Jackrets and he'd almost been killed. He still had to kill an entire pack.

A cold dread spread through his chest. He'd only killed two.

He sat up and gasped at a sudden pain in his side. He was covered in too much blood to see anything, so he grasped at his torso until he came across a clean slice in his shirt.

He groaned a sound that mixed regret with shame. No claw would make a slice that clean. Fearing the worst, he clenched his teeth and felt around for the wound, but it was a shallow cut. It burned fiercely, but it wasn't life-threatening. He would need to stitch it up and never tell Rose that he'd cut himself with his own sword. Ever.

Where were the other two Jackrets? He saw no sign of them. He stilled himself and listened carefully, hearing nothing but a breeze and the rustle of leaves.

He pushed himself to his knees and crawled out while his eyes darted back and forth. Every broken twig sounded loud in his mind, yet when he pushed out onto the trail, he found it empty.

There were too many tracks to know where the other two went, but he could only think that they'd gone back to the rest of the pack to... what, warn them? Could they do that? So they had staging areas, and scouts, and warned each other of danger? The thought did not sit well.

A distant rumble of thunder drew his attention to the sky. Most of the sky looked clear, except for a dark edge just peeking over the mountains. They moved quickly, forerunners of a darker foreboding. That alone almost made him turn back. It could thunder in a snow storm but it was unlikely and the air was warm enough that it probably would rain. That rain would be very, very cold.

He suddenly wanted to go home. This had been a stupid idea, idiotic. How did he even think he could kill a whole pack of Jackrets? How stupid was that. It was. There was no doubt, and he _should_ just turn around and go home.

But he had a destiny to kill them, ever since that night they hunted him. He had to, he had to kill them. Nightmares plagued him, and this was the only way to get rid of them.

Claustrophobic frustration closed in on him. He tried to hold his breath, but it last half a moment before it exploded out of him. He closed his eyes, gripping his wooden sword until he thought it might break, if that were possible.

He forced his breath into a rhythm, ignored the arrhythmia of his heart. Running now meant nightmares for the rest of his life. He would do this, he had to.

He moved down the trail as quickly as he could, one hand held tightly to his side, the other wrapped firmly around the hilt of his weapon. He kept a constant flow of energy to the sword though he struggled to maintain an edge.

Why was it so hard? He should have practiced more. Finding his weapon useless in the middle of battle was an experience he didn't want to repeat. So he reformed it every time it failed, which was often enough to make him nervous.

He rounded a blind corner and almost slammed into two Jackrets coming the other direction.

He spun on instinct and swung his sword out and then up. The head of the lead Jackret split off in another direction from the body, which collapsed. He completed his spin and caught the other by the hind legs. It yelped and whimpered for only a few seconds before he ended its pain.

His heart raced, his hands shook, and his breath refused to slow. It had all happened so quickly, so cleanly. He'd barely had the time to think, yet he'd killed two Jackrets with barely more effort than it took to breathe.

He stared the bodies.

It was so different than the clawing and gasping success he'd barely managed before. He stared at the dead animals while his body began to shake from late-released endorphins. It had felt different. No thought, no planning, no hesitation. He simply acted, instinct taking over before fear had the chance to take root.

It was instinct.

That was the truth he'd missed. His instinct had been honed by a brutal teacher that had no qualms with bruising, lashing, and even breaking her student. But when he approached something new, he always tried to overthink it and created hurdles of self-doubt before he'd ever started the task.

He walked the trail, his mind ablaze. It meant something, instinct, and it seemed opposed to the idea of conscious thought.

As he walked, he continued to maintain his edge, but he intentionally didn't focus on it. Instead, he tried to view it like walking or breathing, something you could consciously control but with no need for concentration. Whenever the edge failed, he would focus on it only so long to recreate the edge and then immediately draw his attention away.

He was doing exactly that when he walked into the Jackret's den.

It was an alcove, of sorts. Mostly a break in the incline where some rock had held back the dirt. He stood in a shade at the edge of the alcove, hidden only by the sharp contrast of shadow cast by a harsh sun who's time was fleeting.

He thought he counted five Jackrets, all of which laid about in the shade of a large overhang. Only five, maybe. It was hard to see into the shadow. He saw no more, but that didn't seem right. There had to be more. Were they in the woods? He could see none, but that didn't mean anything. Were they scouting?

He needed more information.

No, he needed a plan. He must assume the others would be back soon.

He thought up several ideas but discarded all of them. He wasn't stealthy enough to find and pick off whatever Jackrets were hiding throughout the forest. He'd only bring them down on him in force. He couldn't see a way to ambush the ones here. There was nothing but clear lines of sight at every approach. He might surprise them if he dropped down from above, but he couldn't make it up without crashing through the forest. If he could just fly... maybe. But he couldn't fly, not yet.

He didn't know how to draw out only some without alerting the rest. His best bet was to kill as many as he could now and hope we wasn't overrun.

It was a plan, but it wasn't a good plan. It was barely a plan at all.

Dark clouds spotted the alcove, creating contrasts of light and shadow as they blotted the sun. The clouds moved quickly and brought a spattering of rain. If he didn't end this soon, he would fight in the middle of a storm. As it was, he thought hard about sleeping in the alcove at the end of this. Might be better than the rain.

He crept toward the group and kept as much in shadow as possible. Odd they hadn't noticed him yet, except he probably smelled like them by now.

The wind picked up. The group almost looked like they were sleeping.

The sun vanished behind a thick band of clouds and allowed his eyes to adjust to a new truth.

All four Jackrets stared at him.

Four?

They rose at once and spread out to flank him. He backed up and around to keep himself from being surrounded.

Yip yip!

He took a involuntary step back, suppressing the sudden urge to flee. Gods but he hated that sound.

Two of them lunged at him. He rushed the outside one, which jumped back startled.

That's right. He grinned at them a false bravado. He was the predator now.

He shifted direction and aimed at the other one holding back, which somehow seemed even more startled than its brethren. At this point, all he'd done was run around in a circle and confuse the hell of out the Jackrets. Yet it bunched them closer together as instincts demanded they chase the maddened boy.

The last Jackret was too slow.

He stopped himself in a crouch and lunged back at it with his sword out wide. It swiped at him, but its reach was too short and his weapon sliced through shoulder and ribs.

He shifted his momentum again and continued his swing around to spin and catch the two Jackrets that had been chasing him. The first he caught in the chest, slicing it deep as his arm continued into the second one. That one had closed in and while his sword penetrated deep, its claws delve his shoulder and barrel him onto his back. He used the momentum to roll it off him in time to face the last Jackret.

Lightning struck and spread light over the world, followed by a thunderous clap that echoed and rumbled through the mountains.

Roland blinked his eyes clear of the flash.

The other three were dead or dying, and the last one seemed wiser for it. It was smaller than the rest and had not moved to attack, choosing to slowly back up toward the alcove. He watched it warily. It's eyes never wavered as it slowly retreated, yet he couldn't help but wonder just where it thought it could retreat to.

The truth presented itself as a snarling growl.

A brown and black blur raked his shoulder and sent him spinning. His sword flew from his grasp as he hit the ground. His vision swam from the shock.

He looked around disoriented to see his sword lying a pace away. He lunged for it but a mass of matted fur hit him in the chest.

He rolled over it, and then on until it was over him. Snarling teeth pressed toward his throat.

He reach for the sword, straining, but it was too far, more than a pace beyond his finger tips.

Suddenly the Jackret's let up. He hadn't a chance to look back at it before it had ripped into his forearm. He screamed at it pulled on him, dragging him further from his weapon. On instinct, he _pulled_.

The sword snapped to his off hand with painful slap. Holding the blade, he repeatedly beat the top of the monster's head with the butt of his weapon as it dragged him through the mud.

Finally, the beast let go, looking a little dazed, it's eye swollen.

Roland immediately repositioned his grip, formed an edge, and swung it around. But his shoulder was torn and he was too slow as the Jackret lunged at him, loosing only part of its ear as it reattached to Roland's arm. As it pulled at him, he awkwardly swung his weapon back toward it. His torn shoulder allowed no power behind his swing, but there didn't need to be. The weapon sliced through the beast as though it were nothing but a phantom, separating the snout from its head.

He'd never heard a sound so horrible as that which came from the stricken animal.

He rolled over and tried to chase the sound from his head.

He pushed himself to his feet and glanced down to see teeth and part of a jaw still attached to his arm. He didn't have time to remove it, but his hand was still functional, so he switched his sword back to it. He couldn't do much more with that torn shoulder.

There were six more, no seven, including the one who had retreated. That smaller one remained under the alcove, looking terrified and confused. He looked back over the six and noticed a bigger one that must be the alpha. It seemed to hang back, which felt all too familiar.

They were toying with him.

Lightning flashed memory and pitted repressed rage against a tide of helplessness and anger. That night he'd vowed never to be so weak. His breath came fast and irregular. He curled his lips and screamed.

It was cut short as his vision suddenly narrowed. Sparks danced on the edges of an encroaching black. He looked down and saw only blood. It covered his whole left side from his shoulder down, and from his arm it flowed onto the hilt of his weapon, but not the blade. At the blade it separated, flowing around the thin narrow wood and down a frictionless formed edge before being washed away by the rain.

He looked up and blinked away the darkness. The world shifted under his feet.

The six spread out as he stumbled back against the alcove wall.

The rain fell in sheets that whipped about in the wind and stung his eyes. The world seemed to slant, but he couldn't tell if it was him or the rain which tilted. He couldn't understand why it wasn't colder.

The pitiful sound of the de-snouted Jackret scrapped against the inside of his head. Roland tried to shake out the sound, but it wouldn't leave.

His back was against the alcove, but five of them encircled him as best they could. The alpha remained back, probably to let the rest harry him until it could deliver the killing blow. He snarled at it, but his voice sounded weak to his ears.

Lightning flashed and blinded them all. Moments later thunder cracked against his ears and seem to make the world waver.

He pressed his back against the wall. None of the Jackrets could move beyond his periphery, but he also had no where to run.

He snorted a laugh. Run. Cause that worked so well the first time.

The first one lunged at him from the side, but he simply raised his arm in an upward stroke that sliced it in two.

The second attack came almost at the same time, which was unfortunate timing as Roland simply reversed his motion to bring the sword down. It died instantly.

Two down, three left. Well that was easy.

No, four, including the alpha.

Then there was that other one hiding in the alcove. And if the de-snouted one would just die, maybe he could think again.

How many still lived? He'd lost count.

The rest were cautious. They lunged but stayed out of reach of his weapon. Too smart, if only they'd rush him he could kill them. His head spun too much to chase them down. He waved his sword, but his arm hurt, and the hilt of his sword felt slippery.

The pain ate his mind.

He screamed at them an uncontrolled rage. It felt so good that he did it over again and again, pouring out far more than just a moment's madness.

The world wavered against another strike of brilliant light. The resulting crack whipped through the air and pressed against his chest. He blinked, struggled to regain his focus, but everything was under water.

All three Jackrets attacked at once.

He swung a wild blow and killed one instantly but the other two latched on, one to his off arm, the other to his leg. He fell back and slammed his head against the wall as he tried to desperately push the animals off him.

The alpha approached from the side.

His sword arm was still free, though he'd lost his edge again. That edge was life.

Time fragmented, slowed like honeyed fire through his veins, then sped with a snarl of teeth and claw.

He had to concentrate, embrace the empty, form the edge.

Make them pay, ignore the helpless in his soul.

The edge formed, and he swiped.

Blindly he swiped, over and over again, to kill anything that moved. He screamed and cried and poured out his helplessness into endless swipes until the only sound left was the bleating of some pitiful creature.

It took him too long to realize the sound came from him.

He crawled out from under the remains of dismembered animals. There was so much blood and he couldn't tell how much of it was his. His leg was torn and his arms almost useless now. Both burned and pulsed, endless daggers that twisted fire into his body.

The rain pelted down white light and thunder that tore through the valley and his mind alike. He pulled himself with his sword arm and inched closer and closer to the alcove.

This continued for minutes, hours, days. Time slowed and refused to move. Then it skipped forward, sped up, rewound. He was close but forever away. He could never make it, but he was almost there.

Darkness threatened to consume him; water threatened to drown him; mud threatened to pull him under. At times he had to stop and just breath to regain his consciousness. Then he would start again and pull himself one more inch.

The ground was cold, and he shivered uncontrollably. He lay on stone, and it sent deathly tendrils of cold into his very bones. He chuckled out a harsh sound that scrapped his throat.

He tried to push himself up but collapsed. He body trembled in uncontrollable waves. The cold pierced his body, froze his heart, froze his mind.

Something wet and rough raked across his face. He thought to open his eyes but found them unwilling.

A whimpering sound filled his dark, and again he thought he should open his eyes. But darkness beckoned, and he longed only to succumb to its numbing embrace.

It was the cold alone that kept him awake.

And then he felt a soft warmth press against him. He curled around that warmth and embraced it for the life it offered. He buried his head into soft, dry fur, and let the darkness drag him into a fevered sleep.
