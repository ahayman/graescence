# 65 | Climb [Roland]

“What possessed you to climb this?”

Ellie had walked up to the tree he once walked down and looked at it with curiosity.

“Wait, you saw me?”

She laughed. “Well, I have been calling you treewalker.”

“Yeah, but I thought— oh, right.”

She blinked at him a wry smile, waited a moment, then lifted an eyebrow. “So?”

“So, ah what?”

“So what possessed you to climb it?”

He glanced back at the tree and shrugged lightly. “Oh, I just wanted to see around me. I’d never been out of the valley.”

“And so you decided to tackle possibly the hardest tree to climb in the area?”

“No, just the tallest.”

“Huh.” She looked upward and stared for a minute with a small frown. “Take me up there?”

His brow flew up at the request. He never tried pulling anyone other than himself, besides the stupid demon rabbit, of course, and that hadn’t turned out too well. He looked up at the tree as he tried to come up with some way to do it. He churned through several ideas but discarded them all as too dangerous. He could think of no scenario that didn’t result in her falling to her death.

“I don’t know. I don’t think so.”

“Can you pull me to the tree, like you do?”

“No, I can only pull things to myself.”

“Oh...” but after a moment, she lit up a smile. “What if you walk up the tree and then pull me up to you?”

He chewed on his cheek a little and looked back up the tree. He’d need two branches, one under the other. He scanned the branches but quickly realized he already knew of which two to use. If he lay down on the top one, he could pull her up to the one below it. Having settled on a plan, he walked to the base of the tree.

“I take that as a yes?”

He pinched his lips and took a deep breath. Oddly, this next part was what worried him the most. Despite her pet name, he had almost no experience walking up trees — which really was an odd idea anyway — and he had demonstrated an unfortunate knack for falling. He wasn’t sure how he should approach the transition between ground and tree, so he just did what came to mind first. He placed a foot on the tree and anchored himself to it just above. He _pulled_ to the tree while trying to shift his weight from the ground. It almost worked, but the anchor was too low, which caused him to pivot and fall on his back.

A giggle drew his attention backwards to Ellie.

He shot her a scowl. “You’re enjoying this too much.”

“So do you really always just do it?”

“Huh?”

“I mean, do you always just do whatever comes to your head, no matter how... impossible.”

He got up and brushed himself off. “I guess.” He looked back up at the tree. Maybe if he used his knees instead? “This isn’t exactly impossible, just need to figure out a way.”

“Yeah but the first time you literally threw yourself at the tree.”

This time he placed both hands and one knee on the tree. More points of contact should make him stable, hopefully. “I wouldn’t put it that way.”

He anchored himself dead center and pulled. As his weight shifted toward the tree, he lifted his other leg and placed that knee on the tree.

“Oh, I would. You didn’t see it from my angle.”

Having all fours on the tree proved much easier as it provided more leeway in the anchor. He crawled a couple steps to test the feel of it. “And what angle was that?”

“Some crazy boy flying through the air at a tree?”

He grunted. She might have a point, but a grunt was all she was going to get out of him.

He shifted his weight back and forth. Much better, less vertigo, and a hell of a lot less chance to fall.

“Hmm... tree _crawler_ just doesn’t have the same ring to it.”

He winced and growled under his breath. He couldn’t very well crawl up the tree after that comment.

He rose to his knees slowly, careful to adjust the anchor for balance. A moment later, he rose to his feet and felt himself sway under vertigo, though stable enough to not fall... sort of. Down was several directions, and it messed with his head. He was standing, but his head was below Ellie’s, who looked down on him.

“I would have caught you,” she said. He was not reassured.

He walked up the tree. Not that this was easy, of course, but he made sure to keep his posture as relaxed and non-chalant as possible. In truth, he had to concentrate hard to keep from falling, but it felt important that she not know it.

He reached his target branch after only a few minutes. He moved above it, turned around to face down, and let go of his anchor slowly until his chest rested on it, nice and graceful.

Ellie stared at him with a wide-eyed smile on her face, her mouth just slightly ajar. And _that_ made all the effort worth it. That she looked impressed made him feel better than he would ever admit to her.

She was in a good position, so he set his anchor to her center mass and _pulled_ lightly.

She inhaled quickly as she rose into the air while he gasped and almost fell out of the tree before he anchored himself back to it. He shook his head at the stupid mistake. His scramble to remain firm had his heart racing, but she didn’t seem to notice.

She giggled about half way up, which caused her to spin slightly. That only made her giggle more as she looked out into the forest with bright eyes. He considered adding another anchor, but she seemed to enjoy the spinning, so he let her be.

Once she reached the branch, he discovered lateral movement to be tricky. In the end, he had to ask her to push herself around the branch while he pulled her up. It wasn’t as elegant as he hoped, but it worked.

“That was amazing,” she breathed. He shrugged as though it were no big deal, but his smirk betrayed him.

They both began a shockingly normal climb up the tree, opting to take it branch by branch until they reached the top. While walking up and down the tree was undoubtedly awesome, he was too uncertain to try it so far up. She didn’t seem to mind the climb and took to it quickly, giving the impression she had done it frequently.

“How long have you been able to do that pully thing?” she called up from beneath him.

Pully thing, really? He had just reached up to a branch with his arm, so he managed only a half shrug. “A few years.”

“Did someone teach you?”

“Uh... no, not really.”

“Aren’t you being trained by some woman?”

His body tensed as he swallowed a flash of anger. She was the last person he wanted to talk about. “Her name is Rose.” He increased his pace up the tree.

“Rose, right. So Rose didn’t teach you?”

“She just trains me.”

“Trains you, to be a hunter?”

“No. It’s just training.”

Ellie frowned and lapsed into blessed silence. He felt oddly violated, as though Rose had somehow intruded on sacred ground. Even here, climbing a tree with not-her, she somehow invaded his space.

“So what does she train you, then?”

“Listen, she doesn’t even know I can do it.” His tone was clipped and terse.

“Why not?”

His hands clenched white. “Because it’s _mine_,” he snarled.

He flinched at himself, confused at his reaction, and dropped his gaze. “I... I’m sorry,” he said quietly enough that she might not have heard. He shook his head and turned to continue the climb, though his hand shook slightly as he reached for the next branch.

He never looked at Ellie, so he didn’t see the breath she silently released, nor her furrowed brow, nor her intense eyes that had moistened.

She followed him in silence for a minute. “She controls everything, doesn’t she?”

His body flinched. “Not... everything,” he said through his teeth.

She remained silent for the rest of the climb.

By the time they reached the top, the sun had fully set and cast only a shadow of pink into the sky. Directly ahead of them Ionia had half risen and was already starting to fill the night with her own amber light, eclipsing what little of the sun remained. She always appeared larger at first, as though her size meant to trumpet her majesty.

They sat silently, side by side, and together took in the view.

Amidst the moon’s vast orange sands were small green smudges, the Empire’s slave plantations. What was it was like, to live and work there, to spend one’s entire life solely to produce food for others to eat? He would have never questioned it before Rose, but she constantly spoke against slavery, calling it the greatest sin of the Empire. The irony tasted bitter.

“What is it like?”

“What is what like?”

“With her? Is she mean?”

He clenched, then forced himself to relax. Answering would be the best way to get this over with.

“She’s... yeah, I guess. But, I mean, she does it for a good reason. She’s training me.”

“You keep saying that.”

“Saying what?”

“Training... she’s training you, she’s training you, she’s train—”

“Ok I get it!” She had begun to sing the last part.

“I’m just saying.”

“Saying what? What are you saying?”

She shrugged and turned her eyes up to the moon. “You don’t sound like you believe it.”

“No, well, yes, I... no. She says I’m very powerful, and without training, I’ll destroy everything... kill people, even if I don’t mean to.”

Ellie looked ever and pinned him with her gaze. “She says, huh? But you are powerful. I just don’t think you’re the kind of person to kill others without reason.”

He huffed and tried to look away, but her eyes drew him back. The memory of the tortured grek flashed through his head. “I... don’t know that.”

“Have you ever hurt others? Have you ever destroyed everything?”

“No.” It felt like a lie.

“Well then.”

Roland shook his head and looked down now at his feet, dangling over the black. From this height, he couldn’t see the forest floor below. It appeared as though the tree itself was born from darkness.

“I don’t know. Sometimes I feel... something, something inside me I don’t understand. I can feel it move sometimes and it... eats up parts of me.” He huffed out frustration. “I’m not making any sense.”

She continued to watch him.

He shook his head and looked back at the moon, which had risen almost fully above the horizon. “I wonder what it’s like?” It was a tactless attempt to talk about something else.

She followed his gaze. “Up there?”

“Yeah.”

She shook her head slowly, but her eyes danced. “Amazing, I bet. Exciting... and really, really hard.”

“Huh?”

“I mean, it takes a special kind of person to even try what they’re doing.”

He stared at her for a moment before he returned his gaze to the Ionia. He doubted the life of a slave was very exciting, but then, “I guess it would be amazing to live on another planet.”

She nodded enthusiastically.

An odd thought struck him. “Could you... walk there?”

“I’m sorry, what?”

“Walk... could you uh, do your bendy thing and go to the moon?”

“What? No, that’s stupid. Of course not.”

She frowned and turned back to the moon with a pensive look. He turned his head to follow but then had a fantastic idea.

“Wait, could you walk _through_ a door?”

She pinched her face and turned to him. “Huh?”

“Or maybe a wall?”

“What are you talking about?”

“Well, you can bend things right? Why can’t you bend open a way through a door?”

“Through a door? What are you— oh no. Gods no. Seriously? That door is your nemesis.”

“But don’t you want to know what’s on the other side?”

“No.”

“What about the other cell? Maybe—“

“No!”

He huffed out a puff of air. “But—“

“Listen! I cannot walk through solid objects. Why would you even think that?”

“Says the girl who twists herself out of reality.”

“That’s different.”

“Sure…”

She shook her head slowly. “Besides, the ruins are dangerous.”

“But they’re _ruins_…”

“And they’re dangerous. Are you even listening to me?”

“But they’re others right? Maybe—“

“No.”

“Oh come on! You haven’t heard—“

“_No._” She rolled her eyes and turned her attention back to the moon.

“Fine.”

Maybe he could find the ruins on his own. Problem was, ruins left no tracks. You either found them or you didn’t, and he simply didn’t have the time to randomly wander around the forest looking for them. But just the idea of exploring ruins left him with a kind of breathless excitement he hadn’t felt since… well, not since he was a boy, however long ago that was.

The silence stretched between, leaving each to their own thoughts as Ionia continued her climb into the heavens. It felt good to sit and do nothing, to have time, even if only a moment, to stare at the moon and let his thoughts wander.

His thoughts drifted over the countless stories and myths of Ionia. No one wanted to go there, and yet everyone wanted to talk about it, or at least children did, trading in stories of the peoples living in the desert, the fabled Sand City of escaped slaves. None of it was true, of course. Aside from the slave plantations, the rest of the moon was all but unlivable.

Ellie broke the silence, though he couldn’t be sure how long it had been. “You know, mother was like that sometimes.”

He blinked at her, his thoughts not quite caught up to her words yet. “Like what?”

Her words were quiet enough that he had to listen closely. “She would... change. It was almost like she was a different person... and the things she did...”

“Is that why you ran away?”

“No no, I didn’t run away. I’m just here for a little while.”

“How long?”

She shrugged.

“You must be powerful too, to do your bendy thing.”

“Not really... it’s more like I’m broken.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s the only thing I can do, everything else comes out wrong.”

That wasn’t surprising. Whatever she was doing, it was clearly different from anything he’d ever seen or experienced. He couldn’t imagine a mind that could twist reality like she could.

As they drifted back into silence, Roland’s eyes wandered back to Ionia with its slave plantations. How big must they be to be visible from here? They looked like tiny smudges, yet he thought each smudge must be the size of an entire city. Entire cities of slaves. It boggled the mind. Yet each of those slaves probably had a better life than he did or at least more freedom. He was trapped, both by himself and his terrible power and by Rose with her constant training. And he was alone, always alone, even with Rose.

“Are we...” he paused, having started the question without thinking it through first.

“Are we—”

“Are we friends?”

She looked over at him, surprised at the question, and then a bright smile lit up her face.

“Yeah, I think we are.”

A simple answer, but somehow bright enough to float like hope between them. She reached over and placed her hand on his. He almost flinched, though not for her but the touch itself. It had felt so long since he’d had someone touch him in kindness.

He looked over at his new friend and suddenly felt extremely protective. Rose would not take this from him, not now, not ever. Whatever he had to do to keep this secret, to keep it away from her, he would do it.

She squeezed his hand, and he looked up to see a look of concern on her face. He’d been clenching his fist and had to force himself to let go. Rose would never learn about Ellie, never be able to take her away from him. She could stand between many things, but not friendship. Never that.

He was collecting stones, each precious and guarded, each a secret he could hold on to. They were all his and his alone. His _pull_ was one, Ellie now another, and she had gifted him with a third, cycling, something else he would never mention to Rose.

Maybe Rose could help him, or maybe she would try to take it away, maybe she’ll teach it to him anyway. It didn’t matter, because she wouldn’t know, and somehow that made it his to own. It was something she couldn’t have, couldn’t know, couldn’t control. It made him feel free in a way he’d never had before.

Roland got up and shivered in the night chill. Ionia had fully risen now, shedding it’s light into the night to give the forest an ethereal quality. He could see shafts of her light spear the canopy, making the forest floor barely visible. It would help with the journey home, a trip he needed to make sooner than later.

Without a word, Roland and Ellie climbed down to the respective branches they had started up from. Roland braced himself against the tree, once again anchored to Ellie, and _pulled_. He lifted her slightly before shifting himself and thus her over, and then let her down slowly. He heard a distant giggle when she landed.

He anchored himself to the tree and began walking down it. It came easier this time, more stable, less vertigo. He wondered how long it would take before walking up and down trees actually felt normal. It was a weird thought, but he certainly was leading a weird life.

He managed to make to the bottom and transfer himself to the ground without face planting, a feat of which he silently congratulated himself for. Yes, he could walk down trees but not face planting was the real accomplishment.

He stood before Ellie awkwardly, not sure how he should say goodbye.

“Good bye!” Ellie turned and walked away.

“Wait! How will I find you?”

“No need, I’ll find you on your next hunt.”

“How do you know I’ll even have another hunt?”

“You’re _training_, silly. Training involves lots and lots of repetition, sometimes also called practice. Oh, you’ll hunt again, and when you do, I’ll find you.”

Roland opened his mouth to object before he realized she was right. Rose sent him on hunts frequently now, and it was, ironically, his only free time. But she could send him anywhere, in any direction.

“But how?”

She just smiled and waved, then took a step and disappeared. Roland stared after her, stunned. That wasn’t the twisting he’d seen when she disappeared from view. It more akin to the long steps she took when she ran, but taken to an extreme he couldn’t fathom. How much distance had she just traveled in a single step?

He wondered then if perhaps the girl who just walked away from him might also be able to walk to the moon in a single step.

With a sharp pain of isolation, he turned toward home and _pulled_.

---

Unknown and unseen, a pair of eyes watched Roland head into the valley. It would not go there, could not go there, having long ago learned that the valley spelled death. It didn’t understand how this young boy could venture in with impunity. It was confused. The boy had defied it and lived, and that had never happened. He demonstrated skill beyond his age, beyond his size. And there was something else gave it pause, something it did not understand, intuition or instinct maybe. There were things in the forest that were other than what they seemed, able to hide their power and appear small. The boy was like those, except not. It was power hidden, but not power disguised. The boy was both weak and impossibly strong, and that dichotomy created confusion that burned its curiosity.

So it would watch and observe until it did understand, for that’s what it did. It knew no other way to be a predator, and it had all the time in the world.
