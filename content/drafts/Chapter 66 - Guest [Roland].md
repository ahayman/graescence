# 66 | Guest [Roland]

Home.

It wasn’t home, of course, no matter that he’d lived here for years. It couldn’t be, ever. Home was that place hidden deep in his heart where soft memories of laughter and hugs remained buried beneath crisscrossed scars. This place birthed those scars.

No, it was not home.

But it was something. He felt tension drop away he hadn’t realized was there. The forest, no matter how free, was unpredictable and dangerous. He couldn’t know what would happen, what he would encounter. And while he enjoyed the freedom, he knew exactly what to expect here, and that brought about its own kind of comfort.

Light from the window spilled out into the clearing, and already the wondrous smell of cooked meat and heavy spices tickled his nose, faint and fading with the threat of dissolution. He quickened his pace almost to a jog as his stomach became consumed by the prospect of impending loss. He hadn’t eaten since that morning, and his belly practically danced in anticipation of a meal just out of reach.

He opened the door and froze.

“...boy. I can’t believe you’d send him out there alone. You normally aren’t so careless with your projects.”

The voice was unfamiliar and male, with a relaxed cadence that nonetheless put Roland’s hair on end. He had placed a strange emphasis on the word ‘projects’ that Roland couldn’t make sense of.

The door had verged on a squeak, barely caught in time to prevent it from betraying his presence. He carefully closed it without a sound, crept in, and positioned himself in the shadow so he could spy into the kitchen and the man seated there.

The man leaned back in his chair, and he, like his tone, looked utterly relaxed. He was far too well dressed for the forest, with unscuffed boots and thin, tight-fitting pants. A coat was draped over the back of the chair, its style foreign to Roland, but the shirt was loose and open, revealing a lean, chiseled chest. The man looked poised, no matter that his chair was precariously balanced on two legs. Roland couldn’t dispel the feeling of a predator poised to attack at any moment.

“He’ll be fine. You know nothing of his capabilities.”

Roland winced. That was the voice she used when she thought someone was speaking out of their ass, a tone he’d long since learned to avoid.

“Oh, I’m sure I don’t,” the man said in a way that suggested the exact opposite.

He casually turned, took up a cup, and sipped in a non-chalant manner while increasing his lean in the chair slightly. It perfectly mimicked his own tone, portraying exactly the subtext in his voice. The man’s motion felt too calculated, like a kind of act or play.

“You underestimate the boy, a dangerous thing to do in your profession.”

“Well then, why don’t you enlighten me, my dear? I know nothing but that he is a boy unfortunate enough to become one of your projects— and when did you start picking up random boys off the street anyway?”

Roland had stilled as much as possible to listen, yet the silence stretched with only an occasional clang from the kitchen to interrupt it, perhaps louder than normal, or maybe that was just his imagination. Unanswered questions pounded against his clenched jaw, but barging in and spouting them off would go nowhere. So he held himself back while silently urging the man to push or prod, do anything to get the answers he so desperately needed. Yet the man sipped his tea, not the least bothered by the screaming silence. That silence stretched out Roland’s hope until he could feel it tear almost to breaking.

“Fine, you don’t want to tell me, who am I to push you?”

Roland cursed to himself. The fool was playing her game.

“You’re here.”

“I am at that, aren’t I?” He gave a polite chuckle.

“And you’ve yet to explain why.”

“Oh, I haven’t done that either, have I?”

The question hung in the air, then stretched into a tense silence yet again. That tension felt layered, dense, and alien — it didn’t belong here. Rose often used silence as a weapon, usually to give Roland just enough space for his imagination to fill it with terrors. The tension here felt the same but different, and he struggled to identify just how. It was like everything had been... inverted.

The entire scene shifted in his mind. Who was playing who? The man maintained such an air of studied ease amidst the tension that Roland initially took it as a defensive act, something he might do to keep Rose from divining just how deeply her tactics had burrowed. But what if it wasn’t? What if it was an offensive tactic instead?

Something about the man’s eyes. They never wavered from Rose. They were eyes that took in every detail and betrayed an awareness far beyond what his posture sought to portray.

Rose scoffed, and Roland stilled his body further if that were possible. He’d heard Rose scoff before, of course, but never quite like that and he didn’t know where to file it. He tried to find some comparable expression from his memory of her that might discern the noise she just made, but nothing would come. It was tempting to simply file it away as an annoyed scoff, much like her recent tone, and yet it didn’t quite fit. There was an overtone there, something added, that shifted the noise into new, unfamiliar territory.

“What do they want, Sylas?”

Roland has to force down a shudder at her tone. This was beyond annoyed, it was the dangerous tone he’d only ever heard a few times but had always precipitated some of his worst moments with her. But even that fresh spike of dread couldn’t hide the same overtone he’d detected before. It was ever so slight, barely noticeable to anyone who didn’t know her as well as he did, yet to him, it screamed.

She was afraid.

Roland’s eyes snapped back to the man, Sylas, who maintained his ease even as the tension seemed ready to snap back at him. Yet... but no, he drew it out. Far from feeling the tension, he was intentionally building it into an orchestrated apex. While his body somehow looked even more relaxed, behind his eyes flashed victory. Sylas played the silence against her. Even when she tried the same, she simply wasn’t in the same league as he, and Roland had no doubt she was one of the best at... whatever game they played.

“They have some _concerns_ about your more recent activities.”

Each word was measured, gauged, and set to perfect tone for the greatest effect. It really was a game, of sorts, he was sure now, and one in which Rose was loosing.

He felt some distant vindication buried deep beneath a growing tide of unease. Rose was an absolute, like the mountains themselves. He might enjoy seeing her fail at something, yet he couldn’t escape the sense that his world was somehow less stable, less secure than it had been but moments before.

She chuckled, but to Roland’s ears it sounded horribly forced now, and her tone was almost fully subsumed by that overtone of fear that he was tempted to believe was only in his mind, if not for the victory in Sylas’s eyes.

“I fail to see how they would have any concern for anything I might do.”

The man’s relaxed pose turned true. That’s the only way Roland could describe it, almost as though he had practiced his ease until... well, he must have gotten exactly what he wanted. The speculation in the man’s eyes had been replaced by certainty, triumph, the only indication of which was the absence of the prior attentiveness.

Not for the first time did Roland wish he could see Rose, see what her own posture spoke of her. He’d studied her for years now, and when it counted the most, she remained hidden behind obstinate drywall.

“Let’s not play coy, dear. I am here as but a simple messenger and _nothing_ more.”

“And what message would that be?”

Did he detect relief in her voice? The fear had vanished, but relief wasn’t an emotion he’d ever associated with her. Like so much else of tonight, he had no category to place it. She might as well started babbling in tongues and dancing on the table for all that these things belonged to her.

“You really need me to spell it out? An entire province teeters on the edge of financial ruin. Things like that don’t go unnoticed.”

An entire province... and what, this woman who trained him every day for years was somehow responsible? Roland shook his head and tried to make sense of it. That was a large pill to swallow and yet... his hunts? That was the only time they were apart. She wasn’t satisfied with just breaking him, she had to break an entire province in her spare time. It was an utterly ludicrous idea, and he believed every word.

“The province will be fine.”

“Good.” There was a finality to his tone that seemed to signal the end of the conversation.

The man’s posture shifted yet again into something relaxed... satiated? He still appeared the predator but not one ready to pounce. More like one that had just eaten. Unnerving didn't even begin to describe it.

Sylas consumed Roland’s curiosity. The man defied category, wielded a type of power that Roland couldn’t fathom, and somehow installed fear into the only person in the world he thought utterly incapable of the emotion. He’d thought he knew what power was, yet this man upended everything. He never considered there might be types of power, but clearly this man held a kind of power Roland had never conceived of.

A yearning opened in up inside him. He wanted to leave with this man, learn his ways, and then visit every terrible thing he learned back on Rose.

His mind spun until it stopped on a word he’d learned from one of Rose’s political books, of which she seemed to have an endless supply. Had he known what a spy was, he could only imagine what adventures his younger self might have done with such a versatile word. Now, he couldn’t help but recast the entire conversation with the idea that Sylas was one such being, a spy... and somehow, it made perfect sense.

Oh, the behavior of a spy in the books he’d read was completely different from what he witnessed now. Spies weren’t seen or noticed, and yet their goal was almost always to acquire some guarded secret. The ways they did it were surprisingly variant, from disguising themselves as servants to midnight escapades of clandestine adventure, many of which stretched credulity.

Sylas, by contrast, sat in perfect view, clear as day, yet somehow managing to extract from Rose her secrets with act and words alone. The relaxed pose, the way he drank his tea, his... attire, was all designed to pry open Rose’s defenses just enough to extract the information he needed.

If anything, he now had more questions then he’d started with, and fewer real answers. He watched Sylas intently and wondered just what the man would do next, hopefull he would pry out something of actual use from his captor.

Sylas rocked his chair back on all fours, placed his cup down on the table, and sniffed the air. He then sniffed each armpit and curled his lip in disgust. Apparently not satisfied, he then brought up his feet and sniffed each boot. Finally, he sniffed under the table.

“Are you done?” Rose asked in a tired voice.

“I’m so sorry, my dear Rosiland, but I must ask, are you certain you didn’t accidentally kill the boy and stuff him under the stairs? Because that smell is quite foul and I’m certain it’s not coming from me.”

“It took you that long to figure out you don’t smell?”

She walked into view before she stopped and curled her lip in disgust. She gave Sylas as suspicious look.

His hands flew up as a chuckle escaped his lips. “It’s not me, I swear!”

Roland sniffed but smelled nothing, yet the conversation had shifted so quickly. Was it him? While he’d been out for a while, he doubted he smelled quite so bad. He certainly shouldn’t smell like he was dead... oh, right.

He glanced over and noted that the door was still in the shadow, so he reached over and quietly opened it before closing it hard enough to make it sound like he’d just walked in. In the past, he’d had the habit of leaving the door open as he removed his boots, so maybe it wouldn’t be suspicious. Making sure he angled in from the same direction, he walked down the short hall and stepped into the light.

Rose had a surprised and conflicted, if somewhat pleased look on her face, as though she’d just won a bet. Sylas simply looked at him with a single raised eyebrow.

Saying nothing, he removed his sword and leaned it against the table. He shifted his harness around, untied the bag, and set it on the floor, allowing it fall so that it revealed the severed Grek head.

“Good god, you killed that?” Sylas looked at him with something approaching wonder.

Rose, however, stared at Roland’s arm while he was trying to decipher the odd turn of phrase Sylas had muttered.

“You did this?” She gestured to the blue-green wrap, though it was cracked and close to falling off by now.

Roland nodded once. It felt weird to lie to her, and though every pore of his being screamed at her the truth, she didn’t seem to notice.

“So you have been paying attention, good.”

She nodded in approval, but Roland just hoped she didn’t ask him to replicate the thing. There would be some uncomfortable questions if he had to create a caste like this. He still had no idea what the blue-green goup was.

“What is that thing?” Sylas was still fixated on the head.

“A grek,” Rose replied automatically, but paused a moment as she took in the head, “although, quite a bit larger than they normally grow.”

“What the hell is a grek?”

“Uh huh...”

Rose ushered Roland over to a chair opposite Sylas and had him sit down. She closely examined the wrappings as she traced her finger along the edges. Picking off a piece of the hardened clay, she smelled it briefly before placing a small piece on her tongue. She quickly removed it, looking a little perplexed, then glanced down again at the wrap with a creased brow.

“Now _that_ is disgusting,” Sylas prodded, but no one was paying attention.

He grunted and contented himself to watch the exchange, very obviously entertained by the night’s proceedings. His manner had changed abruptly, and for the first time, Roland couldn’t tell if it was an act. It was disturbing to think he’d included him in his performance so thoroughly as to make the distinction impossible to see.

“You found Rodsberry?” she said without looking at him, “It’s... surprising. The dressing even has numbing properties that helped to coagulate the blood.”

Roland nodded, again like he knew what she was talking about. He resolved to pour over the books on flora Rose had in the library before she realized the truth.

“The boy has hidden talents.”

Rose looked up and seemed slightly surprised to see Sylas still sitting there. Her eyes flashed as her mouth shifted into an absurdly innocent smile. “Sylas, oh do be a dear and take that... trophy out outside please?”

He opened his mouth to object, but nothing came out before he thought better of it. The mouth closed with a snap of defeat.

“Oh, and please bury it a good ways from the house. No need for it to attact unwanted attention. There’s a shovel around the side of the house in a small shed, back of the training ground.”

He grunted slightly as he picked up the bag and looked over at Roland with a disbelieving look. He glanced at Rose, then shifted back to Roland with a wry look even as he dragged the heavy bag.

“Lady of the house, boy, remember that. _Always_ listen to the lady of the house else you find yourself in more trouble than you bargained for.”

Roland shot his back a disbelieving look as he tried to make sense of yet another sudden shift in the man’s demeanor.

“Let’s get this off and clean the wound.” Rose’s words pulled him back.

She stood up and walked over to a shelf as a crack of a door signaled Sylas’s exit. She grabbed a single-sided, curved knife and walked back to Roland to begin cutting away at the wrap on the topside of his arm, opposite the injury. After she was done, Roland flipped his arm over and stared at the wounds in surprise. His injuries had closed entirely. There was still a scar, mostly pink and angry, and he could clearly see the claw marks, but now it looked almost two weeks old.

“A graze, you got lucky. Any deeper and you would have lost quite a bit of blood. As it is, you should be able to resume training tomorrow.”

Roland suppressed a sigh. Of course, it did look like he had only been grazed, but he was sure it had been deeper, and he did lose a lot of blood. No, it had healed far better than it should, but at least it deflected suspicion away from him, no matter that it also stole some of his hard-earned victory in the process.

“It appears I’ve been going too light on you,” she said in a distracted tone as she worked. Roland’s eyes snapped to her. “Taking on something that large, we’ll need to make sure you survive next time.”

His stomach dropped, his mind bucked, and dread chocked his breath. The room suddenly felt like a furnace as he tried to come to grips with what she’d suggested. He’d barely managed to handle the training as it was. He’d never considered it was even possible to make it harder, worse.

His thoughts were drawn short by searing pain as Rose scrubbed at his wounds. She had removed the last bits of wrapping and now seemed intent on removing every single spec of goup.

“You use that?”

Roland jumped at the voice and looked up to see Sylas staring at his sword with a slightly confused look on his face. That was oddly quick. Had he just thrown the head out into the forest?

Rose stood and broke Roland out of his musings to realize he hadn’t answer Sylas.

“Uh yeah, Rose has been teaching me to use it.”

“Huh.”

He stared at it for another second more before sitting down across from Roland. He leaned forward on his elbows and looked at Roland with narrowed eyes. “That is no easy weapon to master. And you can form an edge? No, of course you can. The head was severed clean. Otherwise, I might have thought you’d simply scavenged the thing.”

“No, I also cut open it’s belly.” Wait, why had he said that?

“You disemboweled it, whatever for? You don’t seem the vengeful type.”

“Seemed like a good idea,” Roland replied, confused as to why disemboweling it _wouldn’t_ be a good strategy. “I mean, it gave me a chance to cut off its head.”

“Woah, you disemboweled it first and, what, from underneath? How the hell did you get under the beast in a fight? I mean, I get that it was large, but I’d think it would protect its underbelly fiercely.”

“No, it was distracted—”

“Ok, enough stories for now.”

Rose carried in a plate of food that Roland desperately hoped was for him, as his stomach was presently chewing its way up his throat. She placed in front of him a plate with sliced meat covered in some kind of gravy, veggies, and a hunk of bread. The meat was cold, but it all was fresh, and Roland didn’t hesitate to dig in, though he paid particular care to make sure he didn’t moan. He seemed to have gained some respect from the spy and didn’t want to lose it all by showing a childish lack of control. It was surprisingly hard.

Sylas leaned back again in his chair and studied Roland as he ate. After a few moments, he shifted a calculated gaze beyond Roland to Rose behind him. He looked oddly thoughtful, more so even than during his conversation with Rose, as though he’d encountered something he didn’t know what to do with.

Roland wasn’t sure anymore what to make of the man. He still kept up a portion of his act that Roland had witnessed earlier, but his whole manner had shifted subtly since he had walked back in. He was sure it was still an act — if only from before — and yet somehow it worked.

He wanted to gain Sylas’s respect, needed to. He felt desperate, like he’d been presented with a lifeboat in the middle of a storm-tossed sea, if only he could figure out how to climb into it.

“Roland, you finish up the food. Sylas, I think you’ve gotten what you came for.”

“Ah, shall you deprive me of such wonderful company so soon?” Though it was unclear to which company he referred.

“I think you have other matters to attend.”

“Alas, you are probably right, and since you’re the person to get me there, I shan’t overstay my welcome. But please do invite me back sometime. I’d love to see how Roland handles himself in a few years.”

It felt ominous and encouraging.

Sylas stood and offered Roland his hand. Roland hadn’t expected it, so it took him a moment to realize the offer, set his dinnerware down, and take the proffered hand. Sylas gave it a quick shake and squeeze, nodded his head, and walked toward the front door.

Roland had just picked up his silverware again, but before Sylas left the room, he turned back to Roland and with a serious expression.

“Hey, keep training. You’ve got potential, and that should never be wasted.”

Sylas flicked Rose a pointed look and turned back to the door. Roland stared at the man’s back as they left, unable to process yet another shift in the man’s attitude.

“I don’t know, Rose, you might have stumbled onto...”

Roland watched them leave with a sense of longing and loss. A part of him wanted to run after Sylas and beg him to take Roland with him. He knew it wouldn’t work, of course, yet the urge remained coiled around his insides. Had he wanted Roland, he would have asked or, perhaps, simply taken him, but he clearly considered Roland to be Rose’s property.

But Sylas had been impressed with Roland. He felt... something, excitement? It was such a foreign feeling but addictive. He would do anything to gain the man’s respect, his praise, and he didn’t understand why. He didn’t know him, barely even met him. Yet the man had such power, such poise, and possessed some ineffable confidence that he yearned for.

And he would come back.

He would, Roland was certain. His offhand comment to come back felt like a threat to Rose, and a promise to Roland. He would come back, and when he did, Roland would be ready. He would be ready. He would make sure of it, train harder, do better, overcome more. He would become something valuable enough for Sylas to want. Sylas would take him away from here and teach him.

Roland vowed he would be ready when he came back.

He felt a familiar tug inside him and knew the man was gone. He felt it whenever Rose came or went, and was sure it was gravic related. Aside from that, he had no idea. Whatever it was, she guarded it perhaps even more closely than the mysterious door across from his room.

Rose returned, and Roland closed his thoughts as she sat where Sylas had a few minutes ago. He was still eating, so she placed her hand on his to stall him and looked him directly in the eyes.

“Roland, that man is exceedingly dangerous. You managed to gain his respect tonight, something rare.” She leaned back a little, her lips pressed slightly. “But this places you on the board, for him at least, and that could be catastrophic.”

“I don’t understand.”

“No, you don’t—“

“But isn’t he just a spy?”

She blinked, then squinted. “A what?”

“A spy?” It seemed so obvious a moment ago.

“No, Roland, he’s a— what makes you think he’s a spy?”

Rose waited patiently while he processed his own conclusion, second-guessed it, and replayed the night only to circle back to the first conclusion.

“Everything he did was too specific... accurate, like the way you move when we train.”

“The way I move?”

He nodded. “Nothing wasted, every movement a purpose.” It was one of her incessant mantras.

“What purpose?”

“Information, just like the spies in your book. He just used his body... ah... motions—“

“Language?”

“Yeah, that. He used it to get what he wanted. Once he had it, he stopped acting.”

“You think he got what he came for?”

He felt suddenly exposed as she leaned over with a dangerous look. He nodded weakly.

“And what information did he get?” Her tone made it clear a wrong answer here might be the last thing he ever said.

“I...I don’t know... I didn’t understand what you were talking about.”

She relaxed a little, but it felt like a temporary reprieve. “Then how do you know he got what he wanted?”

“Because he stopped acting, and he stopped watching you so closely.”

She leaned back, and much of the intensity of her face drained away, though her lips remained pressed in thought. After a couple minutes, Roland began to pick at his food, though less from hunger and more as a distraction. He felt off-balance from the night, and this line of questioning didn’t help.

“He’s an assassin,” she said abruptly, “the very best. He’s played a very complex and dangerous game for a very long time without once faltering.” She shook her head slowly. “_He’s_ the one they send to kill Kings and Royals alike, and _he’s_ the one they will send to kill you if they ever find out what you are.”

An assassin? “They?”

“The Empire, Roland. The Empire will send Sylas to kill you for simply existing. You must be wary of your words. One slip and they — he — could find out what you are. “

A monster. His jaw clenched. He’d almost allowed himself to forget. But of course, she sent him out to hunt only to understand that he would one day be hunted in kind.

“Let’s get some rest, you’ll need it.” It felt like a concession to his weakness.

He glanced down at his plate, mostly eaten with only a few vegetables left. It wasn’t like him to leave food on a plate, but his appetite had fled amidst the confusion in his head. So he stood, walked to the sink, and absently washed his plate while his emotions waffled between dread and excitement.

Things were going to get much more difficult.

He had serious doubts his sanity would survive training more intense than the normal his life had become, but he didn’t have a choice. There were no options, no ideas that might deliver him from the necessity of it. No escape. A part of him wondered, dreaded even, what he might become in the process, what insanity his mind might conjure simply to cope. But those thoughts were quickly squashed. It didn’t matter, because there was nothing he could do to escape this fate, short of suicide and he’d long since realized his drive to live was too strong to consider that option.

And excitement.

Of all the emotions, this one was simply unfathomable, and it didn’t mix well with the dread. His mouth felt dry, and his stomach unstable as he struggled with contradictions.

An _assassin_ had shaken his hand in respect.

The idea belonged to a younger self, one still enamored by pirates and adventure. He had gained the respect of the greatest assassin in the Empire, and the very words sounded like a fantasy. Oh, of course, he was the great Roland. He was living his dream, caught in a twisted fantasy of youth that was killing him. He would live out this fantasy, but what would come out the other side? Who would he be?

Despite those fears, he couldn’t suppress the excitement. He’d earned the assassin’s respect, and the man would come back. Hope had so mingled with dread until he couldn’t tell the difference.
