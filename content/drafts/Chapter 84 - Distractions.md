# 84 | Distractions

Skin was the most challenging organ to work with. It was large, for one, and it changed shape constantly, twisting and stretching, morphing and compressing. It was permeable and waterproof, selective in what it let in. It was soft and yet resilient in a way nothing else could be.

And perhaps most importantly, skin lied. It would readily accept whatever patterns Roland threw at it, happily integrate his carefully shaped energy and then break it just as quickly.

In any other part of his body, specific types of patterns simply wouldn’t take hold. Perhaps frustrating at first, it provided assured feedback whether a new pattern would work or not.

But not skin. It would accept anything, yet he was never sure how long it would last. Sometimes an hour, sometimes a day, sometimes it would break the moment he stood up. That might even be okay if it were consistent between patterns. But the same pattern applied on different days would act completely different. It was only through repeated attempts, every day, over months that he could gain some intuition as to whether one pattern worked better than another, at least on average.

He did not try daily, often not even weekly. The skin was a big organ, and it took hours to form his cycle into an appropriate pattern. He only had so much time, and it was frustrating to have hours worth of work disintegrate the moment he moved his hand to scratch his nose. So he often found one excuse or another to work on some other part of the body that might yield him better results, like his muscles. He spent a lot of time on those.

But the camp afforded him a surprising amount of leisure time. They didn’t get up at the crack of dawn, nor even an hour later, nor even an hour after that. For him, sleeping in had him up at least an hour before dawn, and that was during summer. With winter in full swing, he both found time to sleep in and then too much of it with nothing to do. Therefore, skin. Patterns were an odd—

“How long do you think he’ll stay like that?” Fin said.

“I don’t know, but have you noticed he hasn’t moved a muscle? Not even a twitch.”  Anna’s tone was laced with a kind of exasperated awe.

Right... so, skin. Patterns were an odd thing. There was essentially an infinite number of patterns, so finding a new one was very much a creative art, barely more than an informed guessing game really, although often good patterns seemed obvious in retrospect. The problem lay—

“You think he slept like that?”

“No, no way.”

“Eh, well, he’s definitely got you beat on the whole meditation thingy.”  Apparently Stan had joined at some point, for Roland doubted the comment was aimed at Anna.

Stan grunted an irritated noise.

The problem lay in identifying characteristics in a pattern that matched what it was applied to. Fractals worked well in the mind, for instance. That made sense in a fashion, and he’d used a fractal pattern for quite a long time. But it wasn’t until he’d tried interconnecting the fractals that he saw considerable improvement. He still had no idea why, except for a few guesses—

“No but look, there’s a fly on his face, and he hasn’t twitched. How is that even possible?”

“Huh, you’re right. Do you think he knows?”

He did now.

He’d been playing around with an idea for a pattern based on how threads were woven together to make clothes. The idea came to him a while ago, but it was tedious to create, to say the least, and so he’d put it off for a better time, like now—

“That’s gotta tickle. I mean, is he still alive?”

If alive meant he felt every sensation on his face, then yes. The fly had slowly walked from one brow to the other and left a trail of sensation that seemed to linger, as though someone had painted a line of itch on his face.

“Oh, he’s alive, alright.” Stan spoke with an oddly distracted tone. Blessed silence followed.

So far, he’d managed to embed the pattern in about half his skin. It was a frustrating and complex endeavor. No matter where he started, the pattern would eventually bifurcate as it encountered appendages, forcing him to either handle multiple patterns at once or else hold patterns in place while he finished others. Either way, he then had to merge the two or more patterns, and that never worked as he thought it should. But, if he inverted—

“Okay, seriously, care to share, Mr. dethroned meditation guy?”

Silence followed, though it felt absurdly pregnant.

“Okay, I have to admit I’m curious too.” Anna chimed in.

“Well, I can feel him doing something,” Stan’s voice appeared to be aimed at Anna, “but I can’t quite figure out what. It feels like he’s gathering a lot of energy, but I have no idea where he’s putting it.”

“Huh...”

“Oh shut up, Fin. It’s not like sensing gravics is a well-developed science.”

“And _that_ sounds like an excuse.”

“I’d like to see you try—“

“Hey, I’m not the expert here, you are,” a small pause followed, “or perhaps you _were_.”

A surprisingly virile growl escaped Stan’s lips, but that only spurred a satisfied chuckle from Fin. Roland awarded Fin a point for that round. Ugh, distractions.

_If_ he inverted the pattern and worked those opposites up each limb — he started with his legs, or rather, his toes, itself a mental feat managing ten small patterns — then he found it much easier to join those patterns when they reached the torso. They were basically an inversion of each other he could easily work back into a single pattern around his pelvis. So far, he’d managed about halfway up his torso. It might take him another half an hour before he reached his arms and was forced to handle three large patterns at once, something he was not looking forward to.

Also, the fly had moved, slowly and in a lazy meandering, from his eyebrow down to his chin. He struggled to comprehend what was so fascinating about his face.

“Okay, I’m officially bored,” Fin said.

Thank the forgotten gods.

“Hmmm...”

“And I’m hungry.”  It sounded like both a question and a statement.

“Yeah yeah, fine. Let’s get some breakfast.”  Stan seemed torn, but apparently, hunger won out against whatever fascination he had over watching a meditating man do nothing. A light grunt from Fin was followed by the rustling of clothes and receding steps that still felt far too loud in his ears.

He was not looking forward to keeping three patterns in his mind at once. One held in stasis at the torso, two others for each arm. Then to take those and join them back together would take all his considerable focus.

Also, Anna was still there, and he was sure she was watching him. Was she just waiting for him to twitch? He briefly considered acquiescing with an eyebrow, but perhaps that would invite discussion. Seemed risky.

The fly suddenly took flight, and he felt oddly abandoned.

Three different patterns had to be maintained and then joined. Those down his arms would be tricky for several reasons. He wasn’t starting from the ends, so he’d need to somehow bring the patterns back up the arm to join them to the torso. Or maybe he should have started new patterns at the end of his fingertips and attempt to merge them into the original pattern at his torso? That would be a big problem. His torso consisted of thousands of strands, and all he had to do was miss one for the whole thing to fall apart. Perhaps if he—

She was _still_ watching him. He felt her eyes. They bored into him relentlessly. What was she waiting for? Nevermind. He had a fly crawling across his face for only the gods knew how long, so certainly, he could handle the unrelenting stare of Anna.

Perhaps if he could double wrap the pattern back up his arm, then he could rejoin his torso. But would the double-back interfere with itself? Always his pattern remained separate from itself, even if by a hair’s space. It had to be, or it would join together and cease to be a pattern. Doubling back could very well cancel out the whole pattern. After so many hours of work, it seemed risky. But it would allow him to consider the pattern almost as an extension of the torso, easier to manage instead of three separate ones—

She hadn’t moved.

—He just needed to manage the double-back, except the pattern was not two dimensional. It permeated the entire surface of the skin. The double-back would have to weave itself in between the original, if that were even possible. Perhaps if he used fewer threads, or half the height, but that would require threading them back through each other in the transition. Or maybe—

He stopped and let out an audible sigh. “How long are you going to stare at me?”

“Oh, you’re alive?”

It hadn’t sounded like a question, so he remained silent. The silence stretched until finally, he gave up and opened his eyes. The pattern he’d spent hours painstakingly creating unraveled.

He paused, head cocked, with a frown. It didn’t break, it unraveled slowly. That was actually quite promising. If he could just find the time to finish it, it might just be resilient enough.

“Forget something?” Anna had cocked her head to match his in question with an imperiously raised eyebrow.

She was closer than he’d thought, seated cross-legged on the ground in front of him, a cup of something in her hands that had probably been steaming at some point given she still held it for warmth. She’d been there a while, longer than he’d realized.

He blinked and looked around at the camp. It was light out, lighter than he’d expected, with the sun almost breaking over the nearby ridge and the morning fog in full retreat. People were already moving about, eating, and starting their day. Time, it seemed, had been slippery that morning.

“No, just realized something.”

“Oh?”

He opened his mouth before he realized that explaining everything was not something he wanted to do. “Ah... just that it’s later than I thought.”

“How long have you been sitting here?”

He shrugged. “Not sure.”

“But why? You were sitting here when I got up hours ago, and you haven’t moved.”

“It’s just something I do in the morning.”

“Something you— wait, you do this every morning?”

He nodded, and her face shifted to consternation as she considered his words. Stan and Fin, having retrieved their breakfast, could be seen ambling back to them. His stomach took the time to remind him that he too should eat, preferably sooner than later.

“Something to do with your training?”

He shifted his attention back to her. She’d emphasized the word training as though she didn’t really believe it.

“It helps me center myself before the day.”

“And you need several hours to center yourself?”

“It’s somewhat common among practitioners,” Stan said as he handed a bowl over to Roland, who accepted it with a grateful expression. “Although I’m curious as to what technique you use. I’m familiar with most, and I still couldn’t figure out what you were doing with all that energy.”

Fin let out an amused grunt.

“Just creating patterns.”

“But not shaping?”

“Obviously, he was doing something far more sophisticated than you could manage,” Fin said.

Stan let out a sigh and turned to Fin. “Not everything has to be a competition.”

“I’m pretty sure that’s not true.”

Anna turned to Stan with a frown. “So students at the college spend hours meditating every day?”

“Ah, well... no, they spend most of their time in class and likely the rest drinking. I mean, they probably should at least practice that much and I’m sure some do, but no, I doubt it’s all that common. Something about sitting still seems antithetical to youth.”

She turned back to Roland. “So, you were practicing?”

“I... guess? I never thought of it like that—”

“*Any* manipulation of gravics is practice.”

Roland conceded Stan’s point with a nod, though cycling felt like a different kind of activity than shaping or even _pulling_. He hadn’t spent much time considering how they might be interrelated, though he supposed they must be on some level.

“It seems hard to just sit still like that, no matter how old you are. Not even Stan here could manage that.”

Stan shot Fin a brief scowl. “It’s easier when you’re focused on something. I don’t think I could do it without focusing on a task.”

“I don’t think you could do it at all, even—”

“Fin, think you could cut it out for just a minute?” Anna turned back to Roland. “So, I don’t understand. What are you trying to achieve?”

“Better control, I guess?”

She frowned at him with pinched lips. “You guess? You sit meditating for over three hours every morning for better control... you *guess?*”

He nodded and scooped out more food from his bowl in an attempt to avoid eye contact, which he felt would only serve to urge her on. After a few bites, she huffed and got up. He didn’t look up until he heard her steps recede, and only then did he turn to Stan.

“What’s her problem?”

“She doesn’t understand you, and it frustrates her, which is fun to watch,” Fin said.

Stan let out a snort and nodded with a small smile. “Yeah, that.”

Roland watched her walk away and felt a fire flare up inside him. She had watched him for hours and then drilled him on why only to walk away in a huff. She taunted him with her touches and looks, yet refused to talk to him in any reasonable manner. She gave him looks he couldn’t discern, and half the time she appeared angry, the other half confused, the final half as though she wanted to eat him. She studied him, and something about it reminded him too much of the way he hunted.

He would not be prey. Never again.

He stood, inadvertently spilling what remained of his bowl.

“Oooo, huh oh.”

Stan looked up at Fin’s voice and then followed Roland’s eyes to Anna.

“Oh, I wouldn’t—“

But Roland had already started walking.

He caught up to her in a few bounded steps, grabbed her by the upper arm, and spun her about. “What’s your problem!?”

She, in turn, yanked her arm back with enraged eyes. “How _dare_ you touch—”

She stopped herself up short and blinked in surprise at the words she’d spoken through clenched teeth. A brief moment of confusion clouded her eyes before anger settled back in. “*You’re* my problem.”

“What have I done to you except help?”

“Oh yeah, _help_. And the lost boy in the woods carries a sword of the likes I’ve never seen, knives that could pay for a small village, and _somehow_ is trained in the art of swordplay to a degree that most Royals would sell their own mothers for.”

He took a step back in confusion. “Wha—“

“Who sent you?”

“Sent me?”

“Yes! I’m not a fool, Roland, no matter what my father may think. Who _sent_ you?”

“Your father?”

“YES!” she yelled in triumph before confusion clouded her eyes again. “I... I...”

She looked into his eyes desperately, her own flicking back and forth in search of some hint of recognition. Yet what she found there was nothing but the genuine confusion of a boy who’d found himself way over his head in an argument he didn’t understand.

She screamed and shoved him away in a juvenile display of frustration before turning on her heel and stalking away. Roland watched her go with a shell shocked expression.

After a few moments, he felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see Jonah with a compassionate expression.

“How about we go work on some traps?”

Roland glanced back over at Anna, his face a war zone of conflicted emotions. He forced himself to unclench his hands and turned back to Jonah.

“Yes, let’s.”
