# 77 | Compassion

Roland _yanked_ himself to the side so hard his head snapped against his shoulder. A concussive shockwave chased him and then stole the very breath from his lungs. He had hardly a moment to reflect on his brush with death before he hit the ground. Despite his surprise, his instincts guided him into a smooth roll.

He rose to his feet and faced the Linrix but then froze. It had tracked him perhaps half the distance then stopped suddenly, one foot crossed over the other as though forestalled. It watched him with an oddly expectant expression, head cocked to the side.

Doubt wormed its way through his stomach.

A loud crack made his eyes grow wide. He snapped his head around to find a tree, it's trunk shattered, falling directly at him. He _yanked_ himself yet again and felt something pop.

It was not a good day for his neck.

The tree clawed him out of the air and pinned him to the ground face down. He groaned and pushed against it, but it barely moved. He barely had seconds before the linrix would fire again. Panic clawed at his mind and urged him to push harder, yet it yielded barely more than before.

He almost _pulled_ himself out, but that was too dangerous. He could just as well tear himself apart as pull himself from the tangled limbs.

He needed to be stronger. Panic demanded that he be stronger. Survival hinged on his strength.

He forced the majority of his cycle into his torso and pushed. He strained, grunted, and lifted himself up with straightened arms as the fallen tree creaked in response. He had successfully accomplished the most difficult push up ever. His arms shook, and he looked up only to find the linrix that was lining up its shot.

His eyes narrowed in realization. All that effort had done absolutely nothing to get him out from under the tree or his situation.

He'd allowed panic to fill the empty, and it would cost him his life.

He collapsed as yet another concussive blast pierced his ears. The shockwave pushed him into the dirt and released pressure from his back. For a terrifying instant, he thought his back had been torn asunder, but he rolled over onto it and saw it was the tree that had been obliterated.

He barked out a laugh. The stupid animal had freed him. He blinked at his luck, and then, not wanting to test fate, he _pulled_ himself into the trees.

The world wavered enough to make him worry about his head. Once he reached the lower branches, he turned himself about to face the linrix... who was lining up another shot.

He managed a small sigh before he _pulled_ himself out of the way.

How many shots did this thing have left? It hadn't fired this time. It was probably conserving its shots.

He tried to move around toward the back, but it shuffled around to keep track of him. He tightened his eyes as he watched it. The wings could track him almost instantly but only within a narrow range. Move beyond that range, and it had to shuffle itself around to keep track.

He removed his bolt caster and lined up a shot as he _pulled_ himself around to keep out of its range. He fired, and a bolt streaked toward the beast.

Its wings snapped up to block the bolt, whereupon it ricochetted away.

Roland blinked slowly. That was one hell of a shield. A bolt cast like that would embed itself in even the strongest surface either he or Rose could produce. To ricochet like that suggested a shield well beyond anything he was capable of.

Also, the Linrix was lining up another shot.

He _pulled_ sharply and just slightly too late.

He grunted in pain as a chunk of flesh disappeared from his arm. The attack spun him around, and the shockwave pushed him away.

The world wobbled and twisted. He tried to force the world into coherency, but he sabotaged his efforts with panicked eyes that darted around to find the linrix.

All he could see were trees.

He _pulled_ in a random direction in the hope that it would keep the Linrix from firing its last bolt. His head struck a tree and created an explosion of light before his eyes.

He _pulled_ in another random direction and clipped his legs against a branch. His body flipped over several times before he righted himself. Still, he couldn't see the linrix, but he was sure it was lining up another shot.

Another _pull_ and the breath left his lungs as he wrapped himself around a tree.

Through the pain, his mind idly informed him that perhaps this tactic was not working out so well. But on the bright side, he'd finally found the linrix. It had folded its wings tight against its body and had sat, apparently, to enjoy the show.

If it were possible, he might have hated that thing even more than his slow-burn loathing for Rose.

He extricated himself from the tree and floated himself front and center. He was mildly surprised to find he still had his bolt caster in hand. The Linrix had followed him but hadn't moved more than its head.

It occurred to him that acting like an idiot was a fantastic way to confuse and disarm his enemy. Being an idiot, though, was not.

In a smooth motion, he rose his arm and fired the bolt caster. At the same time, he swiped a throwing knife and sent it in pursuit of the bolt. Despite his idiotic behavior, he'd watched the Linrix closely and timed the blade perfectly.

As expected, the Linrix threw its wings up and blocked the bolt. Just like last time, it didn't leave them up but instead snapped them forward to fire a counter-strike. This left an opening for the knife, which embedded itself into its eye socket.

The linrix screamed as the dagger embedded into its right eye. The throw wasn't powerful enough to kill it, but it was certainly enough to distract it.

One of the anchors he had set a while back had been to the Linrix itself. It was a habit he'd long since developed for the purpose of surprise. So far, he hadn't used it at all, but now that the beast was distracted, he _pulled_ hard on it while he retrieved his sword from his back.

And so he flew toward the Linrix as it roared up in pain to create an opportunity he couldn't pass up. That lasted barely a moment too quick. Whether by deceit or reflex, it pulled itself down before he had a chance to even blink and fired its last shot.

A great emptiness opened up within him. He lost every anchor. His body went limp, and the ground rose up to consume him. His mind imploded into the empty.

----

A child stood before him. Endless emotions flickered across the face, almost as though the boy had consumed so much of life that it could not be contained within him. He stared at the boy in fascination as insanity seemed mere moments from breaking free. Rage, love, disgust, pain, pleasure, and an endless spectrum between them showed randomly, each one barely registering before another took its place.

The child was accompanied by a roar. It didn't register at first, so fascinated he had been by the scene before him, and when he did turn his attention to it, he didn't immediately recognize what it was. It thrummed in his chest like a thousand roaring rock trolls, each with the sound of a landslide. No, it wasn't falling earth that he heard, it was water. It was the sound of a single waterfall churning endlessly into itself.

No, tides. The boy held back the tides.

Roland took a step back, confused and horrified by what stood before him. Dread leached life from his bones.

He stood before his monster, and that monster was him.

The boy took a step toward him and reached out a hand in supplication. While the emotions continued to insist on insanity, yet appeal and pleading somehow reflected the boy's intent most. It was a horrifying proposition, for the insane to beg you to join with it.

Terror pushed Roland another step back. He wanted nothing more than to run, to hide, to flee this monstrosity. Yet for reasons unknown, he was rooted in his place, tied to the terrible boy before him.

The boy reached out, but this time held forth but a single finger, a concession. One need but touch the insanity for salvation, nothing more.

Roland withdrew his arms into himself. He wouldn't — couldn't — touch such a thing.

The boy moved closer.

His eyes shone a deep, pure azure that bore certainty in all its forms. In them, Roland could read and see the truth in all its horrible facets.

In the boy was every good thing he'd sliced away. In him was every fear, every pain, every weakness he'd pushed down. The boy was everything he was not, everything he refused to be, every hope he'd murdered in the name of survival.

The boy knew nothing of these things, yet had consumed them all, become them all.

Every facet spoke the same, every angle reflected into a single, immutable truth. In this boy alone was salvation, no matter what insanity it might entail.

Understanding truth and knowing truth are inherently two different things, and never has there one existed who could explain the difference. What Roland knew then was that this truth was undeniable.

His mind buckled under the realization. He could no more separate himself from the boy than he could cleave himself in two, though perhaps that was exactly what he'd done. Without the boy, he was lost. With him, he was insane... but alive.

He reached up with a trembling hand and touched the offered finger.

Roland stood and looked around in curiosity. He was in a forest. Odd that, though he didn't know why. He dug into memory and found nothing there. He was nothing, a blank, an empty... an enigma.

A small gasp of delight escaped his lips. He didn't really know anything, but that hardly mattered.

A beast stood in front of him with a dagger in its eye. He felt compassion, and that felt like delight and pain mixed together. Poor thing that it should suffer so. Anger and sorrow warred in him against the affront that someone would injure such a magnificent animal as this.

Roland started to walk, but the effort was more than it should be.

He stopped, looked down, and then grunted in confusion.

He was not whole. Entrails and blood worked to trip and bind him. He looked about and saw too much of himself spread around the forest floor.

He recalled all that was himself back.

Precious moments were wasted as blood and flesh worked to make whole what had once been scattered.

The pain of it was intense and nothing at all.

Once done, he looked himself over with satisfaction tainted with just a little discontent. He was far too thin, but that was a problem for another day.

He paused in confusion. What was thin? It was knowledge not his own, yet the word had a meaning he called up without effort. He tried to call up other words, other meanings, but nothing came. Knowledge, it seemed, was contingent on experience, and of that, he had none.

He walked toward the beast.

Sensing his approach, it snapped its wings forward and fired something at him. He _grabbed_ the thing and held it before him, head cocked in curiosity.

Around him broke a concussive force that surprised him. The beast had managed to break sound itself. Impressive.

What truly held his attention was the composition of the thing. It was loaded with the gravic element, ingeniously combined with several organic compounds to create an epoxy of incredible strength, not to mention the motive potential that the gravic element provided. This composition could be used, it was important. He itched to do something with it, but unlike the knowledge of the word thin, no words arose from his mind to give meaning to that itch.

He discarded the bolt and walked calmly to the beast. It was clearly in pain. He wanted to fix that, to fix the animal. He felt he should do something. Suffering such as this should never be ignored.

He shushed and hushed as he approached the beast. It thrashed and mewed, and the sounds drove a knife into his heart. Roland clenched his teeth as sorrow and pity assaulted him. Such noises should never come from magnificence. His heart broke, and tears flowed down his cheeks.

"I'm so sorry for what has been done to you."

The beast tried to take a step back, but it stumbled and fell. Then it snapped its wings forward in a last, desperate attempt for defense.

Roland's eyes closed in sorrow. Ever had pain caused those in its thrall to thrash against the truth. He disbanded its shield and parted its wings.

If surprise ever existed, it then showed its face on that beast amidst the pain. Roland knelt and reached his own hand forward.

The beast seemed to gain understanding and lowered its head. On it, Roland placed his hand. Its cycle was weak and fluttering. He might be able to repair it, but already it was fading too fast. He probed further to find that blood had leaked into its brain to cause swelling. The damage was considerable.

He stepped back to consider. He might heal such damage, but what remained would hardly be worth saving.

He had an answer in his hand. He glanced down at it and then closed his eyes in a moment of respect for the majestic beast before him.

With a fluid motion, he removed its head.

At that moment, darkness reclaimed him.
