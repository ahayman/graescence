# 60 | Only a Girl [Roland]

Roland closed his eyes as he flew and felt the wind caress his face. He relished the feeling of weightlessness, as though the world had given up all the chains on his soul. The forest floor forced him to open his eyes, after which he took several long leaps and shifted his anchor, _pulled_, and propelled himself back into the air.

Half way through his arc, he cast a new anchor and used it to adjust his course around a gnarled branch of some half-dead tree that stood in the way. He landed, took a few more large steps, and _pulled_ on a new anchor he’d chosen to bring him back over the tracks he followed.

Except he’d lost them. He cast his eyes repeatedly out to find the errant prints until he spotted a broken branch behind him. He sighed in annoyance. His prey had angled away at the dead tree, and he’d been too distracted to notice.

He landed again and with a few hard steps and brought himself to a stop. He couldn’t see the tracks from this angle, but he’d seen their general direction. He cast a new anchor and _pulled_ himself in another great leap as his eyes scanned the forest floor.

His shoulder clipped a branch and spun him off into another tree, against which slammed his legs to reverse direction again. He lost all orientation until the ground came up quickly to establish a new rotation to his world. He tucked his arms, pulled in his legs, and guided himself into a semi-controlled roll.

He’d become quite good at crashing.

He groaned at the end of it but got up quickly. He spared a few moments to assess his injuries. Nothing was broken, a few new bruises for sure, but hard to tell with the so many that littered his body.

He quieted himself, evened out his breathing, and listened carefully to the woods. There were many animals here he was not ready to face yet, most of them, actually. The child inside him insisted they were monsters, but he was not so naive. Just animals, that’s all. True, animals that could rip him apart without a thought, and perhaps a few that could do it with only a thought. But still just animals.

_Pulling_ should be his biggest advantage, but he had a long way to go before it became one in truth. He still had far too many episodes like this one. Although he should probably stop closing his eyes in mid-air.

He glanced around and tried to find the trail. The grek wasn’t a difficult animal to track. It left a decent trail if you knew what to look for, and it didn’t take him long to find it. It wasn’t fresh, maybe a day or two, but he hoped it would lead to fresher trails.

He found a few potentials Whitewoods, anchored to one of them, took a few good steps for momentum, and _pulled_ himself back into the air to follow the trail below, albeit a bit more carefully than before.

The trail led up, into a part of the forest he’d never been before, and likely over into a new valley. He’d never been beyond his valley, but an anxious curiosity drove him forward just as much as the trail did. He very much wanted to see beyond and very much feared that same view.

He reached the crest and felt irritation shove his excitement aside. He was clearly at the top, yet surrounded by trees that block any view at all. He glared up at the trees, as though he might make them disappear by his will alone. Somehow, they managed to resist, but it gave him an idea.

He just needed height.

He scanned, found the tallest Whitewood he could discern, and walked a reasonable distance to help gauge where he should set an anchor. He chose a spot a little above his target branch, took a deep breath, crouched down, and then _pulled_ at the same time he lept for extra height. He squaked as his trajectory took him on a direct line to the tree’s center mass, quite a way below the bottom branch, but high enough to cause damage.

He cast out desperately for the nearest Whitewood and pulled hard to avoid it. It worked, but it was little more than twig of a sapling that creaked, then ripped up from the ground. He let go before it had an opportunity to skewer him and landed on a flat, rocky outcropping. Incredibly, he managed to land with a little slide before coming to a stop fully on his feet.

No roll, no crash, no new bruises.

He blinked, then barked out a nervous chuckle. He should be more careful. He should probably just give up the whole idea.

Also, that landing must have looked awesome.

He walked back to the same place as before and mentally chose an alternative anchor when — if — he fouled his next attempt up. He set his anchor to the tall tree a bit higher. He just needed to reach that lower branch.

He took a deep breath, crouched, and _pulled_ as he leaped, but he had overcorrected. His aim was too high, and he aborted before he gained too much elevation to safely land. Even so, he’d launched himself higher than ever, and the landing jarred him enough that he took a few minutes to recover.

He walked back again and looked around nervously. One last time and he would call it quits. Just one. He had two data points, so he was reasonably confident where the anchor should go.

He set his anchor and looked up at the tree. One breath, crouch, release it slowly, leap, and _pull_.

The wind whipped at him hard and bled his eyes of water, but he was dead on... or close. Maybe just a little low but close enough. Too late anyway to change his mind.

He wrapped himself around the branch.

Air came in short gasps as his stomach tried to reform itself after the impact. Then air came in gasps between laughs as he the idiocy of what he’d just done.

Then he started to slide.

The branch was a thick monstrosity, and it was smooth and far more difficult to gain purchase than he’d anticipated. He scratched at it and ruined nothing but his nails, yet through sheer panicked desperation, managed to climb up to safety and then scramble to the trunk.

He pressed his back against the base and slowed his breathing down. He looked down and then again slowed his breathing. It felt much higher up than it looked from the ground.

He would not give up, and he would not think about how he was going to get down. Deep breath, he could do this. Focus on the next task, anything but down.

The next branch was just beyond reach, but it overlapped the one he stood on. He had hoped he could just climb up, but the sheer size of the branch made that problematic.

But maybe if he jumped and _pulled_ on the branch. That might work. It was a stupid idea, but if he leaped before he thought about it, maybe it would work.

He leaped, then thought about it, panicked, _pulled_ harder than he should have, almost overshot the thing, but backed off enough to to once again slam himself against the branch and this time he didn’t even slide down.

Two deep breaths to calm his heart. One more to slow his mind. A few more to allow the pain in his ribs to die down. He got up and looked up at the next branch. He refused to look down again.

The next one was reachable, and the one after that. He felt a certain amount of relief that all he had to do was the very thing every boy loved: climb a tree.

He focused hard on the next branch, always the next one. He didn’t look down, he didn’t look out. He allowed nothing to distract him. Just the next branch, ever smaller, always higher until he found nothing left he was willing to traverse.

He closed his eyes for a long time. He could still go down, he could forget this whole stupid idea. He didn’t have to look. Looking meant seeing, and seeing was so much more substantial than belief.

He unclenched his jaw and looked. He almost let go as he took in one of the most spectacular views he had ever seen.

Spread out below him was the valey adjacent to his, and beyond that several others. To his right, stone had pierced the sky and sent sharp shadows from the morning sun across the valleys of lesser ridges clothed in trees. From his vantage, there was no end to the valleys and ranges that spread beyond his sight.

Never had something so beautiful assassinated hope so efficiently.

He was alone.

He knew there were no towns nearby but knew it only as a conclusion. He never saw smoke, or light bounce off the clouds, or heard anything but the forest. So, he naturally assumed there was no one nearby. But concluding allowed him hope, no matter how thin, and seeing allowed him none.

He stood on the upper branch, arm curled around the base of the tree for support as he wiped the blur from his eyes, and then the wet from his face.

It was pointless to cry. He already knew he was alone, that there was nothing around. Nothing had changed, not really, nothing but the certainty of his situation. It’s not like he hadn’t known. He had known. Now he knew. This was his life, alone with a mad immortal who sought to break him, and these hunts his only reprieve.

For a moment, just one moment, he thought to let go. It would be a simple motion, really. No effort in it at all. Just let go and escape would rush to him with no effort. He closed his eyes, clenched his jaw, white-knuckled the branch, and felt his body tremble with rage. Why couldn’t he let go?

There was no answer, no reason. It simply was, so he pushed it down. He swallowed hard, took in the view one last time, and began his descent. He’d taken up too much of the day already, and he had prey to hunt.

It took longer to climb down than it had up, of course, and perhaps stretched out by his unwillingness to look at the ground. He’d have to deal with that eventually, but eventually was not the next branch and as long as he had that, he could ignore just how high up he actually was.

The next branch became the second to last limb, and that provided an excellent opportunity to eat an early lunch and think about how to tackle this last part. He pulled out his water and set it aside, followed it with some jerky he chewed slowly, and pointedly looked out into the trees. Not down.

He had one more branch and then a whole lot of nothing before the ground. He couldn’t shimmy down the tree, especially not one so thick. He couldn’t jump or fall and expect to live, but maybe he could use an anchor to slow himself down.

He grunted. Why not? He _pulled_ himself into the air. He should be able to use it to slow himself down. The more he thought about it, the better the idea seemed until he wondered why he hadn’t used it to slow down before. It might have saved him quite a few hard landings.

He sighed, put up his food, attached his bag, and then sat another couple minutes. He was procrastinating, though that knowledge was not sufficient to get him up, but he did have prey to hunt, and he did not want to sleep in the woods.

He got up, peeked over the edge at the branch below, then shook his head at how far down it felt, much further than the jump up. But it was right below him. All he had to do was... not think about it.

He knelt, layed on his stomach, feet dangling over nothing, and allowed himself to slide off the edge.

Panic had another idea. It took control of his hands, turned them into claws, and raked what was left of his nails against the branch. He tried to tell himself that he _wanted_ to slide off the limb but then — well air, and suddenly he was flailing in freefall.

His teeth clacked as the impact of feet traveled up unbent knees into his head. He swayed off balance and then backward. He tried to grab the trunk, but it was only close enough to twist his backward fall.

He fell, then _pulled_ on instinct and slammed himself into the trunk, where he lay.

It took several seconds to register that he wasn’t falling and he didn’t die. It took a bit longer to detangle the actual sensation. It felt as though he were lying on a log, though perhaps one at an angle. The ground pulled on him, but so did the tree. So long as he kept his eyes closed, he could pretend everything was okay. He was lying down, nothing more.

He opened his eyes and pushed down vertigo as he looked out across the forest. He now lay vertical on the side of a tree several dozen paces in the air. Weird didn’t even begin to cover it.

Also, he still had a problem to solve. He couldn’t just let go of the tree. The obvious solution was to slide down the trunk, but the more he thought, the less he like the idea. He had several weapons on his back, and he didn’t trust his control enough to manage the slide.

Then he had a stupid idea, and he slowly sat up.

Well okay, that actually worked. He had to push his anchor up a little, but it worked. He stared down at the ground and decided that it was not down anymore, but a cliff instead. Down was the tree, and all he need to do was walk to the cliff in front of him. He fought vertigo as he moved the anchor up far enough to mostly cancel the earth’s pull.

With that done, he stood up. He had to move his anchor up again to keep from falling over, but it allowed him to stand on the side of a tree and look down at the ground.

No.

Not the ground, a cliff. The tree was the ground. The ground was a cliff. Tree ground, ground cliff. Deep breath and all he needed to do was walk on the tree, which was the ground.

Ever so slowly, he walked down the side of the tree and tried very hard not to think about what he was actually doing. When he was only a couple of paces off the ground, he released his anchor and belly flopped with a grunt.

He rolled over and stared back up the tree as he tried to process everything.

He had just walked down the side of a tree. That was... not like anything he ever expected to do in his life.

A small crack of a twig sat him up.

He listened but heard nothing. Nothing, mabye. He growled as he got to his feet. How stupid could he be, just lying on the ground staring at the trees. He’d allowed himself to forget just how dangerous the forest was, especially now that he was outside his valley, where monsters roamed to eat little boys.

No. Not monsters, just animals. That’s all. They were the prey, and he was the hunter.

He pushed himself to his feet, walked over to the trail, and began to follow it at a light jog. He’d wasted enough time as it was.

He settled into a rhythm. Greks were not stealthy animals so, on the whole, it was easy to follow their trail. But they did seem to travel fast enough, and by the time the sun had reached its peak, he was forced to reevaluate his options.

His tree experiment had thrown off his timing, though he doubted it mattered that much. He didn’t appear much closer to finding the animal, and he’d have to turn back now to make it home before dark. He didn’t want to sleep out here, but the idea of failure was unacceptable.

No, he’d just have to survive out here alone for a day... or two. He tried not to think about that too much.

The trees thinned out as he went, which made it both easier and harder to move. Less risk of hitting a stray branch but sometimes he couldn’t find a nearby Whitewood and had to run a bit.

Could he survive out here for several days? Rose had given him lessons on how to survive the nights after his encounter with the Jackrets, but he hadn’t yet the opportunity, or misfortune, to attempt it. He began to wonder—

Wait, is that a girl picking flowers?

With a loud crack, darkness overtook him.

He regained painful degrees of awareness to the beat of pulsing throb. He groaned far too loudly at the rhythmic ache in his face and chest.

Get distracted, run into a tree. Get distracted, and it hurts a lot. Don’t get distracted, don’t run into a tree. He repeated the mantra several times as he struggled to regain coherency. He really needed to learn that lesson.

Once the pain in his head had descended into an acceptable diminuendo, he looked over at a small field of flowers. How odd. He would have sworn he saw a girl picking flowers. Maybe he hit his head too hard. But no, that didn’t make sense... the girl was what distracted him in the first place, right?

No, he saw her. He _definitely_ saw a girl, no matter how impossible that sounded. She had flowers... he saw that, right?

He unlatched his sword and slowly made his way into the clearing. He half suspected a trap, no matter how weird it seemed, so he pushed energy into the blade and formed an edge. Feeling comforted by the weapon, he continued into the clearing.

He came across several discarded flowers near the center of the clearing. They’d been picked, so he hadn’t imagined it.

Or maybe they weren’t really there. Maybe, he hit his head harder than he’d assumed and was imagining them. He knelt down and peered at them.

They looked real.

The idea of a defenseless girl, or boy, or anyone for that matter, picking flowers in the middle of what was possibly the most dangerous forest in the world was insane. Monsters roamed here, big ones, and they ate little boys and girls.

He reached out—

“Don’t you know it’s dangerous out here?”

He jumped and spun in a sudden panic, caught his foot on something, and stumbled back down to a knee.

A girl with ebony skin stood before him. She looked to be his age, maybe, or perhaps a couple years older. She wore an odd kind of attire that appeared a single piece of patterned brown cloth that wrapped around her endlessly until it covered her body. The fabric looked nice, or would have except for the dirt... and she had a twig stuck in her black, frizzy hair. And what hair it was. It seemed to protrude out at every angle at once, creating an almost blackened halo around her head. She had a muscular build, and with her skin, she looked like she’d belong more in the islands than in the mountains. He thought she was a bit taller than him, although he couldn’t quite tell at this angle. She was older than him, he was sure, but the longer he tried to pin her age, the less confident he became. What really caught his attention, though, was her eyes. Set a deep, emerald green against her dark skin, her eyes practically danced with mirth and intelligence. He decided he liked them.

“Well, kneeling does seem appropriate.” Her tone was thick with accent and amusement.

It took him a few moments to tease apart her words but once he did he rose quickly. “What? No, that’s not—”

“Oh, it’s okay. I personally think it’s quite normal to want to kneel before such obvious greatness.”

“I tripped,” he said flatly, eyes narrowed.

“Uh huh. Do that often do you?”

“What? No.”

“The bruises on your face say otherwise.” She spoke in a taunting, sing-song voice. Then she spun around him and started picking up flowers off the ground.

He opened his mouth, but she wasn’t done.

“You know, _treewalker_, that was an impressive display you put on.” She picked up a flower and twirled it in her fingers as she gazed in languid curiosity. “So very impressive... until you face planted that is.” Her face shifted to a pitied expression as she shook her head slowly. “That wasn’t impressive or graceful.”

“You saw that?”

“So how often do you pick a fight with trees or the ground for that matter? You know, I’ve heard it said you should use your head, but maybe you took that advice too literally?”

“What?” He had trouble following her weird train of thought while trying to come to grips with... whatever this was. Nevermind finding a girl in the wood, which sounded like the beginning to some cautionary tale his mom might tell him.

“Personally, I’d use an ax but, you know, to each their own.” She wobbled her head. “Pa says we should respect other’s decisions—”

“Wait,” he said a little louder than he intended.

“Hmmm?” She turned back to pick up flowers off the ground.

“What are you doing here?”

“Really, I’d have though it was obvious. I’m picking flowers.”

“What, no, I see that. What are you doing picking flowers in the woods?”

“But that’s not really a question, is it? What I’m doing picking flowers in the woods... is picking flowers in the woods. Really, the question answers itself, doesn’t it?

He let out an exasperated breath and changed tactics. “Aren’t you afraid?”

“Of what?”

“Monsters.”

“Ooooh, yes, I’ve heard of them... but no. Pa does tell me it’s really dangerous out here, but Pa also says I missing some kind of screw, whatever that means. He doesn’t always make sense. What are you doing here?”

“I uh... I’m hunting.”

“Hunting what?”

“A grek.”

Her eyes widened comically. “Oooooh, what’s that?”

“Oh, well, it’s kind of like a large lizard.”

“You’re hunting a large lizard? You know you can find lizards just about everywhere, right?”

“No no, it’s... it’s about the size of a dog. It has sharp teeth and emits some kind of sound or gravic wave that messes with your head. Very dangerous.”

“Oh, right, those. Yeah, really annoying. They kinda squak at you, don’t they? Very loud— so you’re hunting one?”

“Yeah...”

She looked around conspiratorially and then waved him closer. He walked up to about a pace from her but refused to get closer, so she closed the distance, reached up on her toes, and whispered in his ear, “Wanna know where one is?”

“Ah.” He jumped back. “You know where one is?”

“Of course, silly. I wouldn’t offer if I didn’t know, now would I?”

Deep breath, what could go wrong? Worst case he wastes a few minutes. “Okay, where?”

“Follow me!” Again with the sing-song voice. He was starting to agree with her pa, she was a very... ah, unique person.

He pulled himself to a stop. “Wait, you can’t come.”

“Why ever not?”

“It’s dangerous, you could get hurt.”

“Ooooh, sounds fun!” she said with wide eyes, then completely changing her expression yet again, she sang, “Follow me!”

He stared at her in astonishment as she skipped toward the clearing’s edge. Skipped... who skips?

“Hey _treewalker_,” she sang, “I thought you wanted to hunt?”

He shook his head in disbelief but jogged after her anyway. Today, he’d walked down a tree and met a girl picking flowers in the woods. Could it get weirder?

He caught up to her, though he had to run faster than he thought he should. Her skip was... impressive.

“How long have you been out here?”

“Oh, three days, maybe? Or a week... year, perhaps?” She let out a weak laugh. “Honestly, who keeps track of stuff like that?”

Everyone. Literally everyone. He strongly suspected she’d been out here longer than she suggested or perhaps, longer than she realized.

“And you?”

“Huh?”

She gave him a patronizing look. “How long have _you_ been out here?”

“Uh.. oh, I don’t know.”

“Ah.”

Okay, different subject then. “What about your parents?”

“What about them? They’re my parents. You ask the oddest questions.”

She was still skipping.

“No, I mean, aren’t they worried about you?”

“Oh, ahhh... yeah, maybe? I dunno.”

Her head bobbed up and down.

“Would you please stop skipping.”

“What, why? It’s fun!”

“It’s really hard to talk when your head keeps going up and down like that.”

“If you’d just skip with me, it’d be fine.”

“_Just_,” deep breath, “please stop.”

“Oh, fine. You’re no fun... stick in the mud.”

“Thank you.”

“Oh, that wasn’t a compliment. You know why they call boring people a ‘stick in the mud’? Because it’s a stick... in the mud, and it just sits in the mud. It doesn’t do anything, just siting there in the yucky—”

“No, I mean thank you for not skipping.” Wow.

“Oh, you’re welcome.”

Though now she walked at a leisurly pace, apparently taking in the sights. He couldn’t decide whether that was an improvement. They would get nowhere at this rate, but he had serious doubts she actually knew where a grek might be. Perhaps he should doubt his own sanity—

“The first time they were furious. I mean really, really mad—” He blinked. What was she talking about? “—and the second time, and maybe the third time? They all blend together but eventually, they got used to it... I think. I mean, they keep telling me not to go, but there’s so many fun things to do out here.”

“Fun things... like pick flowers?”

“Yes. See? Fun things!”

“Okay.” Her parents had abandoned her here in frustration. It was the obvious answer.

“Besides, they give me lots of hugs and tears whenever I come home... I like that — but what about your parents, aren’t they worried about you?”

He stopped walking. “No, they died.”

“Oh, I am so sorry.”

She walked over and gave him a hug. She squeezed hard and pinned his arms to his side. Only after a time he was sure was too long, did she let go.

“Are you out here all alone?”

“No, a woman took me in and has been training me.”

“Huh, that’s weird.”

“What?”

“Most people would say she was raising you, but you say she’s training you. Is that why you’re hunting a lizard?”

“It’s a grek, and yes.”

“Hmmm... well, it’s always good to have a place you can come home to.”

Yes, it was. He wished he had one.

Rose was all he had now, but he never thought of her as his mother. Just the thought felt obscene and dirty, as though he’d soiled a precious memory.

A longing opened up inside him as forbidden, buried thoughts bubbled to the surface. His home burned down a long time ago. His mother had a hole in her now, and so did he.

“We’re here,” she said softly and looked up into his eyes. A moment of sorrow flickered in that gaze before a mischevious look took over.

Without a word, she turned and charged into the brush.

They were here? He’d been so distracted by his thoughts he didn’t really know how long they’d walked. It didn’t feel like long.

On his left was the forest and on the right, a thicket that looked to abutt against a ridge. So far as he could tell, she had charged through the bush into the ridge itself.

He stared intently at the brush. How exactly had she done that?

He shook himself out of his stupor, fed his sword, formed an edge, and before he could question his sanity, he hacked and pushed himself through the brush.

After a few minutes of this, he stumbled out into a hidden clearing. On the far side was a small opening to a cave. Over it grew a sizeable Whitewood, its roots visible and spread over the entrance. The tree had somehow embedded itself into the rockface, and yet still managed to provide excellent shade. The clearing was well used, mostly dirt, with various detritus scatted about along with the random bone.

The girl was nowhere in sight, of course, for in the center was a very large, very angry looking grek.

It was larger than a dog, much larger, more like a horse really, though perhaps with more bulk.

He blinked, no, that thing was larger than a horse. The child in him screamed monster, and for the first time that day, he agreed.

He looked around for an easy exit but saw none he could use. There were paths, but the grek must crawl under the brush or something, and his self-made trail would require a lot more hacking before he could run through it.

The grek lowered itself to the ground and approached him slowly, the way a predator might stalk a prey. It was fight or die, and he had a sinking feeling that the weird flower-picking girl had led him here to die.
