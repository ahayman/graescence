# 73 | Unexpected

Roland’s eyes snapped open into the dark. It was quiet, serene even. Winter had suffocated the life sounds of the forest into whispers that died within a stone’s throw. The silence it brought felt guarded, a sacred hush ushered under a blanket of lightless white. Ionia had passed, bereaving the forest of even that comfort, so that the early morning was nothing but still, silent, and black.

The moment didn’t exist, stuck as it was between the death of sleep and ruckus of the living. The world had paused, as it did every morning, and it was in that silent inhale of expectant breath that Roland could breathe.

It was the best time to be awake.

His skin prickled from the cold as he drew off his covers. He required neither light nor touch as he made his way to the bathroom. With a small push of energy, cold water flowed from the faucet, which he splashed on his face. It accentuated the chill and caused him to shiver, but also washed out the little sleep that still clung to him. After several splashes, he grabbed a hand towel, dried his face, and then turned back to his room.

It took seven steps to place himself center between the door and his bed, where he turned about, sat down cross-legged, and closed his eyes, though in truth, that hardly mattered in such perfect dark.

His cycle was frayed near to dissipation. It always was when he awoke, as though some animal had stolen in the night to chew and gnaw on his very essence. He was confident the nightmares caused it, but such knowledge yielded no solution. All he could ever remember of them was that something ate at him, chewed on his very soul, and tore off pieces of who he was.

So each morning, he woke early to repair the damage. To mend his soul, if only to prepare it for the horrors of the day.

His cycle had become his one anchor upon which he survived even as Rose ever escalated his training in what he considered a competition between them. She to break him, he to endure.

He did endure, somehow bearing under the pain while his body strengthened until what would bruise hardly hurt at all and what would break bone now only bruised. He no longer tired as he used to nor felt the same fatigue at the end of the day. He was faster, reacted quicker, endured longer. He woke earlier, slept less, and his mind somehow worked better. His body had become like one of the Whitewoods, impossibly strong and impervious.

Yet his scars had utterly disappeared. This he counted a loss and one he felt keenly, for it stole from him his every sacrifice and remanded them to memory alone.

And all these things he hid from her behind predatory eyes that held only cold hate. Each day was a victory that stripped Rose of her prize, twisting every day of her effort into something valuable for him.

He could see it in her eyes, the frustration and loss. She intended for him to break, be broken, little more than her puppet in the end. It gave him such pleasure to keep that from her, to take her brutality and make it his strength.

She could never know that she’d succeeded long ago.

All that was him was a facade that wrapped nothing but the empty. The facade — and her perception of it — was all what mattered. She’d broken him a hundred times, yet she would never know it, hidden as it was behind a porcelain statue carefully crafted to show her exactly what he wanted her to see.

Her pupil had learned far too well lessons she never intended to teach.

The hate ate his soul.

He was no longer sane, he was sure. Insanity had long ago slipped in under cover of pain and made a warm bedfellow. Odd that he no longer cared. It merely was a truth of his life and far from the worst one at that.

Deep breath. Hold until it burns. Release slowly.

These were futile thoughts, no matter their persistence, and they were dangerous. It was too easy to lose himself to these urges, but narrow his focus to only the task in front of him, and he could push it all out into the darkness while wringing from every small success what he needed to survive.

He first smoothed out the frayed edges and re-knit together the thousands of ends that bled out energy. It didn’t take long. He knew his cycle, understood it as a god did its own creation. Repairing it was but a matter of restoring what he knew should be. Beyond that, it was a matter of pushing the cycle into more of his body, which was more an act of creation itself, and not so easy as repairing the frayed or even the broken.

He couldn’t simply push energy wherever he wanted. His body demanded patterns, rules that must be followed for the cycle to work well. There was logic to it, of course. His mind didn’t tolerate long strands of anything, so he spiraled his cycle into unending fractals that he pushed deeper into the core of his mind. His extremities required the opposite, long interwoven threads that somehow corded together like rope. Deeper in, he had to resort to crystalline patterns, and the core of his body required a multitude of them, each unique and unending in complexity. The only pattern he hadn’t figured out yet was his skin.

The complexity was important. He could push large, simple patterns into any part of his body so long as the pattern was right. But the real benefit came from splitting the energy into ever-smaller threads, which penetrated deeper than the larger patterns ever could. More complexity took time, though, and his progress slowed more each day as he continued to refine his cycle into ever-thinning and branching steams of energy within his body.

All of this, he kept as a whole, permanent part of himself, perpetually present in his mind. Like breathing, it had rooted into a permanent part of himself. Like breathing, it took time, patience, and constant practice to do it well.

He stopped once he could see his room in the predawn light that bled in from the window. He then dressed in plain, rough spun trousers, a thick, long-sleeved shirt, and a leather vest. All his clothes were plain and yet very well made, better than anything he wore as a child, or at least much more durable. They never contained the cut or style that Rose wore, but were more than sufficient to get him through the day.

He still had no idea where she got them from or anything else for that matter. It was simply one of the many mysteries he’d come to accept as part of his world. Just as the sun would always make its inexorable journey across the sky, so would Rose have clothes and food for him. He stopped questioning it a long time ago.

He stopped at his bedroom door and relieved his knife from where it stood sentinel in the door jam. He inserted the knife in a thin, leather sheath and tucked it carefully under his trousers, clipped to the edge. Later he would don a full brace of them, but this knife he kept for himself, hidden as both a reminder and a last resort. The bloodstains, never cleaned, had stained the wood, a permanent reminder that the night of knives Rose had begun so long ago had never truly ended.

To this day, they were still trying to kill each other.

He headed cautiously down the stairs, silent and aware. She’d attacked him periodically on the way to breakfast, using the lure of morning food to slip a knife under his distracted guard. Even the sounds of her cooking were no guarantee. Every moment had to be guarded, tested, navigated. She no longer tried for blood or pain. Death was her game now.

Breakfast smelled wonderful as usual, carrying the heavy scents of spices she preferred. A taunting lure that invited repose where none could be had. Cooking was, perhaps, her one redeemable trait. He’d never tasted anything so good as what she daily set on the table.

The table had been set, so he sat down in his usual spot as she finished plating the last of the meal. She handed him his breakfast and sat down to eat silently. He glanced it, and then her. It was unusual to make it this far without even a single knife thrown. Likely another attempt to drop his guard.

Once he’d finished his meal, he almost made to rise as usual but stopped when she placed a familiar-looking binder down before him.

“Today, you hunt a linrix.”

He stared at her for a long time and refused to look down at the binder. Today was not a day for hunting. There was a rhythm to life, and this was not it. He should not hunt for at least another fortnight.

She tapped the binder slowly until he decided to look at its contents.

In it was a detailed sketch of what looked like a winged cat, although without reference, the size was uncertain. Not surprising given that most animals in the forest had a startlingly wide range of sizes. It could very well range from the size of a cat all the way up to a horse, perhaps even larger. The wings looked to have a bat-like leather membrane instead of feathers, but the finger joints looked odd. Where Roland would have expected to see a joint or claw, instead he saw a cross-section of the joint, as if part of it were cut out. Also, the wing fingers appeared to be thicker than they should be. Roland couldn’t make any sense of it. It also had decent sized claws, but so did practically everything in the forest.

“Do you see the wing joints?”

He nodded. “They look odd.”

“They fire large quills at very high velocity. It will fold its wings up over it’s head and fire up to four of its... canons, for lack of a better word. Best to think of them as such given their destructive power.”

“How long to... umm, make new quills?”

“Several minutes.”

He waited a moment to let the ridiculousness of her statement set in. “Care to be more specific?”

“It varies between sizes, but expect larger specimens to take longer.”

“What are the quills made of?” It certainly couldn’t be bone.

“I believe it secretes a set of chemicals from several glands inside the wing that, when mixed, quickly hardened into an epoxy.”

“Right—”

“Do _not_ be in front of them when it fires. Not even you can form a shield that strong.”

Roland stared at the sketch with new appreciation.

“One last thing, the Linrix can form surface shields on the outside of it’s wings.”

He gave her a startled look. He’d never encountered an animal that could form a shield aside from the jackrets, and those didn't actually qualify as shields. He’d thought the actual skill was limited to people and very few rare individuals at that.

“Now those shields can _only_ form just outside it’s wings, almost like a surface, but that does mean it can and will use those wings as shields.”

So he couldn’t just stay out of range and fire bolts at it from a safe distance when it could shield itself _and_ fire back, which meant a close-range battle. He stared at it’s claws with more appreciation.

“How big is it?”

“Like everything in this forest, it varies, so I suggest you don’t try to find the biggest specimen you can, as seems to be your habit. An average adult will be about your height at its head.”

In other words, pretty damn big. “Can it fly?”

“Sort of. It mostly uses them to glide, but it can fly on it’s own power for short distances. However, it cannot form shields _while_ it is flying and expect to remain in the air. It should mostly engage you on the ground.”

“Where?”

“South. Several valleys down, they nest with their young. The Linrix form life-long bonds with each other. You must be careful to engage only one or else you’ll find yourself fighting it and its mate at the same time. You will not survive that.”

“Okay.”

He sat back and flipped past the sketch to see the usual listing of the animal’s strengths and weaknesses. She’d included — or more likely pulled from whatever book she used — more detailed drawings of its parts, notes on its habitat, and suggestions on how to take one down.

He would ignore the suggestions. He always did. They were rarely useful and suggested whoever wrote them had little experience actually fighting creatures such as this. She was either laughably bad at hunting, or she was copying from a book he’d never seen. Given she never left their valley, he’d long ago decided it must be a book.

He flipped through the pages again and felt a sense of unease. Not only was the hunt unexpected, but the folder she gave him felt wrong. It was too light, like she’d removed information from it. He flipped through the pages a third time, rereading every note until it he realized the inconsistency.

“Where’s its other habitat?”

She looked up with guarded eyes. “Excuse me?”

“You said it mostly uses its wings to glide and that it raises its young in the valley. That means it must have another habitat, one that’s elevated.”

She pressed her lips together and leaned back, but said nothing for a minute. “It doesn’t matter. You won’t search for one there.”

“I will at least need to know how they migrate, to give me a better chance at finding only one.” It was absolutely a valid excuse. It was also a lie.

She watched him for a time, eyes narrowed. But he knew he’d won when he saw her jaw clench. “East. High in the mountains. They glide down to their nests in the valley.”

He nodded.

“Do _not_ hunt them in the mountains, Roland. There are... things there that no one can survive.”

He nodded and got up to clean his plate as his mind spun. He’d never actually been into the mountains, but he suspected she was right. Always the more powerful creatures required him to at least head east somewhat, and he’d long suspected the most powerful of them looked down from those heights.

He went to a nearby closet and removed a satchel. With a distracted motion, he stuffed it with food and supplies enough to last him several days. He then grabbed his harness and coat from the same closet. Rose watched all this from the table as she ate her own food slowly. He walked out without another word.

He swung the harness over his shoulder as he headed to the door and fed it a small trickle of power. The belt closed with an audible snap. Virtually nothing would open it again until he stopped feeding it energy.

It was something new Rose had given him recently, whatever that meant, though he’d almost lost a few weapons from a lapse of concentration. Like his cycle, it had become virtually a part of himself now.

The door protested out a squeak as he opened it, and he paused as the sound inevitably brushed a raw nerve. It was literally the only door in the house that did that.

He stuffed down the irritation and headed to the weapons rack. Mounting weapons were tricky in the winter. He hated having his sword on his hip where it could trip him, but coats made it challenging to place on his back. While he could technically put the harness over the coat, that always felt too cumbersome and awkward. So he’d settled for mounting his sword upside down on his back, where he could reach it easily. The blade barely stuck out the top at an angle.

As usual, he mounted a bolt caster on his left waist and a brace of gravtech knives on his right. A quiver of bolts went horizontally on his backside to complete the ensemble. He almost threw on his coat but stopped himself.

Rose was still inside, and she would not come to see him out. She never did, and that gave him an opportunity.

He walked to another chest that contained more mundane equipment and rooted through it until he found what he needed.

The two picks were plain-looking gravwood, but they would do better than any metal ever could. They were awkwardly shaped enough that he couldn’t attach them to his harness without sacrificing one of his weapons, which he would not do. So instead, he secured them with one of the straps on his pack and let them dangle. Not great, but it would have to do.

He put on his coat last, made some last adjustments, and threw his bag over his head. Once he was satisfied the picks wouldn’t trip him, he walked eastward into the forest, toward the stream which was likely frozen by now. Once out of sight, he _pulled_ and rocketed himself in a south-east direction, aimed directly at the mountains.
