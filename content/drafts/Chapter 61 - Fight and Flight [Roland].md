# 61 | Fight and Flight [Roland]

Roland’s breath came quick and shallow. He had prepared for dog-sized, not this horse-sized monstrosity. He had no idea how he was supposed to beat this thing, but it was clear by its aggression that only one of them would come out alive.

He took a deep breath and slowed his thoughts.

The grek hadn’t attacked yet, likely taking stock of its enemy... or prey.

He looked around and spotted quite a few Whitewoods, all of them mature. He could use those trees to move quickly. He wasn’t sure if it had a mate nearby, but he saw no one else. It had quite a few scars on its body, suggesting it had fought off plenty of rivals... and now he was giving second thoughts to how quickly he could evacuate the area.

Maybe it wouldn’t actually chase him through the bush?

No, stupid idea.

He was given no more chance as the grek had concluded he would make an excellent meal and quickly advanced. He should have moved, waved his sword, or done something, anything to defend himself. Instead, he stood there with a shell-shocked look on his face.

The Grek stopped a few paces short, raised its head, and opened its mouth.

He knew what came next. Rose had prepared him for it. While she claimed she could stop the grek’s attack, her advice to him was to simply not be in its aim.

With this in mind, he cast around to find a tree he could anchor and pull from, but it was too late. There was no way for him to dodge the — rock?

A rock hit its head. Well, that was unexpected.

It didn’t do much, except cause the grek to snap its head about in astonishment. Clearly, there were only two of them in the clearing. Clearly, something had thrown the rock but try as it might, it saw nothing but Roland, who was just as confused as the grek.

The girl? But he couldn’t see her. Rocks don’t usually just fly around randomly. They looked at each other in confusion for a moment.

The grek lunged.

He’d already anchored to a tree on his right, just slightly behind the beast. He _pulled_ and brought his weapon to bear on its face.

Quick, easy, and clean was always the best way to end a hunt.

It moved quicker than he thought possible, abandoned its lunge, and swiped its front paw at him, complete with razor-sharp claws.

It didn’t even have to do much. He practically _pulled_ himself through that paw and raked deep gashes into his arm. He dropped the sword and continued on to tumble to the ground some distance away.

He stood up quickly and looked at his arm. Two deep gashes trailed almost the full length of his forearm. He closed his fist and watched the blood pulse from the wounds. His hand felt weak, but that was all. He had expected pain, a lot of it, but so far it just felt weird... almost as though his body hadn’t figure out what to do with it.

The grek hissed and lunged again.

He dodged into a roll and came to his feet a pace from its head. Its teeth had missed him by inches. He jumped over the paw in an attempt to flank it, but it swung its tail and batted him away, hard.

Sky and earth traded places repeatedly before he crashed into the thicket. Getting up proved painful as he disentagled himself from the thick brush. His chest throbbed where it had hit him, but he had no trouble breathing, so nothing broken at least.

The grek had repositioned itself between him and his sword but made no further move to attack, which meant it clearly understood both the threat and the lure his weapon represented. He had to get that weapon, and it had every intention to use that against him.

He rushed forward and earned only a light snort from the animal for his insanity. At a few paces away, he lept directly at it. It flinched back in surprise, then snapped forward to take the meal he’d so willingly offered.

He _pulled_ on an adjacent tree he’d anchored to and yank himself out from its mouth. The beast’s jaw snapped shut with an audible crack.

He followed with a hard _pull_ on his next anchor, this one behind the Grek, to angle himself at his weapon. His aim was good, but it swung its tail around and forced him to pull on his first anchor to dodge it. That sent him flying back into the thicket.

He pushed himself up and disentangled himself from the thorny brush. He had a thousand small cuts and his arm had started to throb. The grek repositioned itself, and again it stood between him and his only hope of defeating the thing.

He rushed it but then lept and _pulled_ himself far above the beast. He couldn’t get around that tail, but perhaps he could fly over it. For a moment, he thought it would work until it raised up on its hind legs and translated its long body into a height that dominated the clearing.

He tried to yank himself out of the way, but it had already swiped at him. Its foot struck his shoulder and sent him flying back out into the thicket... again. He was really starting to hate the stuff. At least he’d missed its claws.

It took him precious moments to push through the thicket. By the time he broke free, the grek was positioned in front of his sword.

It raised its head up and opened its mouth to attack.

He cast around for an anchor, but he was too far back. The cone of its attack would be larger and the effect less pronounced, but he doubted that would matter much. If it caught him, he was as good as dead.

He anchored and readied himself to _pull_ but— rock? Again and bigger this time. The grek actually stumbled.

Huh. Either the rocks here were oddly prone to flight, or that girl was somewhere in the clearing.

The grek spun and weaved its head back and forth to look for the attacker. It seemed to have forgotten Roland completely. He didn’t believe that, not really, but it’s back was to him, and he couldn’t help but feel a little miffed that it dismissed him as irrelevant. Not that he could do much without his sword, but still.

It raised its head and emitted its gravic attack into the bushes. Even outside its aim, he stumbled and brought his hands to his head from unexpected vertigo. He could almost visually see the waves emit from its mouth. Where the waves crossed, any small twigs or brush present twisted and cracked.

He realized then that where a smaller grek might disorient, this one would most certainly scramble the brain completely, with death the best result.

Despite the impressive attack, nothing happened. No girl spilled out of the thicket, no enemy revealed itself.

The grek shook itself, snorted, and stomped in agitation. It took a step forward, turned, and released another attack just off angle to it’s original.

Still nothing. If that girl was out there, she was really good at hiding, or dodging, or both... or something.

Whatever was happening, it was a good distraction. His sword was under its tail as it swung back and forth in agitation.

He crept around the back, careful not to draw attention to himself. He couldn’t approach his sword without risking the tail, but the seed of a plan had sprouted in his mind.

Another rock flew at the creature, but he still couldn’t see the girl. It almost appeared as though the stone had been conjured from thin air.

The grek hopped and turned to line up its next attack. Roland had placed himself behind it, which lined up himself, the grek, his sword, and, most importantly, a large Whitewood.

He hesitated at the incredibly stupid thing he was about to do. But doing crazy things seems to be the theme of the day.

Deep breath, don’t think, release it slowly.

The grek let out another impressive wave attack.

He dropped to the ground, feet angled toward the Grek, anchored to the tree, and _pulled_. Gravity shifted to the tree and pulled him down the clearing, toward the grek in a slide. It was so intent on finding its new attacker, it had completely forgotten him.

Roland couldn’t help but smile as he snatched up his sword under its tail and poured energy into it. He slid under the beast and brought the sword up into its underbelly. He sliced it from the base of its tail to the bottom of its neck, then shot out from under it, let go of his anchor, and used the momentum to roll back to his feet.

The Grek had its mouth open for another attack, and its eyes wide in surprise.

It tried to take a step forward but stumbled as blood and entrails evacuated its body.

It was weak and exposed, and for that, he felt anger.

He ducked under, spun, and slashed its leg with a vicious cut, deep enough to cause pain but not so deep as to sever it completely.

It mewled out a pathetic sound that made him smile.

He moved quickly and sliced its nose as he shifted to the other side. It tried to follow him, but the pain had blurred its reality. It moved slow, and its actions were all defensive. He had no difficulty ducking under the languid head.

He clipped its other leg and felt another surge of satisfaction as it rolled over onto its side, dragging its entrails through the dirt to dangle. Seeing exposed entails loosely hanging down its side, he began systemically slicing them off as he relished in the pitiful noises it made in response.

“_What_ are you doing?”

Her tone sliced through the haze of his mind.

He glanced down at himself, then his sword, and finally the beast before him. Its breath was labored, and its hind legs twitched from the pain. A flush of heat caused him to stumble back a step as the truth of what he’d done crashed into him.

Anger and rage disentegrated into guilt.

He’d he enjoyed it, craved it. The creature’s suffering had felt like vindication, like justice, but that now clashed with disgust.

He closed his eyes against the conflicting emotions and then walked over to the girl. He caught a glimpse of motion and on instinct pivoted on his heal as the grek lifted its head for one final vengeance. He took two steps forward and in a single swipe removed its head from its body.

It was what he should have done in the first place.

He stared at the head for a moment and then giggled in relief. Guilt slammed down the giggles, but adrenaline brought them back up again with force only a few moments later. He was verging on full blown laughter when he was rudely interrupted.

“Are you ok?”

She bore an expression so discordant with his own polarized insanity that he had to blink himself out of the unreality of it all.

He looked over at the grek with a confused frown. “I... didn’t mean to do that.”

“I can see that,” she said in a quiet voice.

He looked back at her and expected condemnation but saw only pity.

Her eyes flicked to the grek in alarm.

“What?”

“It never finished its attack, and unfinished gravic attacks always—”

A massive gravic wave exploded from the Grek.

While it wasn’t an attack, per se, it pushed both Roland and the girl back with such force that they both tumbled over several times before stopped by the surrounding thicket. It was several moments before either of them moved.

“—explode... I was going to say explode.”

He slowly got back on his feet and wavered a little as he looked around. The Geck’s body had been displaced, but the head hadn’t moved at all. Odd, and despite the girl's description, the body looked wholly intact, minus the head of course.

“When a beast collects gravic energy for an attack, you always want to wait until after the attack to kill it.”

“Why would I do that?”

“Really? You can’t figure this out?”

He looked over at the Grek as he chewed on his cheek. “Oh, well, how was I supposed to know that?”

“You’re the hunter, aren’t you?”

“Well, yeah but—”

“So how can you not know that?”

He threw up his hands. “Hey, it’s ok, it’s done now.”

“No, no it is _not_ done now.”

“What do you mean? It’s dead.”

“Yes, _it_ is dead, but you just announced to everything nearby that something juicy is here... right here, right where you’re standing.”

He felt increasingly uncomfortable and exposed while the girl glared at him. It really was quite remarkable how she shifted from a happy-go-lucky girl who collected flowers to this—

“What? Stop glaring at me. I didn’t know.”

“I’m deciding whether to help you live or not and yelling at me won’t help.”

“I. didn’t. know— wait, what do you mean ‘help me live’?”

“Yes, let’s yell even louder so the big scary monster can find and eat you.”

“Ummm... what monster?”

“Wyrm.”

He blinked, then shifted his weight under her glare. He waited another minute, but she simply looked on him with an imperious glower.

“Uh, so... what exactly is a Wyrm?”

She huffed. “Are you sure you’re not just some boy with a wooden sword? Big long snake with wings... scary, white thing?” He blinked. “Ugh, a dragon, it’s a type of _dragon_. You’re barely a snack to it.”

He swallowed hard and scanned the sky. Nothing, but somehow that made it worse.

“Maybe it didn’t notice?”

“Oh, it noticed.”

“And why are you so calm if it's such a scary monster?”

Her anger melted before a mischevious smile, which was unnerving at best. “Turns out, they can’t eat what they can’t see.”

She hadn’t finished speaking when the light around her bent. It turned in on itself over and over again until it seemed to split her from the middle out, leaving nothing left of her to see.

He completely forgot the dreaded dragon and blinked several times as he questioned his sanity. The girl had twisted herself out of reality itself, completely gone no matter where he looked.

That’s not normal, that’s really not normal.

“Your expression of awe has convinced me. I’ve decided to help you, but you must follow me and do exactly what I say.”

He jumped and looked around frantically. Her voice was nothing less than that of a goddess, or goddesses. Her voice was distorted and came at him at slightly different times from multiple directions. The unnerving weirdness had just hit a new level.

He looked over to the dead lizard and half expected to find that it too had vanished. But no, it was still there. Only the girl had disappeared.

He was sane, right, this was real? There was a grek there, and he’d killed it. But there were flying rocks from nowhere, a flower-picking girl who could disappear and had questionable sanity and sometimes sounded like a goddess.

That all happened— was happening. Just accept it. If he were insane, it wouldn’t matter anyway.

“Okay, but where are we going?”

“I said, follow me, not question me.”

He felt a sudden, strong need to leave without her, to be anywhere she wasn’t.

No, that’s not right.

He felt a strong need to get back to Rose with his kill. She’d sent him out, and there were only a few hours left in the day. Too few. Even if there weren’t a great dragon coming to eat him, he wouldn’t make it back before dark. The prospect of disappointing her was a worm in his belly.

Anger solidified into obstinate defiance. He would go with the girl.

“Yes, fine. Let’s go.”

He felt a little weak, and the pain in his arm had increased. He glanced down to see a decent-sized pool of blood at his feet with more dripping off his hand.

At the same spot she disappeared, the light bent and twisted until it revealed the girl standing in the same place she was before. She hadn’t moved at all, just reappeared, warping herself back into reality.

“That’s—”

“Amazing?”

“Uh, sure.”

“Well, I think so.”

The goddess had fled and left the same weird girl he’d seen before. A flower-picking girl that twisted reality, turned invisible, and sometimes turned into an angry goddess.

It left him feeling confused and dizzy. Perhaps he wasn’t sane, but it didn’t seem so important as it had a minute ago.

She tried to walk away. “Wait,” he called out after her.

He walked over to the recently decapitated head, picked it up, and fumbled with it as he figured out how to hold it with only one arm.

“Are you kid—”

He threw up a hand.

The head was far too large for his bag, but maybe he could tie it somehow to his harness. He rummaged around his bag for some rope and tried several ways to secure the head. The thing was massive, of course, and an awkward shape, but after a few minutes he managed to get it reasonably secured to his back. He stumbled a little from the weight.

The girl was apoplectic by this point. Her mouth worked words in silence as she stared at him with an incredulous look, to which he replied with a half shrug. He needed the head for proof, or he’d just end up doing the same hunt over again, and that was simply unacceptable.

She stormed to the edge of the clearing and walked through the bush... just walked.

It was impossible.

He tried to follow, but where she walked, he had to push and struggle. The thicket reached out at every opportunity to snag, catch, and hinder every move he made.

At the same time, it bent away from her as she walked through as though it were little more than a well-trod path. And whatever she was doing, it corrected itself as soon as she passed.

His progress lagged behind hers as he slashed, pushed, and grunted his way through the thicket. By the time he pushed through the last of it, she had been waiting for several minutes, impatiently by the look on her face.

His own mood had soured, and he returned her an acid look.

She rolled her eyes at him, turned, and trotted down the path, forcing him to run to catch up while his head spun.

At least she wasn’t skipping.

“So where is it?” He was panted heavily as he stumbled on an unseen rock.

“How should I know?”

“You seemed to know a lot about—”

“I know enough to stay away. We’re in its territory, but it won’t attack unless it’s hunting you, or if you somehow make yourself known... like, say, setting off a gravic bomb.”

She was moving quickly now, far quicker than he thought a girl her size should, while he barely managed to keep pace as he stumbled along beside her.

“This is its hunting ground, and you basically poached its territory. It will search for a long time to find you.”

“What about you?” The road twisted and bucked, making it all but impossible for him to keep his feet on it.

“Oh, it’ll never know I’m here. Not too much futher now.”

That was good. His head felt light, and his vision blurred. He glanced down to see a steady stream of blood running down his arm. It pulsed out rapidly with each heartbeat. He looked back and saw a regular trail of blood staining the road. It seemed like a lot.

“I’m not sure I’ll make it.” His word blurred as the world twisted and spun.

He chuckled to himself. He’d made the world twist like she does.

“What— oh!”

“Just need rest...”

He stared at the sky. He couldn’t recall why he’d laid down, or even how, but the clouds were pretty.

Specs of black turned to locusts, and they slowly consumed the light. It should be ominous, but he was becoming more distracted by a deep cold that had settled in his body, a cold that felt oddly familiar. The last thing he saw was her face as the plague consumed the last of the light.

“You’ll be safe, I’ve got you now.”
