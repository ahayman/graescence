# 6 | Descent [Dia]

"Right."

Dia stared at the cracks in her best friend's mask. Her mind kept grasping for words to make it better, but unlike tech, she had no secret gift that would tell her how to fix people.

She always relied on Kalina for that.

Her eyes turned to the fan, focusing beyond them to access the tunnel she knew was down there.

"You um..." She turned to Kalina, forcing confidence into them. "you have a cinch in your pocket. Tait's?"

"Mm-hmm."

Kalina pulled out the cinch, not questioning how Dia knew was there. She handed over a set of conjoined rings of carved elderin. Dia took the device in hand, exchanging it for the light in hand.

"How does this work, anyway? Doesn't look like it would hold."

Dia blinked at her. Kali normally didn't care how things worked, only that they did.

"Hemp reacts to graescence." She picked up the rope, running her fingers over the velvet. "It can even conduct it, although it's a poor conductor."

"What happens to it?"

"Happens to what?"

"The energy. It has to go somewhere, right? You told me that once, energy can't just disappear. So, where does it go?"

"I didn't realize you listened."

Kali's face flattened. "Of course I do."

The scuffle of a foot against stone followed by soft cursing drew their eyes to the ladder. Tait was working his way down with jerky, angry movements. Malek's butt hung in the air, legs swinging as he tried to find a foothold.

"Right, guess the coup failed." Dia turned back to Kali. "Sorry. It ah, bends the space around it."

"Really?"

She shrugged. "It's nothing you can see. Space bends, but not easily, and especially not from a rope like this—too unstructured. It'd be easier to create a field warp."

Kali's eyes turned blank. "Ah, of course... a field warp."

"Oh, it's something that happens when you try to press your graescence out with nowhere to go. Like the rope, the energy still has to do something, so it bends space. The military uses it to figure out how strong a soldier's graescence... is..."

And just then, Dia realized that she was not, in fact, humoring her best friend, but being humored instead. Kali's lips quirked up into a lopsided smirk, the same she always wore when Dia finally caught up.

"...right." At least the dynamics of their relationship had remained firmly in place. A comfort, that.

Dia straddled the fan blades and shuffled her way toward the center until the blades were narrow enough to reach around. She eyed the blades, lining up the one she needed, and wound the rope around it once.

While she shuffled back, the others lined themselves along the ledge. Malek, having drawn the inevitable and obvious conclusion from the rope, gave Dia a mildly incredulous look that she studiously ignored.

Tait pressed himself against the wall, looking askance at the turbine as though it was a moment away from jumping up and gobbling him up. The man-child's entire conception of danger was limited to what he could see. Infuriating. Dia held her tongue for Kali's sake.

Once safely on the ledge, Dia unwound the rope and threaded both ends through opposite sides of the cinch. Once she'd pulled the entirety of the rope through, she fed it enough graescence to hold for several hours. The rope responded to the graescent fields, locking themselves in place.

"What happens if the fan turns on?" Malek asked in an overly casual tone.

"It spins," she paused, then amended, "fast."

"Right, of course, makes sense. So, what exactly would happen if someone were— oh, I dunno—say, hanging from a rope when that happens?"

"Anyone, in particular, you have in mind?" She glanced at Tait.

"Nope, no one. I mean, I certainly wouldn't want to be hanging out there when that happens."

Dia nodded. "Yeah, we don't want to breathe Malek juice."

Kalina winced. "Eww..."

"I vote we go now," Moore said, his bass voice echoing, "before the death fan turns on."

Kalina snorted at the name but nodded her agreement.

"Death fan?" Malek turned to him. "How about blades of liquefication?"

"That's not a word," Dia said in a patronizing tone. "It's liquefaction."

"Really? Doesn't sound right."

"You mean to liquefy, right?"

"Yeah."

"Then it's liquefaction."

"You sure?" Malek looked doubtful.

"Yes."

"What about blades of aeres... uh" Kalina twisted her lips, "huh, aere-sol-i-zation? Is that a word?"

Dia blinked at her. "No."

"Horrible name," Malek agreed.

"Fine. Blades of death?"

"Boring."

"How about—"

"You guys are crazy," Tait rudely interrupted. "You know that, right?"

They ignored him.

"Fine," Moore said, "can we go now before The Blender turns on?"

Kalina laughed. "Oh oh oh, I like it! The _Blender_. Has a ring to it."

Dia nodded. "Blender it is. Good job Moore. I knew we kept you around for a reason."

Moore grunted.

"Are we really going to stand around and name the trap?" Tait whined.

They slowly turned to him. Even Moore twisted his face up.

"That's not a trap, Tait," Kalina said slowly. "It's a fan."

Tait did not look like he believed her.

"Fine, I'll go first..." Dia said, then mumbled, "as usual."

She took back the light from Kalina, grabbed the rope, wrapped it around her shoulder and through her crotch, and then began to carefully slide herself between the fan blades. She held herself at the blade's lower edge, legs dangling in the dark. Her light bounced off the blades and the wall and nothing else. Her heart began to race.

_Maybe this was a mistake..._

"You gonna go!?" Kalina's voice came distant, muffled by Dia's breath, which made the confined space feel hot and pressing.

"I'm going, I'm going!"

_One, two, three and—_

She let go of her death grip on the rope but friction wouldn't allow her to simply slide down. No, that would be too easy. Instead, she had to scooch herself, little by little as more and more of her dangled over nothing.

Without warning, friction gave up and she was falling.

She clamped down on the rope, burning her hands. The momentum left her in a pendulous swing, back and forth, almost comforting if she closed her eyes and tried very hard to forget where she was.

_Down. Just..._ she steadied her breath.

Curses filtered down from above.

"Can't see a thing!"

"Hold on." Tait sounded impatient and annoyed.

_Don't look down; go down. Let go, but only a little, and ignore that gaping hole beneath you just waiting to swallow you whole and...oh gods, I'm really bad at self-motivation._

"You have a _light?_" Kalina yelled suddenly, "and you couldn't be bothered to pull it out before now?"

"No," the tone spoke of finality. "No, I couldn't."

_And isn't that odd?_ But she had a more pressing matter to attend to. Like letting go of the death grip she had on the rope.

She let go, yelped, squeezed, burned her hands, then came to a stop. She swung back and forth while very carefully slowing her breathing.

Terror had a new flavor. Dangling by a thread over a maw of suffocating darkness. What had once been expansive, constricted around her.

_Okay. Now...just do that about a hundred more times._

She descended in spurts, falling then catching. Bouncing off the wall with her body more than her feet. She kept her eyes on the rope, the walls...anything but down.

_Rappelling. It's called rappelling. People do it all the time._ Everyone did it better than she did.

But she did it, slowly. She reached four floors downs, almost the rope's end, and stared at the access panel she'd aimed for... only four paces away.

_Oh... okay. Right, only a slight miscalculation. It's fixable. I just need to—_ she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to slow her breathing down before giving up. _Oh for the love of forsaken gods, just swing dammit!_

She placed her feet on the wall at an angle and took another deep breath. A half launch slipped into a half swing, twisting around the rope. She let out a loud squawk the darkness ate readily.

_Are the walls getting smaller? They feel like they're getting smaller._

The finger-sized indentation to open the panel was on the far side, forcing her to bounce herself off the wall twice before she had enough momentum to reach it.

_Got it, got it, got— NO!_ She cried to herself as she missed the indentation.

And then missed again on the second try. Then again on the third.

Finally, she fed the graetech enough for the panel to slide open.

"Alright... okay," she said, breathing heavily, "now just need to go... in the dark hole."

She couldn't decide which was worse: dangling over nothing, one slip away from death; or being suffocated inside a tunnel.

She opted for suffocation.

One good kick launched her off the wall before she could think about it, restoring her pendulous momentum.

And then, in a fit of monumental stupidity, she let go of the rope and latched on the edge of the hole. She immediately began sliding, her feet flailing against the wall. The light slipped from her fingers, sputtering out as she instinctually clawed at the stone. She kicked and scrambled in the black, desperately scratching at the stone until she'd somehow clawed herself into the access shaft.

_Never. Again._

She felt around for the light and fed it a surge of adrenaline-fueled graescence. She hugged it close to her chest as it burst it's radiance in a valiant effort to drive back the darkness.

_I'm so sorry little light. I won't leave you ever again, I promise. I'll keep you safe, just... just don't go out._

Tait came down next, pale and sweaty when he grabbed hold of Dia's hand and almost pulled her out of the tunnel as he panicked. He did not have his light.

Malek followed, though halfway down he yelled out, "Light!"

Dia blinked slowly, then sheepishly shoved her light to Tait. "Um, just stick your arm out."

Tait's mouth dropped but held his tongue as he slowly took the light from her. He stuck his arm out and glared at her.

Moore followed Malek, then came Kalina, who was holding Tait's light and appeared to be in no hurry to return it.

Both Dia and Malek suddenly had the same panicked thought.

"Don't let go—"

"—of the rope!"

Kalina screwed up her face at them. "I'm not stupid, guys." She looked at Tait. "You have anything for this?" She waived the rope around.

He stared at the rope.

"Hmm, maybe," he said with the reluctance of someone offering a precious heirloom to a child. He slung the pack off his shoulder and began to dig through it.

Dia angled her head to see inside, but he caught the movement and shifted his back to block her. She glared at him.

"Here." Tait pulled out a piece of elderin carved tech and handed it to Kalina.

"How do you use this thing?" Kalina asked, turning over what appeared to be a simple wooden spike with a fat rounded end.

"There's an indentation on the side," Dia said absently, still staring at Tait's pack. "Just feed it." She'd caught a hint of coherence when he dug into it.

"Maybe not over your leg," Tait said, cinching his pack and blocking Dia's view.

Dia looked up. "Oh yeah, don't do that. It'll go through your leg quicker than it will stone."

Kalina froze, then slowly moved the device away from her leg.

"Point down on the stone, _then_ feed it." Dia corrected.

Tait gave her a confused look, likely expecting to have to explain everything. He didn't, and Dia could see the wheels turning in his head, trying to tease out the reason why.

_Too many clues. He's going to figure it out...well, maybe._ The traits of the gifted were mostly a known quantity, but Dia's gift was not among them.

Kali set the point on the floor of the tunnel. She concentrated for a moment. Suddenly, the spike slammed into the stone, sending a cloud of pulverized dust into the air.

Everyone jumped at that, even Tait.

She stared at the spiked anchor, then at the rope. She frowned. "I don't think..."

"Just touch the rope to it," Dia said.

The rope snapped to the anchor when Kali got it close enough.

"Should last a few hours," Dia said and then began crawling down the tunnel immediately, trying very hard to ignore the walls collapsing in on her. She was getting very sick of small, dark spaces.

The group followed her in silence. No jokes, none of the usual cutting sarcasm, not even gallows humor. No small part of that was due to how quickly Dia scuttled down the tunnel, very much as though she were being chased.

Just like the last tunnel, an access door guarded the entrance. Dia shoved graescence into the feeder.

She spilled out into a dusty room filled with detritus, just like the others.

Dia's heart fell into her stomach. "Shit."
