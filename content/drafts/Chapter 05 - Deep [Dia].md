# 5 | Deep [Dia]

Dia knelt before constraining walls encompassing an umbra that corroded her light. She pressed graescence into her lamp, pushing the light further.

It was not enough, not even close.

She compelled her breath into an even cadence, muscles into stillness. Fists relaxed, neck stiff, back rigid.

"Is she alright?" Tait's voice drifted distantly.

"Shush, just give her a minute."

Fear tasted unfamiliar, like an old friend wearing the wrong face. Cotton stuffed her mouth and dried the tongue. Muscle stiffened under tremors of pressure, begetting shallow breath.

Beyond the light roamed murderous bots and hidden death traps, yet she feared neither. It was the tunnel. It loomed before her, the menacing visage of an untouchable monster made of smothering darkness. Every part of her screamed that it would swallow her whole and leave her to die, suffocating within the embrace of cold granite.

Dia crawled into the monster's maw before fear overcame her greed.

"Tait, you're next," Kalina ordered, "if she dies, you'll follow—"

"Wait, what?"

"—then me, Malek, and Moore."

"Why do I have to—"

"Just _go_ Tait," Malek's voice rose in irritation, "or do you like standing around in the dark?"

The rasping shuffle of cloth on stone betrayed Tait's advance down the tunnel, offering the comfort of some company while impeding escape. She swallowed paste down a dry throat, driving forward with a slow, inexorable pace that hardly remained a step beyond her bourgeoning panic.

She slowed as she approached the bend, her heart counter-pacing her caution. Little by little she crept forward until the passage beyond revealed nothing but more darkness.

_Nothing? That's...that's not right, there should be something..._ some excuse to turn around and abandon this half-baked impulse to court death.

"Must we go so slow?" A pettish voice sounded from behind.

"Tait," Kali replied in a maternal tone, "we'll go as slow as it takes to not die if that's okay with you."

Tait scoffed, yet refrained from further comment.

Dia increased her pace, driven as much by the pressing walls as by the lack of instant death nearby. The sound of her breath and rustling clothes filled the space, both growing louder with every passing minute.

"Dia?"

Moisture abandoned her mouth to escape through every pore. Sweat dripped from her nose, tapping on the algid stone and leaving a trail of splatters.

"_Dia?_"

Her panting escalated to the pace of her heart, and her haste hounded it like a rabid dog.

"Hey, slow down!"

Pressure built in her head, blood pushing into her eyes, throbbing into branches of red across her vision. The walls squeezed in, and her crawl turned into a desperate scrambling as she clawed her way through the tunnel.

_One feed panel, leading to double rails._

She almost cried out in relief as she shoved herself at the tunnel's end. Graescence flowed from her into the panel, causing it to slide out of the way. Cool air and empty darkness greeted her, inviting her into a spacious void.

A half lunge met with nothing. She pitched over an edge she'd been too addled to notice, dangling precariously as her fingernails scoured the granite in an attempt to arrest her momentum.

She scrabbled herself back into the tunnel and pressed herself into the walls. Adrenaline drove her breath ragged and shallow. Shivers ransacked her body.

A hand appeared within the sphere of light surrounding her. Dia snatched it up as she would a lifeline in hell.

Kalina folded a second hand over, enveloping Dia's grip with a warm embrace. Dia let her head fall back against the stone and closed her eyes. They sat in silence while her heart and breath slowed in small increments.

Angry whispers drew her out of a realm where stone conspired to squeeze her into a vacuous fall. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly before opening her eyes.

Tait snarled whispers at Malek. The lanky boy shook his head slowly, whispering something Dia couldn't hear. Tait scoffed before leaning against his pack. He caught her gaze and met it with a flat expression.

Kali squeezed her hand. "You okay?"

She shrugged, not trusting her words.

Tait painted a false smile. "We can go back if you're not up for—"

"No." Dia shuddered. "I..." _would rather jump off a cliff than go back through that tunnel._

She tried again, summoning steel into her voice. "Thank you, Kali, I'm fine. We need to figure _that_ out." She gestured toward the void.

"What is it?"

Dia's lip twitched. "A very large hole."

"Yes, thank you. I can see that. Where does it go?"

"Down." Dia leaned out and arced her neck. "And up."

"Wow, you are full of insight."

Dia painted a smile and forced out a chuckle, but the artificial sound made a mockery of laughter. She gave up when Kalina scrunched up her face in pity. Kali reached over and patted her hand.

Dia snatched her hand back and glared at her friend, who met her eyes with amusement.

Dia rolled her eyes, sighing. She leaned out of the tunnel and pushed graescence into the lamp. The extra light gave shape to a circular room. Far below slotted shadows radiated outward from a central point. She took a deep breath and flooded the lamp with as much graescence as she could manage. The light burst into blinding brilliance, revealing dozens of angled fan blades far below them.

Kalina wiggled herself beneath Dia's arm until her head peaked out.

"Is that a fan?"

Dia retracted herself into the tunnel, gasping for breath while her head swam from the effort. The light died down until it barely lit the tunnel.

"You alright?"

Dia leaned against the wall and blinked away the stars swimming in her eyes.

"Yeah, cheap-ass light."

Kalina scrunched up her face. "Not _that_ cheap. We spent half our money on it."

Dia shrugged and shoved the lamp at her.

"You feed it then."

Kalina took it, then leaned out over the pit again. The light sprang into a half-hearted brilliance.

"So what's the deal?" Malek said from behind them.

"Fan," Kalina replied.

"...a what?"

Dia flattened a look at her. "Now who's full of insight?"

"Sorry," she huffed, "A _big ass_ fan. Better?"

Dia rolled her eyes. "It's an air shaft."

Tait looked at them. "That means it leads somewhere, right? Like other floors?"

"Maybe," Dia said. "We'd need rope."

"Oh." Tait began pulling off his pack.

Dia leaned back out and took note of numerous protrusions ringing the walls at regular intervals. Between them ran vertical filament of woven elderin, the wood humming in her mind with energy. She looked up and saw the protrusions were scoops seamlessly formed from the stone, funneling air into wide slits barely a hand thick. Four rings of them marked the floors between them and the fan, wedged halfway between floors four and five. No access panels other than their own marred the tunnel.

Kalina wedged her head out again, practically through Dia's armpit. "Watcha think?"

"If there's access to another floor, it's below the—oh wait, those aren't vents." Dia inched out further for a better view of holes carved directly beneath them. "That's a ladder."

She pulled both of them back into the tunnel.

"Here." Tait pulled out a blood-tinted rope.

A still silence descended on the group as everyone took in the silky fiber woven in on itself.

Dia frowned. "Is that Elderhemp?"

"Crush the delve," Malek breathed out, "why don't we just sell the rope instead?"

"Try it," Tait snorted, "see where that gets you."

Kalina cocked her head. "And where exactly would that get us?"

Tait pressed his lips together in a mulish expression.

"We should go back," Malek grumbled. "This whole thing smells."

"No!" Dia said louder than she'd intended. "No, let's at least see if we can get to another floor."

"I agree," Kali backed her up. "We _need_ this delve."

Dia's brow creased, caught on an edge she felt in her best friend's tone, a whisp of desperation. Dia looked again, noticing lines of stress around her eyes and tension in her shoulders. They'd been on over a dozen delves together and never had she seen Kali look so stressed.

_It's not the tunnel. She needs this delve as much as I do... but why?_

"How far down is that fan?" Malek asked Dia, breaking the silence.

Dia broke away from Kali. "Four floors, why?"

"So, he wouldn't die if we pushed him?"

"No," Dia shook her head a genuine laugh escaped her lips, "not far enough. He might break his legs though, and the fan would take care of the rest when it turns on."

"Hey Tait," Kalina smiled at Tait, "trade places with me?"

"You're not funny."

Her smile fell. "If we're going to do this, you can't hold back on us, not on the lower floors."

"I got out the rope, didn't I?"

"It's going to take a lot more than rope."

"I"m not..." Tait hesitated.

"You're not what, _Tait_?" Dia asked, voice laden with irritation. "You came to us, remember? You asked to join us. And then you show up with a pack full of tech and refuse to help?"

"How would you know... no, that's not—Fine," He growled and flipped his hand. "_If_ we need something, I'll get it out, but I'm not opening my pack for you to rummage through."

"Fine," she mimicked his tone, "just stop being dead weight."

Tait snarled something unintelligible, then bit off his reply.

"So ah," Malek interrupted the glaring, "what about the fan?"

Dia gave him a blank look. "What about it?"

"I... don't want to die?"

She shrugged. "I'll know before it turns on," _Probably. Maybe,_ "and that thing is huge—it'll take time to spin up." She looked at all of them. "Any more questions, or can we go?"

"Or how about you go," Tait said, dripping sarcasm, "and we stay here since you're obviously the leader."

Dia's jaw dropped. _Is that was this is all about? Your ego!?_

She briefly recalled his attempt to take charge when they first began the delve. She'd shut that down quickly, dismissing it as some kind of hormone-driven posturing for Kalina. The team had backed her, of course, and the incident was soon forgotten.

_Kalina's right. He's a child. An arrogant, petulant, child with a broken ego. But still, a child and..._ She sighed. _and I've been playing at his level._

She resolved to be a better person.

"You know what? Sure, that's a great idea." The words She somehow managed to keep the words free of any patronizing tone. Mostly.

"Uh really?" Tait was so taken aback by her shift in attitude he forgot to be angry.

"Mm-hmm." Dia nodded happily, then lay on her belly and swung her legs out into the empty expanse, feeling for a foothold.

"Don't you want the rope?" Tait held out the limp bundle.

"No, thank you," she said with saccharine cheer, "I'm good."

She disappeared over the edge, took four steps down, and paused. A slow breath left her lips as the pressure within her chest evaporated. She took an extra moment to luxuriate in the feeling of _space_. The wondrous feeling filled her soul, allowing it to breathe for the first time in what felt like an eternity.

It was almost a perfect moment. Almost, except for the angry whispers emanating from above.

Kali's head peaked out. She took one look at the relief on Dia's face and smiled. The whispers escalated into indignant voices. Kali rolled her eyes and mouthed, "I'll handle it."

Not for the first time did Dia wonder what she would do without her friend.

The ladder of carved steps descended straight down from the access panel to the fan. Each step curved inward, providing a secure grip, and before long Dia found herself standing on a narrow ledge, staring at the fan design.

Round edges straightened into angled overlapping planes, hiding the depths below and belying the ease with which a person could slip through and fall. Her eyes traced the edges as they flared out from the center toward the room's circumference, then dovetailed into a small slit inscribed along the perimeter under the ledge.

_Blades of structural Elderin with reactive core tips embedded in the slit._

The design was the essence of simplicity. Once the graetech was fed, those reactive cores would levitate between the tracks and rotate, spinning the blades into a blur of motion.

The design was absurdly excessive.

Setting aside the sheer cost of using structural elderin for something so mundane as a fan, every single one of the blade tips contained an elderin core. It made no sense. Three cores, equally distributed, would be more than sufficient to do the job. Instead, there were thirty.

Thirty.

She itched to get at those cores, whose value alone would make the whole delve more than worth it. Thirty high-quality cores would see all of them set for life. Or, well, it would see the others set for life. Dia's mother had more ambitious aspirations for her little princess.

Still, she briefly entertained images of chipping away the stone and running away from her controlling mother to start a business building tech... but that was followed by images of her and the fan falling a long way to her death. Also, she had no chisel, and she needed an inscriber more than she needed money.

No, she needed to _delve_ deep, find a floor no one had plundered. She needed to know what was below the fan.

A foot extended, tentative, then retracted. Bad idea. Instead, she knelt and tried to push the blades, but they might as well have been part of the walls for all she could move them. She knew this, of course, but knowing a fact wasn't the same when her life was on the line.

First attempt: Perched on knees, hands extended, one on each fan blade, she inserted her head between them, only to see the pitch black of an unlit shaft. She carefully tried to lift her lamp hand but that put her off balance.

_Dammit._

Second attempt: Lie down on the ridge, then slide herself between the blades, one hand extended with the lamp, the other preventing her from sliding through. She lit the shaft below, but she couldn't quite get her head far enough through to see it without abandoning her perch.

Third attempt: Forget the ledge. Lay across the blades and hook the feet to prevent sliding into a death-by-fall. Press her way down, slowly, between the pressing blades, and just as her knees pass the edge she began to slide. She scrambled back. Yes, her feet would have caught her but then she'd be hanging from a fan by her toes.

_I'm a coward. Yep. That's it. I'm a coward—no wait._

Forth attempt: Turn sideways and wedge the body between the blades. Stupid? Yes, but she felt secure. That was important. Little by little, both feet hooked just in case, she edged her head beyond the blades, shoulders pressed into them until they ached.

_Don't fall. Don't fall. Don't fall._

She pressed the light into the dark. Four floors down another access panel revealed itself on the opposite side of the shaft. She stared at it, hope warring with practical cynicism. Eight floors down, at least 2 floors beyond the deepest delve Dia had ever heard of.

She stared at it with longing.

"Okay," she yelled after shimmying herself back up through the blades, "now I need a rope."

"Coming," Kali's voice sang, echoing lightly through the shaft.

Dia watched as she quickly climbed down from the darkness, blood hemp coiled around her shoulder.

"Just you?" she said as Kalina landed on the ledge.

"Hmm?" Her eyes focused on Dia. "Oh, yeah. I think Tait's trying to organize a rebellion."

She began looking around the ventilation shaft, as though a coup were the most natural thing in the world.

"_What_ is his deal—no," Dia took a deep breath and huffed it out, "I know, manchild or whatever. But there's more to it Kali. He's carrying a delver's pack, a brand new one at that, and you can't convince me he's delved before."

Annoyance flashed across Kalina's face, replaced almost immediately with a patient smile.

"He got us this far."

"Uh-huh, and you buy the Shet-gang drivel he's feeding us?"

Kali's smile grew strained. "...no."

"And the pack?"

"Listen, Dia, I don't know, okay? But we're four floors down, and that's far deeper than we've ever been. This is our chance, Dia. Our shot. I know Tait's not on the level, but he's also the one giving us this chance. Can we not antagonize our only hope of making it big down here?"

Dia stared at her while a deep vexation warred with years of friendship. Predictably, friendship won.

"Fine," Dia growled. It was not fine, but because Kali was her best friend she would drop it... for now.

Kali rolled her eyes. "Where're we going?"

"Over here." Dia walked around the ledge to the opposite side of the ladder.

"Here? You sure," Kali asked when they stopped.

"Yeah, why?"

"How far down?"

"Another four floors."

"_Four_!?" The island girl's brow tried to climb into her hairline. "Do you know anyone who's delved eight floors deep?"

"No..." she said slowly, "for a very good reason."

And it wasn't because the traps became increasingly pernicious and elaborate the deeper you went, requiring ever more advanced tech to bypass. No, if that were all, the patient and the prepared would have won the day something like a thousand years ago.

Nobody had gotten further than maybe the sixth level for another reason entirely: bots. The ancients hadn't seen fit to simply use traps to guard their most precious tech. They'd created skeletal automatons to roam the halls in search of a soul to murder.

Indestructible and deadly, at best they could be temporarily disabled, only to rise scant minutes later to finish the job. Many a team had died, pursued by a bot straight into the traps they'd spent hours bypassing.

"Yeah, but we'll be coming in from the backside, right? The bots are guarding entry, but we'll already be _in_."

"I don't think they work like—"

"This could be it, Dia. This could be our score. You could find your inscriber and I... I could—give me that!" She gestured at Dia's light. "I want to see."

Dia let go of her lamp as Kali snatched it.

"Or we could die," she said too softly for her friend to hear, cause delving was a fool's game.

But sometimes, very rarely, someone drug up tech so advanced it reshaped society. It was a lure many found irresistible. She just never thought her friend would be one of them.

Dia watched Kali dump the rope on the ledge and work through a rather familiar series of attempts to look beneath the fan blades.

This was not the meticulous person she'd known since childhood, always organized, careful, prepared. What Dia had written off as nerves had become something else... something desperate.

She watched her friend with concern until the clues collapsed into certainty.

"Kali?"

"Hmm?" Laid out on the fan blades, she began to shimmy her way between them.

"What happened?"

Kali's body froze half wedged between the fans. A moment later she continued her press, though it was slower, more uncertain.

"What do you mean?" Her muffled voice came out strained.

"What happened, Kali?"

"Hold on," she growled.

Dia offered a hand to pull her back up to the edge after she pushed herself out from between the blades. She kept her eyes locked on Kali, who averted her gaze.

"Think about it, Dia. You could find your Inscriber."

"_What happened?_"

"_Nothing,_" she snarled. "Leave it alone."

Dia caught her friend's elbow as she tried to turn away. Kali jerked her elbow back. Her shoulders slumped, face pinched to hold back a flood, eyes fixed on the floor.

"Kali?"

"He left," she whispered, suddenly looking very small.

"Who left?" But horror crawled into her stomach. There was only one he in Kali's life that mattered.

Kali said nothing as conflict raged beneath a fragile mask, a mask Dia realized had been slowly wearing down for months. What she'd mistaken as the stress of delving was revealed as a lie. Kali had never feared the ancient halls. She feared something else entirely.

"Dad... _left,_" she said as though she couldn't comprehend her own words.

"What? No. Kali, he loves you more than anything. He would never just leave. When? Cause maybe he's—"

"_Months._"

"...w-what?" _We've been delving for months..._

Kali swallowed hard. Her words came out halting, as though each phrase tore a piece from her soul.

"He lost... his job... and... he... he looked, Dia. Dia, gods, he looked but he... he couldn't and... and he just left."

"No. _No,_ that doesn't make any sense. Why would he—"

"He's pushing, okay? He's pu—gods damned—he sends money every week." Tears streamed down her face. "Every. Single. Week."

"Oh gods, Kalina." She moved to envelop her friend.

"_No!_" Kali shoved her back, shaking her head fiercely.

"No," she repeated, and the mask slid back over her face. "We do this, Dia. You get your inscriber, okay? Right," she nodded to herself, "and I get... I get..."

She jerked away, knelt, and grabbed the roped, her movements stiff. When she stood again, the mask had settled a small smile on her face that could almost be genuine. Almost, except for her eyes. Dia couldn't understand how she'd missed it.

"So." Kali's brow raised. "How do we do this?"
