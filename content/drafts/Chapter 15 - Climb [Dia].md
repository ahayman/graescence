# 15 | Climb [Dia]

The tunnel angled maybe a dozen paces further. When she reached it, she took a moment to make sure everyone was behind her.

She continued on.

It took her several minutes to recognize something was wrong. At first, she'd thought it was just her mind playing tricks on her. Then she thought maybe it was an aftermath of so much adrenaline. Finally, she had to admit she did actually hear something.

She stopped and tilted her head. "Do you hear that?"

"Buzzing?" Kalina said.

"Yeah."

"Oh good," Malek said, "I thought I was loosing it."

"Can't loose what you never had." Kalina flashed him a smug smile.

He blinked at her and slowly shook his head. Kalina's smile faltered. He looked past her to Dia.

"What is it?" He sounded tired.

Dia opened her mouth but Moore beat her to it.

"Does it matter? We either go on or we don't."

Dia squeezed her eyes for a moment, then nodded. "Point."

She resumed crawling down the tunnel. The buzzing grew louder as they crawled. Then it took on undertones that seemed to resonate from within the mountain itself. Eventually, Dia realized she could feel the vibrations coming from the stone itself. The sound became deafening as they they approached the air shaft, to the point where Dia worried it would damage her hearing.

Someone poked her butt. She turned around to give Kalina a nasty glare. Kalina tried to yell over the sound but Dia couldn't make out a word. After a few attempts, Kalina rolled her eyes and resorted to simply pointing. Dia followed the gesture to where a hole was torn out of the tunnel floor.

"Oh."

Dia slowly shrugged off her— _Tait's_ —pack, placed her back against the wall, and drew her knees up to her chest. She closed her eyes and began lightly banging the back of her head against the wall.

Kalina mirrored Dia's position, though she wasn't quite as self destructive in her despair. She simply buried her head into her knees and cried.

Malek lay down without removing his pack and placed his head sideways in his arms. He stared at the wall blankly.

Moore tried to say something but not only could none of them make out his words, they weren't even trying. He shrugged after a couple attempts and settled himself in.

It took over an hour for the noise to stop, at least as best as Dia could figure it. She'd long since stopped banging her head on the wall, and even the little she had done was giving her cause to regret. Her head ached, although the noise could have done it just as well.

Kalina raised her head from her knees. She'd long since stopped crying, but her face was a mess of streaked tears and dirt, and her hair was an equally grungy, frizzled mess. It made Dia smile. They probably looked more like sisters in that moment than any other.

Dia opened her mouth to speak when a new noise entered her consciousness. Kalina met her eyes, then they both slowly turned to look back at the boys.

Malek was still in the same position, head resting on his forearms, eyes closed, mouth open, and with a pool of drool ever so slowly growing beneath it. Moore's head lulled to the side at such an angle that might tempt one to think he'd deceased except for the shuddering of his chest and that soft sound of snoring that filled the silence.

"How..." Kalina began but trailed off.

Dia nodded. "Unbelievable."

_I am so jealous..._

She might be exhausted enough to try it except she couldn't feed her light while sleeping and the prospect of waking up in an enclosed space in the pitch black dark filled her with the kind of terror that she feared would crack her mind wide open.

No, she'd spent the entire hour staring into her little light, feeding it her graescence and basking in its glory.

_I will never be without light again..._

A lie, a promise she knew she couldn't keep, yet it made her feel better all the same.

"Should we...?"

Dia looked at Kalina, then the boys. She shrugged.

"We should go soon..." Dia said, "if we can."

"I'll wake them," Kalina said reluctantly, "I suppose."

Dia nodded, then began to make her the edge of the tunnel, dreading what she would fine... or wouldn't find.

She first stuck her hand out into the darkness. Then she fed more graescence into it, brightening it. Then... she pulled her arm back in.

_Forsaken gods girl, get yourself together. It's either there or it's not. All you gotta do it check._

And yet not knowing was it's own kind of hope. If the rope wasn't there... if, somehow, that rope detached from the fan— and Dia _knew_ it shouldn't, she _knew_ it —yet if it wasn't there...

_Then we'll either die in the tunnel or die to that gods forsaken bot..._

And she couldn't decide which one was worse. Not knowing was it's own kind of hope. And Dia thought she might just jump out into the shaft instead of facing that bot again.

But no. She was no coward...

_Nope. I'm definitely a coward. And that's why I'm not going to jump into the— Gods what is wrong with you!? Just check the goddamned rope!_

She stuck her head out, then her hand, then she brightened the light, and then...

Dia slowly retracted herself into the tunnel. She leaned against the wall and let out a long breath. A single laugh escaped her lips. Then another; then another. More followed until she found herself laughing so hard she couldn't stop. It was great; it was fantastic; it was utterly absurd.

She lulled her head to the side, allowing her view to take in the wide-eyed and horror-filled expectations directed at her. Her laughter died down and she smiled at her team.

"We have rope," she said, allowing hope to spark for just a moment, "on the _other_ side of the shaft."

She stuck her arm out, leaned back, and forced more graescence into the light, revealing a tantalizing rope dangling in space. A rope that would lead to freedom if only they could fly.

"Can I call crush now?" Malek said, his voice tinged with insanity.

Kalina began laughing, which caused Dia to start up again. Malek tried to resist, but after only a few seconds he also succumbed to the gallows humor driving their mood.

"Yes! Yes!" Kalina said after a bit, her voice cracking, "Let's call it crush. You got it, Malek. Fucking crush."

"Fucking Tait..."

"NO!" Kalina snarled, turning on Malek in a blink. "You gods forsaken imbecile. So you think he planned this?"

"No! I just—"

"You think he fucking _wanted_ to be here? To die by some random bot!?"

"I'm just saying if—"

"There's no fucking 'if', Malek. Tait _died_ down here. You get that? He fucking died, and he did it saving your sorry ass."

Kalina stared something fierce at Malek, who managed to meet her glare for all of four seconds before turning away.

"We will never speak bad of Tait," Dia said, her voice firm. "He gave us a chance, and he died to save us and..." her voice hitched, "...and we treated him like— no," she shook her head, then again more fiercely, "No, we won't speak ill of him, not ever again."

Kalina nodded, her eyes wet. Moore looked Dia in the eyes and gave her a sad, but somewhat proud smile. He nodded.

Malek looked between the rest of his party and seemed to deflate. He nodded as well, but he was grinding his teeth. Kalina opened her mouth but Dia forestalled her with a hand on hers. She gave Kalina a curt shake of the head. Kalina stared at Dia for a moment, then shrugged off her hand. She didn't say anything else.

"What's in the bag," Moore said, changing the subject.

Dia stared at him for a moment before realizing what he meant.

"Oh gods! You're right..."

Dia immediately grabbed Tait's bag and began laying everything out.

_Rope Caster, gravity tunnel, shielded tunnel, four gravity caps, a... disruptor tunnel— gods, so many tunnels —a cold tunnel... wow, didn't know that was a thing. Ha! A heat tunnel, seriously!? Are there cold traps? Whatever... what else— oh gods, like four more rope anchors and... and..._

Dia slowly removed _five_ graetech lights from the packs. She set each one down with a loud clack.

Jaw clenched, she spoke through her teeth.

"We will _not_ speak ill. about. Tait. _Do you hear me?_"

Kalina bit her lower lip. Malek snorted loudly and looked like he really wanted to say something, but quickly decided his life was worth more than whatever asinine comment was bouncing around his little head. Moore just frowned, looking disappointed and more than a little confused.

Dia frowned, realizing his confusion was warranted, cause...

_why did he climb down the rope in the dark..._

Dia shook off the thought. It wasn't as though an answer would just announce itself and they had bigger problems to worry about, like surviving.

She handed out three of the lights, storing the other two back in the pack along with all the tunnels— _delving involves far too much crawling._ The front pouch still held the bot-disruptor but that was all it held, and so Dia didn't feel the need to bring it out. Besides, it was useless for now.

_It would take four full grown adults to fill just one of those resevoirs._

The anchors, though, she left out.

"Watcha thinkin?" Kalina asked as Dia stared them.

"Ever been mountain climbing?"

Kalina's eyes jumped between Dia and the anchors.

"Noooo... and, I don't think they were made for that..."

"Yeah, but it could work."

"Might."

"Should."

Kalina rolled her eyes and waved her head in a half wag, half shake.

"You can't even wrap all your fingers around it."

"But it's possible—"

"I'll do it," Moore said.

They both looked over at Moore, then down at his fingers.

"You could wrap like two of your fingers around that."

"I could still—"

"No," Dia interrupted, "you can't, not across the tunnel, not with two fingers."

"Fine," Kalina sighed, "I'll do it."

Dia stared at her. "I'm sorry, but are we working through the dumbest ideas first?"

"Hey!"

"There's no way your delicate little fingers are strong enough."

"They're not _that_ delicate!"

"Pfha!"

"Like you're so manly!"

"This whole idea is stupid," Malek said, staring at the two incredulously.

Both Kalina and Dia turned to him, slowly examining his body while he grew increasingly uncomfortable.

"What?"

"Huh," Dia said after a few moments.

"His fingers are a good size," Kalina agreed.

Dia nodded. "And men _do_ have more upper body strength. That's a proven fact."

"It's not _that_ far..."

"Oh no. Nope. No. No no no no no no. Do you hear me? Not a fucking chance. Nope. Nada. Ain't gonna happen."

Both Kalina and Dia levelled wicked smiles. Malek tried to back up, looking on the verge of running— or whatever the equivalent would be in the tunnel— but he'd backed himself right up against Moore who, to his horror, was giving him the same wicked smile as the girls.

---

"I hate you soooo much right now," Malek said, dangling from one of the anchor embedded in the air shaft wall.

To his credit, he was doing a good job. His could fit four of his fingers around an embedded anchor, and he'd made his way around about a quarter of the shaft, or half way to his destination.

"You're almost there!"

"Fuck you!" he cried out while swinging from one hand. He'd let go of the other, allowing himself to dangle by one arm in what Dia could only think was his version of rest.

After a few moments, he swung himself back around and grabbed the other embedded anchor. With a thought, he released the prior anchor, leaving behind a cloud of pulverized stone in his wake. He swung on the remaining anchor and slammed the prior anchor into a new hole.

It was impressive, really, the timing of it. Their tunnel was now riddled with dozens of holes, all created as Malek learned just how much graescence he needed to trigger the anchor to... well, anchor. These were not like climbing picks, designed to grab and release. Anchors were designed to grab and hold, releasing only when their reserve had run out or the release was triggered, which required graescence equal to the reservoir holding it in place. The end result was that anchors like this wasted a huge amount a graescence to use as climbing picks in the way Malek was.

And he was quickly showing that strain. By the time he reached the rope, he wasn't just sweating, he was lagging. He looked exhausted and ready to quit.

The team heckled him relentlessly. Both joking about and challenging his intelligence, his manhood, his mother or lack thereof— _anything_ to keep him going. Yet despite the jokes and levity, Dia almost panicked at every apparent slip.

_I can't loose anyone else..._

"Come on! My grandma could do this in her sleep!" Dia shouted as he reached for the rope.

"Fuck off Dia! Your grandma is... agh, almost... got it... yeah!" Malek shouted as he latched on to the rope...

...then lost his grip on the anchor.

The team shouted as one, including Malek, who swayed out over the pit before his momentum brought him back to the wall.

Dia closed her eyes as Malek grabbed the anchor. Her breath came out as a sigh. She wasn't sure she could take any more deaths.

Malek wound the rope about sixteen times around his wrist, or at least far more than he needed. Dia was only surprised that he hadn't wrapped it around the rest of this body. She certainly would have.

The climb back was much less dramatic. Having wrapped the rope around his arm, Malek began using the existing holes to pull himself back without needing to create new anchors or holes.

The downside? He left two very, very expensive pieces of graetech still embedded near where the rope had been.

When he practically collapsed in the tunnel, Kalina leaned over him.

"Do you have any idea how much those things can cost?"

"Nope, and don't care," He casually leaned out into the air shaft, "but if you wanna go get them? Please, be my guest."

Kalina followed his gaze, then looked back at him. "Fine, whatever. We'll just—"

"Pay it out of the obscene amount of loot we've stuffed into our packs?"

"Uh... yeah. That."

Dia retrieved yet another anchor from Tait's pack and drove it into the tunnel floor, then attached the rope to it.

"It'll last at least—"

"Long enough for us to climb. Yeah Dia, we know. And yet it's another absurdly expensive piece of tech we'll be left to pay for," Kalina said.

Dia gave Kalina a flat look. "Would you like to get out alive?"

"I would like to get out with at least some money..."

"I'd settle for life," Moore said.

"You'd settle for—" Kalina began.

"Life," Dia said, grabbing her hand and squeezing hard, "He'd settle for life. Let's just... go, okay?"

Kalina pressed her lips together, snorted or grunted out something incomprehensible, but didn't press the issue.

Dia was first. Dia was always first. It didn't matter whether she wanted to be first. She just was, somehow. This time, she was first because Malek had crawled over both her and Kalina after retrieving the rope. He passed the rope to Dia, as though somehow this whole episode was her responsibility, her fault, then he'd barrelled through to sit back with Moore.

He'd left Dia holding the rope, the first to ascend back up into the darkness. She'd been the one to drive a new anchor into the tunnel floor. She'd be the one to climb the rope first.

Why? She had no idea. She was just first. It was her curse.

Here's a fun fact: you didn't have to feed graetech with your hands. Yes, just about everyone used their hands, but that wasn't a biological necessity. It's just that reaching out with your hand was a simple and inevitable thing to do, and it was the first place anyone learns to feed graescence from. Yet a person could feed their graescence from anywhere. Their hands, yes, but also their feet, for instance. Or their forearms— several types of shields required that. The waist was also popular for specialized belts, assuming you had a belt costing more than a small house. In fact, most specialized graetech was absurdly expensive and often required feeding it from weird places.

So no, the vast majority of people in the world only ever used their hands to feed graetech, and that likely for tech they never owned. It was a vanishingly rare breed that ever found the need to feed graetech with their _lips_.

It tingled.

Which was weird. She tried to ignore it, but it _tingled_. Did graescence not infuse the lips as much? She was pretty sure it infused every living thing, even every _part_ of every living thing. Many believed that graescence wasn't just endemic to life, but necessary for it, integral to it. They believed that any living thing without graescence wasn't actually living, or if they were, they were somehow lessor.

It was an absurd kind of superiority complex whereby someone took an extreme minority and belittled them in order to make oneself feel better. As though their life wasn't already difficult enough.

It was also possible that Dia's mind was wandering around useless topics to distract her from the burning of her back and her shoulders and her arms.

She was only half way there, but at least her mouth was filled with light. The others had quite prudently stored their light, devoting all their energy to the climb. Dia just couldn't do it. The idea of climbing a rope in the pitch black was a special level of hell.

It wasn't lost on her that her phobia was the only reason her friends could climb unobstructed.

But no, she held her light in her lips, feeding it precious energy she needed to climb her way up. She was a beacon, a light the others could follow if only because she was first... and she was afraid. Terrified. She held her light in her lips because the alternative was terror.

So she continued on, feeding the light while the muscles in her body burned. By the time she scrambled through the fan blades she was done. Her body trembled, her light dim.

_But I made it._

She turned over, gasping while the fan's edges dug into her back. Turns out, climbing up a rope was hells of a lot more difficult than rappelling down one.

"_MOVE_ dammit!"

Dia moaned and flopped over a few times to make way for Kalina, which hurt with the blade edges digging in but she couldn't bring herself to care. Kalina splayed out in virtually the same way Dia had until Malek cursed at her. The sequence was followed by Moore, who did not splay out in exhaustion— the bastard —even though he was carrying both his own pack and the heaviest pack of all. Her pack.

Her _Inscriber_. She eyed it covetously.

"You know we need to move on," Malek said into the air, his face unerringly aimed toward the black abyss above.

"You know we're fuckin' tired, right?" Kalina said, also staring up.

"Lazy ass shits," Dia added. Unhelpful, yes, but she found it amusing.

"Language," Kalina snorted.

"Ha! Coming from you..."

"Did we bring food?" Malek asked, again without looking at anyone.

Dia began to chuckle. "No! That would have been waaay too smart for us."

"Figures."

"I know, right? Who brings food on a delve? Or water— gods forsaken but I'm thirsty."

"I have to pee."

Everyone turned to stare a Kalina.

"What!? I do..."

Malek blinked twice. "Okay, go ahead."

"You fuckin' perve! Turn around."

Malek very slowly lolled his head in another direction.

"You better not peep," Kalina grumbled as she pushed herself to her feet. She groaned. "Ugh..."

For a moment Dia was curious as to how she would manage it. While there was plenty of space between the slats of the fan, there was no direct empty space below them as the slats overlapped. Also, how far down would that go?

As Kalina pulled her pants down, Dia suddenly realized she wasn't quite _that_ curious. She turned her head.

The sound of water splatting on wood filled the space for a few seconds.

"Ewww..." Dia couldn't help herself.

"That's it!?" Malek said after it was clear Kalina was done.

"Yeah, whatch'ya expect? A waterfall?"

"No, but I thought you just _had_ to pee."

"I did," Kalina said, indignant as she pulled up her pants.

"Clearly not."

"What is your problem?"

Honestly, Dia was wondering the same. Why were they so confused?

"It takes a lot longer to pee than that," Malek said while pushing himself up, then balancing his buttocks on one of the fan blades.

"What? No." This from both Dia and Kalina.

"Yeah, it really does," Moore said.

And suddenly Dia realized he was sitting the in the exact same position as before with his back against the wall. Maybe he'd closed his eyes? She felt she should give him the benefit of the doubt.

Also, "No it doesn't."

Malek's eye jumped between the two girls. "Uh yeah, unless you've broken the seal or something."

Kalina rolled her eyes. "I have not been drinking— where would I even have the chance?" Then she grumbled under her breath, "not that I couldn't use one, or six."

"Just saying, it takes a lot... longer..." his brow drew down slowly, as though realizing something.

Malek turned to Moore, who just shrugged. "Huh, weird."

"What in the hells," Malek exclaimed. "Why do they get such a short pee... uh, time?"

"Is _this_ what we're discussing now?" Dia exclaimed.

Kalina pressed her head into her hand. "This is officially the dumbest conversation I've ever had."

"Wait, it literally takes you that long to pee!?" Malek said, apparently unable to let it go.

"Yes. Yes it does. Do you feel inadequate yet?

"What, no? Why would I—"

"Cause all I'm saying is size matters... it really does."

Dia slowly turned her head to Kalina, who was maintaining a superior expression on her face.

"Size?" Dia said slowly, "and how would you know _that_?"

"What, no! I'm not..." Kalina turned bright red, "I'm just saying he's clearly... uh, constrained!"

All three of them stared at her until she quite literally stomped her foot.

"No! That's not... listen. I was just saying— Forsaken gods, can we just go!?"

Kalina walked over and reached toward the rope.

Dia immediately slapped her hand away. "Nya uh. Mine."

Kalina rolled her eyes but back off. It was at that point that Dia realized the cinch securing the rope was long overdue. She grabbed the rope and slowly pulled at it until the cinch had rotated around the blade. At seeing it, she _knew_ it had only a couple minutes left before it released the rope into the abyss.

"Wow."

Everyone turned to her.

"Wow what?" Kalina demanded.

"Uh... nothing?" Dia though furiously for a moment before finding the perfect redirection. "Just, clearly women are vastly superior to men."

Malek's face flattened. "Because you can pee quicker?"

Kalina smiled, smug. "Yep."

"Oh gods," Malek said, "we really do need to 'just go'." He mocked Kalina with the last of his words.

Dia fed a ridiculously small release on the side of the cinch, which just happened to be right next to a much larger lead that would cinch the rope tighter. It took her several tries to release the rope, all the while cursing whoever designed the thing.

_Oh, I'm testy. Need to keep a lid on that..._

She pulled the rope up, looping it until she realized it didn't matter. Cause there was a caster that would do the work for her.

_And I'm tired... right. Just need to..._

She pulled out the caster, stared at it, then fed the rope through the back loop and into the chamber. She fed the lead and watched as the rope shot out...

...about sixteen paces.

"Uh..." Malek said in what encompassed the entirety of his eloquence.

"No wait! I got this," Dia said as she retracted the rope back through the caster.

"Okaaaay..."

"Hold on, just give me a sec."

This time she fed it everything she had, pushing until there was nothing left in her and her light had almost completely gone out.

She watched as it disappeared into the darkness.... way above her target. She stared at it as it collapsed down on itself, randomly bunching onto the fan blades.

"Is that even the right tunnel?"

Dia did a double take, then counted.

_One, two... shit..._

Her target was far beyond the edge of their light. She might even had hit it had she been pointing the gun in the right direction.

Kalina stomped over and snatched the caster from Dia's hands. Dia didn't bother resisting.

She shook her head, "I'm more tired than I thought."

Kalina snorted, "Clearly. But perhaps you can help, light girl."

Dia turned to her. "Light girl? Was that supposed to be an insult."

Kalina scowled at her. "Just light it up. I need to see... err, ah behind me please."

Dia picked her way behind Kalina, took a deep breath, and yet again shoved her essence into the contraption, lighting it up to a blinding brilliance.

Malek groaned from the floor, "Ugh... it burns..."

_How is that even comfortable?_ Dia wondered as Kalina took aim. Malek was still splayed out over four of the blades. They must be digging into his back.

A swoosh followed by the zing of a rope drew Dia's attention back to Kalina. She watched as the rope went out unerringly toward their tunnel... and missed. It wasn't by much, but it was still a miss.

Dia groaned. "I can't keep this up." Her head was light and sparks floated in her eyes.

"Just one more try," Kalina said, gathering rope even as it fell back down. "...uh, Dia?"

Dia stared at Kalina for a second, then realized her light was barely reaching the second tunnel.

"Must I?"

Kalina turned to look a Dia. She spoke slowly. "Yeah. Yeah you must."

"...fine."

Dia shoved her essence into the stupid, gods forsaken black hole of a contraption, brightening it until it just barely reached the fourth tunnel.

The light wavered, drawing in and out in such a way that probably make it hard to aim.

"Dia?"

"Now or never Kali. I can't keep this up."

"Don't call me— Agh! Alright okay, just..."

Kalina squinted her eyes. For a moment Dia thought she could feel the graescence being dumped into the caster's reservoir. The swoosh came and that was followed by the zing of the rope, which she realize was cause by it rubbing against the feeder ring.

Then came the snap.

Dia stared as the rope as it refused to fall.

_Uhh..._

"Yeah, I know, right— ah!" Kalina turned quickly, a wide grin on her face. Her spin twisted out from under her as her heel slipped off the fan blade.

Dia saw her grin shift to an expression of shock before her best friend slid down between the fan blades.

Dia lunged for her. In retrospect, it was a stupid thing to do. She almost followed her friend into the black abyss below. The only thing that saved her was her feet, which she hooked around the fan blade to arrest her fall.

It was only after she'd exhausted her scream that she realized there were a pair of feet dangling next to her head. About that time, someone grabbed hold of her feet and began pulling her back up through the fan blades.

"You trying to die?" Moore said after he'd pulled Dia up enough for her to regain place on the fan.

Dia looked over at Kalina in a daze. Malek had tried to pull Kalina up, but that mostly ended up with Kalina crawling up his arm instead. Both their faces betrayed panic and relief in equal measure.

"Can we go now?" Malek whined.

Dia stared at the rope. "I'm not sure I can make it up that..."

"Gotta," Moore said from beside her. "Not much choice."

Dia nodded. It was true, but gods was she tired. She didn't get up.

Malek groaned first. "Fine..." He got up, slowly. His pack had been positioned on his stomach, so it swung it around and secured to his back.

Dia took that as her cue to get up, so she did. She picked her way to the rope and stared at it. She was bracketed by Kalina and Malek. Neither of them made a move for the rope.

"Four floors," Malek said, "...just four."

"Yeah," Dia nodded slowly, feeling the exhaustion buffet her body. "...just four."

"If we don't start—" Moore began.

"Yeah! I know!" Dia snapped, then snatched at the rope. She turned and glared at Moore before she began her laborious ascent.

It was laborious. Exhausting. She slipped three times and almost took out Kalina twice. Stupidly, the others followed her without waiting for her to reach the top. This made the rope taut, which didn't allow her to wrap it around her hands. And she would have. She would have wrapped her hand with the rope and dangled there and... probably taken a nap.

She never got the chance. Instead, she climbed. Four floors. Not so far. With enough light, she could have looked up and seen her goal. Had she stairs, it would have taken her only a few minutes.

The climb felt like an eternity, and when she reached the tunnel, her arms were shaking so bad she almost fell right back out of the tunnel.

She didn't, though, and the others followed, each puffing out their exhaustion as they clawed their way into the tunnel. Moore especially looked spent, barely managing the final climb into the tunnel with two packs on him.

Dia stared at the inscriber strapped to his back. It was heavy, really heavy, and she was mildly surprised he'd managed to climb a total of eight floors with it. She _should_ feel guilty, yet all she truly felt was relief. Deep down she needed that device in a way should could never fully quantify.

_I'll make it up to him... somehow..._

They crawled through the access tunnel at slower pace than if she'd been meticulously checking for traps. She wasn't, though. There were no traps. It was still stupid— you _always_ check for traps, even if you know they're not there. To do anything else was a quick way to die.

She still didn't. They all stumbled out into the original, dust-ridden room where they'd first discovered the hidden panel. Then the stumbled into the hallway.

"Moore," Dia said as he spilled into the room.

He raise a single brow.

She thrust her hand at _her_ pack, the one with the most important artifact in the world, the one on his back.

He gave her a skeptical look, before reluctantly removing her pack from his back and repositioning his own in its place. She shouldered her pack and shuddered under the weight.

The next two hours was probably the most dangerous part of their delve so far. Three times one of them almost died to a trap they knew was there. The first time Kalina saved Dia from simply walking through a gravity crush she knew was there but couldn't be bothered to even think about.

The second time Malek wasn't following Dia's instructions and placed the gravity cap in the wrong place. The third time Moore simply didn't duck down far enough. A ceiling crush partially lifted him off the ground before he realized his mistake and compensated.

They were just exhausted, and with that exhaustion came mistakes. Yet it was only upon reflection did Dia realize just how close they'd come to killing themselves.

Dia refused to consider how many of those mistakes were hers.

The door to the warren was just a door. Like below, it had a panel on the outside that required a code, very much like the one's she'd defeated below. Though this one used only a three by three grid. The code was a closely guarded secret that virtually everyone in the lower city knew.

That was the outside, though. The inside had a simple lead that unlatched the door with barely a trickle of graescence. Dia fed it and pushed the door open.

Light blinded her while the warm humid stench invaded her mouth and nose. It as familiar as it was unwelcome, especially after spending all day in the cool dry air of well ventilated columns.

A haze hung in the air, smelling of overcooked food, human waste, and decomposing trash. It dirtied the light from lamps hazardously hung and distantly space on the cavern ceiling. They cast sharp, conflicting shadows that contrasting areas of glaring bright and shaded darkness.

It still stung her eyes after enduring barely-lit darkness for most of the day. She had to blink the tears from her eyes several times before they adjusted. When her vision cleared enough to see, what greeted her made her wish she were back in delve.

Thugs.

At least a dozen of mismatched ruffians has surrounded the exit. They mostly wore the loose styles of clothing favored by most Caldonians, though they were mismatched and she spotted a couple of the rigid jackets favored by the Rotakans. The conflicting styles were jarring and wholly unnecessary. Even Moore, who was dirt poor and had no sense of style, could match his clothes better than these people. Three of them were... uh, female ruffians, though they had an edge to their look that set Dia at unease.

Most looked bored, leaning against whatever vertical surface was nearby. A few were sitting. One might think they just happened to be hanging around, doing whatever things mismatched gangs do, but as Dia appeared several of them pushed off their languid reposes and became alert... or well, more alert. They still looked bored.

Dia did spot several knives and even, oddly, a baton or two, but they were all in the sheathes, latched, or otherwise secured. None of the thugs looked particular threatened by the appearance of four adolescent teenagers. One of the ones with a jacket reached out and smacked a thin, lanky kid upside the back of his head. The kid looked startled for a moment, then angry, then seemed to come to a realization. He took off running.

"Uh..." Malek said, once again producing a level of oratory excellence that staggered Dia. Truly incredible. His inspiring monologue complete, he sat down.

Dia shrugged off both packs and sat down, groaning from exhaustion.

"Is this gonna take a while?" she asked the thug in the coat. "Cause I could use a nap."

The thug looked surprised, then chuckled. "She's around. Cafe maybe?"

"Cafe? Down here? Not likely." Kalina said as she propped her pack up on one Dia's. She sat down, leaning against it. A soft sigh left her lips.

The thug seemed to consider that for moment, then shrugged.

Moore emerged last, blinking a few times at the light. Several of the thugs did tense when they saw him, but most seemed to realize he was still young under all that bulk. Moore ignored them, dropping his pack and arranging it to use as a pillow. He lay down and closed his eyes, looking as though he was going to nap right there in the middle of the street.

After his mouth dropped open, Dia realized it wasn't for show. She couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy as a soft snore sounded from his mouth barely a minute later.

A commotion followed a few minutes later as an entourage of even more thugs made it's way down the street. Dia sat up, frowning. There were like twenty thugs now, and all for four teenagers? Overkill was putting it mildly. Or maybe the lady who led them always walked around with her... thugs.

_Ugh... need a different word... minions? No... that's just horrible. Guards? Too legit. Underling? Hmmm... lackey? Naw. Henchman! Yeah, henchmen._

The woman, whom Dia presumed was Blackwater, was not what she expected. She'd pictured a tall, lithe woman with wiry muscles, short hair— or maybe just in a bun —and a mean countenance. Maybe a snarl. The kind of person that would shank you in an alley for a few creds.

_Oh and a scar down the left side of her face. Right beneath her eye down to her jaw. Missing the lips, though. Can't be disfigured, just... intimidating, like she allowed her mortal enemy one scar to accentuate her severe beauty before gutting him._

This woman looked more like the accountant that was kicked around for giving her boss the wrong answer. She was small, mousy, with thin lips and a hooked nose. She had a slight hunch that might have screamed grandma if she were older.

_Maybe she is the accountant..._

But she doubted it. What made Dia sit up wasn't the absurd number of henchmen or even the lady herself, but the _graetech_. The woman was carrying a fortune on her person.

_One wrist shield generator with a small buffer and a regulator. Three seconds to form a shield. Two graetech knives, one on her hip, another on her ankle. Two casters, one sling, the other an actual rail caster... a freaking rail caster. For all the forsaken gods, why? What was she going to do with it, impale a imperial warior from sixteen paces through two walls?_

None of it was visible, which was impressive on several levels. Blackwater was wearing loose cloths but nothing out of sync with current fashions. At least she was decently matched in layers of complimenting gray. Yet even knowing every piece of graetech on her, Dia still struggled to see any of it.

As the group approached, Dia revised her estimation of the women. She was still mousy, but the woman's eyes held a sharp intelligence that put Dia ill at ease.

Blackwater's minions stopped with the rest while Blackwater herself took a few more steps in. She took her time looking over the group, seeming in no hurry as she assessed the each one of Dia's group, then took in the packs. Her eyes lingered on the pack Dia was leaning against, widening slightly as she took in the Inscriber strapped to it.

Her eyes then fixed entirely on Tait's pack. Her eyes narrowed and her lips pressed together. When she spoke, it was in an slow, even, flat tone.

"Where's Tait?"
