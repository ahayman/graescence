# 16 | Hunter [Roland & Sal]

The log was half-rotten, covered with a damp green moss, and would probably collapse under any weight. Roland leapt up on it. His foot slid on the slick emerald, forcing him to shimmy awkwardly on one food, his other limbs splayed out for balance.

Just as he gained a semblance of poise, a crack radiated from under his heel. He shifted his weight just as the rot gave way and use his other foot to launch himself to a boulder beyond.

He turned around and flashed Sal a wide grin.

“Your turn,” he said as he stepped off the boulder, locked his knees, and enjoyed the jarring sensation as he landed.

Sal, who had stopped to watch, shook his head slowly. He then walked around the log.

“Okay, how about this?," Sal said as he caught up, "Two brothers, bound by blood, torn apart by their love of the same—“

"Naw."  Roland wrinkled his nose.

Sal pinched his brow. “Why not?”

“Just no.”

Sal narrowed his eyes, but Roland kept his eyes forward on the path. They fell silent and walked a few minutes before a smile tugged at Sal’s lips.

“How about two _sword masters_, brothers-in-arms, torn apart by their love—“

“Seriously?”

“What? It’s a good story, and you like swords.”

A sword... that's what he was missing. Roland spotted a good stick, stepped off the forest path, and picked up the branch to look at it. It was knobby with a few twigs but straight... ish? It was straight enough.

“Who fights over a girl?” he said as he angled the stick back and forth.

“Laurice is cute.”

“Who?” Roland swung his new 'sword' back and forth a few times. He broke off a couple minor twigs and began twisting off a larger one.

“You know, Laurice… she’s cute.”

Roland stopped his examination of the sword-stick and stared at Sal, face skeptical.

“The inn-keeper’s daughter?”

“Yeah.”

“But she's like fifteen.”

“So? She’s nice.”

“You're not even twelve.”

“In a couple weeks—“

“She's old, Sal. Besides, you know she wouldn't...” Oh, that was the wrong thing to say; Roland twisted his lips.

Sal kicked at the dirt. “No, I know...”

"I'm sorry—."

"I _know_... I just," Sal huffed, "...never mind."

Sal walked down the path, shoulders slumped. Roland watched him with a conflicted expression. He scowled, took another look at the stick, and smacked it hard against a nearby tree trunk. The whack it made was satisfying, loud and sturdy, a good weapon.

He jogged up to Sal, walked beside him, picked out a rock, leapt to it, wobbled, jumped to another rock, wobbled some more.

"Come on, Sal, cheer up," he said while shifting his weight, "there are other girls."

Sal grunted out a noise, but Roland's eyes were already glued ahead. The next rock was a little ways, but doable, maybe. Still balancing on his leg, he crouched, careful to keep other foot off the ground.

The rock slid out just as he vaulted off it and he made only half the intended distance, right into the mud.

"Hey!"

Sal, who had been carefully walking the edge, had stopped to wipe off the splatter.

"Ahhh, sorry?" Roland said with a sheepish grin.

Sal shot his friend a glare, but quickly returned his attention to his shirt while he climbed up the path, his breath heaving lightly from the effort. Roland looked down at his mud-splattered trousers and shrugged. Mud was a small price to pay for fun.

Err no, mud was _part_ of the fun.

Just beyond the next bend was a small glade. A sprawling Whitewood guarded the far side, it's white bark mottled with a honeyed morning light that streamed though branches cast wide and low in the space given it. Spots of grass had been worn down by play, with the discarded weapons of past adventures littered about. The sound of distant tinkling drifted on a lazy breeze, carried sporadically from a nearby stream.

Sal angled toward a nearby log, some tree long ago pushed over by a windstorm, then worn down over the years to make a suitable bench. He pushed himself up to sit on it.

“She's cute, and she's nice to me.”

Roland opened his mouth but could think of nothing to say. Laurice was nice to everyone, but that didn't mean she'd consider Sal as anything other than an outsider. This no matter that Sal had lived here almost his whole life. His brown skin and short stature marked him as other.

Roland pushed himself up on the log and sat next to Sal.

"She wouldn't be allowed," Roland said quietly.

Sal didn't respond; his leg bounced against the log. He turned to Roland. "How about a Pirate King?"

A bright smile split Roland's mouth. He slid off the log and thrust his stick out in a mock stab. "That's more like it.”

“So you’re the pirate king—“

“Of course I am.” Roland stabbed the air dramatically, then again.

“—and I’m the bounty hunter chasing you—“

“I dunno—" He stopped stabbing the air.

“—because you stole the heart of the Emperor’s daughter.”

"Or... I was secretly protecting the villages from the Emperor's goons—"

"—but she was really betrothed to me."

"Be what? Ugh okay— you know what? Fine, you can have her."

"Come on! That's now how it works."

"Why not? I don't want her."

"We have to have a reason to fight."

"I just told you! I'm protecting the—"

"Wouldn't the Pirate King be killing and plundering?"

"He doesn't _have_ to..."

Sal's face became exasperated. "It's literally in the name: Pirate. Pi. rate. Pirate... see? They steal; they plunder."

"No, Sal, there's nothing about the name—"

"You can't always be the hero."

Roland's face soured.

“Listen. We’ll do it after lunch.”

“I don't—”

“And… and you can make up whatever you want now.”

Roland shot his friend a malicious smile.

“Just so long as I get the girl in the end.” Sal threw out the words, then sucked in his lips.

“Ah, whatever, fine… weirdo.”

Sal flashed him a grin full of teeth.

“My turn then,” Roland said. “You’re the monster and I’m the hunter.”

Sal's face flattened. “We did that last time.”

“I know—“

“And the time before that—“

“I know, I know, but we’ll make it better.”

Sal raised an eyebrow. “Uh huh, how?”

“Hmmm…” Roland twisted his lips, “how about if you’re smarter and don’t get caught so easily.”

“Hey!”

“Okay, sorry. Just kidding... sort of. Uh, how about you’re a monster that can wield weapons?”

Sal’s eyes lit up. “A lance?”

“No, a sword.”

“Why not a lance?”

“Lances are stupid.”

Sal threw his hands up. “How are they stupid?”

“What are we going to do, throw rocks?”

Sal looked like he was going to argue, but then let out a huff as he slid off the log. “Fine, it’s your story, I guess.”

“And the monster *cannot* climb trees.”

Sal chuckled, “You’re no fun.”

"I'm serious!"

"I know, fine! No naps... geeze, it only happened once."

“Okay,” Roland said, “so the monster has been rampaging through— hey, where are you going?”

Sal, who had started to walk away, turned around. “You're just going to go on about the dastardly monster killing spree blah blah blah, and the great champion Roland blah blah blah. Can we just play?”

“Dastar—what?”

“It's a word.”

“You sure?”

“Have you ever considered reading a book?”

Roland gave him a skeptical look. “Sounds boring”

“Whatever,” Sal turned away, “lets just play.”

“Okay, but the story is— hey, come back!”

But Sal was already running. He shouted over his shoulder as he disappeared into the forest, “You're the hunter, so hunt!”

----

While morning rapidly fled the sun's onslaught, its dew still clung to the brush hidden beneath a forest canopy that allowed only the spears of dawn to penetrate. It was between these spears that Roland moved unseen, unheard, quiet, a predator stalking its prey.

He was close, very close. He could sense it in deadly instincts honed over years of endless hunts. This would be his crowning moment, the reward of months spent tracking what anyone else would flee.

The great champion Roland said, “blah blah blah,” then stopped and released a sigh through his nose. Sal was right. He really did overuse the whole champion thing.

The *great beast-hunter* Roland stalked through the forest.

He nodded to himself. Much better.

His steps were so light that that silence itself stood in awe. His movements were so fluid and graceful that— he froze at the snap of a twig? He cocked his head to listen. He definitely heard something. Close. Ahead and to his left.

His eyes narrowed as he peered through the brush with the sharpened vision he'd gained from endless hunts. He saw nothing — clearly, this beast was a master at hiding — but he was sure the great beast was there. Twigs don’t snap themselves.

He couldn't push through the brush without giving himself away but near the far edge stood a thick tree, a perfect place to hide for an ambush. He angled to move around the thicket, picked his way across the forest floor with unparalleled grace. He pressed his back against the trunk.

He could hear Sal— no, he shook his head in frustration; what he heard was the massive beast beyond. Likely, it was cowering in fear of the great beast hunter— no no, that’s not right either. Why would it cower? He needed a better back story.

That’s what Sal didn’t understand. The story was everything. Without a good one, they were just two kids playing in the woods. Boring. But if he could create the right story, they weren’t playing, they were on a grand adventure. So…

The beast had killed countless innocents and then carved a bloody path through an endless stream of hunters seeking fortune and fame.

So. much. better. Roland shook off the goosebumps.

The beast was supposed to be a massive boar-like thing that stood on two legs, with long bloody tusks— wait, why were the tusks bloody? Did it just walk around dripping blood? How would that even work?

No, it had wicked tusks stained with dried blood— ah, better —horrible red eyes, and long wicked claws that could render a man in two. It was even reported to wickedly wield the weapons of those it killed.

It was a wicked beast.

It was thought unstoppable, but the beast had never encountered the great beast hunter Roland, protector of the poor, champion of the weak, hero to all mankind.

Now *that* was a proper backstory.

Feeling prepared, Roland spun himself around the tree. A massive hairy slab of muscle stood there. He smiled at his luck; the beast faced away from him. He stepped lightly, careful not to make even the slightest sound, and stalked closer to the deadly creature.

The beast tensed, sensing something amiss with it's deadly senses. It shifted; a bright long run of steel caught the light; it's wicked talons curved around an elegant hilt.

Roland sprinted to close the distance as quickly as possible, but the beast heard him and fled into the forest. In his heedless rush, Roland stumbled on a root and smacked his head against a branch. He was sent sprawling head-first into the forest floor.

"Owwww..."

He scrambled to his feet, spat out dirt, and cursed his luck. He found his weapon half-buried under the forest detritus and then sprinted after the beast again, following the thunderous crash of its flight. He ducked and dodged where he must, but mostly ignored the clawing branches as he sped through them.

He almost ran it down before they both broke into the clearing they started from. The beast made it into the center of the glade and spun around, sword outstretched in an attack, though Roland was outside its reach.

“DIEEEEE, foul beast!” Roland roared as he jumped high and swung his blade in a long arc to bear down on the creature.

The beast dodged his attack and return its own. Roland dove to the side, hit the ground, rolled, and came back up to his feet with a triumphant smile. The beast rolled its eyes and pressed its attack, whipping its weapon back and forth. They traded blows in a flurry of attacks, parries, and blocks in an epic struggle that clacked and echoed throughout the glade.

But the beast was too slow and no match for the great beast hunter.

Sal winced at the blows. “Come on, Roland, back off a little.”

Roland could see the glint of fear in the beast’s eyes, and so he pressed his advantage. In a flurry of precise maneuvers, he forced the creature back, then disarmed it with an expert blow to its wicked claws.

“Ow!” The beast stared at Roland in utter astonishment.

Roland stared back, defiantly triumphant.

The beast should have wailed in defeat, or stomped in futile fury, or at least howl or something, anything to admit to admit how expertly it was defeated. Instead, it stared at him, oblivious to its own hopeless situation. And then, to Roland's horror, a wry smile tugged at the beast’s lips.

Roland threw his hands up. “Aren't you going to roar or something?”

“Roar.”

Roland’s face flattened. “You can’t just say roar.”

Sal chuckled. “Why not?”

“Because—“

“Have you seen your face?”

“Uh, what?”

Roland reached up to his face to find several leaves plastered to his cheeks and forehead. He pulled them off as Sal descended into full-blown laughter.

“And your teeth are black. How much dirt did you eat?”

He glared at Sal, then worked up enough spit to clean his mouth. He swished as best he could before spitting out what looked like black sludge. He stared at it surprise.

“Are you even capable of running through the woods without face planting?”

Roland looked back up and scowled. “I’m faster than you are.”

“You fall down a lot.”

“I’m still faster.”

“Yeah," Sal cocked his head and drew out the word, "but you’re taller.”

Roland shrugged and walked to the Whitewood, careful to duck under the sprawling branches. The limbs weren't sharp, but they wouldn't bend at all, the wood practically indestructible. His parents had forbidden him from going near the thing which, of course, made it that much more appealing; it was now his favorite spot.

He hopped up, grabbed a lower branch, then swung back and forth until his legs could latch onto the next branch over. He latched his the back of neck on the first branch, planked his body, carefully flipped over, stepped over the first branch, and settled into a straddle.

He reached down to offer his hand to Sal.

Sal gave him a skeptical look. "I'm hungry."

"So?"

"So," Sal repeated slowly, "I'm hungry."

"You said that already."

"Roland!"

"What? It's too early."

"It's eleven fourteen."

Roland rolled his eyes. "Sure."

"It takes us thirty-two minutes to make it to town—"

"Uh huh." Roland retracted his hand and looked up into the tree to plan his climb.

"—and at least twelve minutes to your house—"

"Yep." He reached up to the next branch.

"Plus another eleven minutes to—"

"You sure it's not twelve?" Roland looked over his shoulder, down at Sal, hand still on the next branch.

"You haven't even heard—"

"I'm just sayin', it could be twelve."

"Roland!"

"Fine," Roland huffed and abandoned his climb, "we'll just go then."

Problem was, Sal was almost certainly right. He had an impeccable and, some might say, unnatural sense of time. If Sal told him it was eleven-fourteen and thirty-eight seconds, then that was the time.

Roland straddled the branch again, then allowed himself to tip over until he was hanging upside down. He flashed Sal a grin. Keeping his hands wrapped around the branch, he loosened his legs and dropped his lower body so that his legs dangled. He dropped to the ground, turned around with flourish, and finished it with an elaborate bow.

"You're not as elegant as you think."

"Elegant?"

Sal rolled his eyes and walked off. Roland smirked at Sal as he ducked under the bleached branches.

Roland followed after carefully extricating himself from the Whitewood. His parents weren't exactly wrong about how dangerous they were, they were just wrong about his ability to handle said danger.

Mostly.

He jogged to catch Sal. “I wonder if Laurice like’s big words.”

“Shut it.”

Roland's eyes widened. “That's it, isn't it? You’re learning words to impress Laurice!”

“No.”

“That sounds like a yes.”

“No!” But Sal was turning red.

Roland began to sing. “Oh thine fair lady—“

“Shut up!”

“Doth my eyes—“

“Roland.”

“Shine for thee!”

“Your hurting my ears.” Sal had picked up his pace in a weak attempt to leave Roland behind.

“No wait. I’m sorry, I’ll stop.”

Sal looked over his shoulder, suspicious as Roland jogged to catch back up. They walked in silence for a bit and Sal began to relax.

“Sal and Laurice walking down the street— oof.”

Roland doubled over from the sucker punch Sal landed on his stomach.

“Serves you right,” Sal said as he walked away.

It took Roland a few seconds to regain his breath, then a couple more to ready himself. He sprinted and launched himself into the air just as Sal turned around. Sal’s eyes went wide — very satisfying — as Roland crashed into him and sent them both off the path into the mud beyond.

Roland was the first to make it back up until Sal kicked his legs out from under him. Sal almost made it up next, but his feet kept sliding out from under him, which might have been helped along with a kick or two from Roland. That backfired when Sal just allowed himself to fall back on Roland.

At this point, they both were laughing so hard neither could manage to get up if they tried. Instead, they laid on their backs and stared at the forest canopy while their laughter died into the occasional chuckle.

Roland sat up and groaned at the pain in his chest. “Okay, now I really am hungry,” he said, rolled over, and pushed himself to his knees, then shook his hands free of excess mud.

Sal pushed himself up and revealed an ugly bruise on his upper arm, new and purple. He quickly pulled down his sleeve to cover it.

“What—“

“No, it’s fine. It was my fault— oh no,”  Sal blanched and looked over his cloths. “No no no no.”  He began to frantically scrub at his clothes.

“Hey,” Roland grabbed his forearm, “it’s okay. Mom'll get it out... or dad will, depending on how angry he's made mom.”

Sal eyes were panicked. “If there’s even a stain—“

“It’s okay. We'll get it out, I promise.”

Sal closed his eyes and slowed his breath. After a few seconds, he opened them again and nodded.

Roland released his grip on Sal and motioned to the path. “Come on, it’ll be fine.”

They both set out for home and walked silently, each lost in their own thoughts. They broke through the tree line into a clearing near top of a hill that overlooked their valley. Nestled in a grassy vale and surrounded by wooded hills and the mountain ranges behind them, was Larstead. It wasn't a large town, but with just over a hundred buildings and homes, it wasn't a village either. All the buildings were well made, mostly stone, wood, and stucco. Between them cobblestone roads wound.

Only one road led out of town, where stone was quickly abandoned for hard-packed dirt that eventually gave up the pretense of even being a road. This path continued a long ways, more than a week's travel, often disappearing altogether only to reappear paces or leagues down the road, until it finally ended in Larstead's only neighbor, Edensville, who received Larstead's only export: wood.

Roland never understood why wood was so profitable — it was, quite literally, everywhere — but the town was prosperous for it. Most homes had gravtech lighting, stoves, and heating for winter. The town featured a central bath house near the town well, but from there led piping to some of the nicer homes, providing them with running water, of which Roland's house was one.

“Come on, I want to make it before your mom puts away the food,” Sal said.

Roland glanced over and then sprinted down the hill and into the forest at a pace that would have earned a scolding had his parents seen. He heard a distant ‘unfair!’ penetrate the wind from behind as Sal sought to catch up.
