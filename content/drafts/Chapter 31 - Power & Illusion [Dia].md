# 31 | Power & Illusion [Dia]

A yellow fitted tunic with pleated sleeves and obsidian buttons flared into a peplum. Black pants hugged Dia's waist down to her thighs before flowing into a loose island style that barely brushed the top of yellow closed-toed sandals. She pulled a black bucket hat over still-damp hair and shouldered a matching mini-purse.

Dia stared at herself in the mirror.

She had to admit, _Mother does know style._

She'd look half way decent if sunken eyes and dark rings didn't give away her exhaustion. After considering a few makeup options, she decided she didn't care. There was no one she wanted to impress, so she turned from the mirror and left her room.

In the foyer barely heard snippets of conversation drifted out from the parlor. While her mother had promised money, Dia had no intention of ensnaring herself in the inevitable social trap required to get it. Besides, she had more than enough money from the delve, even after Blackwater had reserved a portion for the Elderin supplies Dia.

On her way out, though, her eye caught something off on one of the stands next to the door. Her mother always made sure everything was perfectly placed, so any oddity stood out. She approached to find a stack of Rocs tucked under the vase.

Dia thumbed the stack of velvety paper, mentally guesstimating the total.

It was a lot, more than she'd ever allowed Dia before. Anger laced guilt began to churn through her stomach before she ruthlessly shoved it down. Yes, her mother was completely earnest in her desire— she truly wanted Dia to follow her footsteps, truly believed it the best.

Her mother never lied to Dia. She never sought to deceive her. Never thought to manipulate Dia the way she did others.

Dia never doubted her mother's intentions toward her.

And that made it all the worse.

No, her mother only wanted to shape her daughter into the lie she herself had become. She wanted to hollow Dia out, paint the facade, beggar the soul for the chance of something "better".

Even the idea of it pulled the walls in around Dia, pulled the air from the room, threatening to suffocate her.

Dia stared at the Rocs. _I love you mother, but I will never be you._

She tucked them into her purse and walked out the door.

A false twilight had thinned the crowds into a subdued hush. The straight fashion of middle class conformance had given way to more elaborate flowing styles of lace and silk, preening birds looking to be noticed. Dia inserted herself into a thin flow of humanity seeking to escape the suffocating confines of stacked homes carved into the mountain.

A five-minute walk brought her to an arching stone bridge wide enough for four to walk abreast. The opposing cliff was decorated much like the one she'd left, sporadic bright windows shedding weak light onto stone, failing to penetrate far into the dusk. Conflicted scents of a dozen cooked meals tugged at her nose while the snatches of excited murmurs from those outside mixed with the noise escaping from entombed family dinners.

Another ten minutes found Dia waiting in front of a large lift amidst a gaggle of sharply dressed youth. One small clump cast excited whispers while others tried painting a bored look on their face. Dia studiously ignored a few calculating glances cast her way.

The lift ride was free of drama. Just a slow ascent of regular stops as the rising room filled with hormone driven bodies. Dia had to control her breathing as they approached the top. Too warm. Too many bodies pressed in on her.

The floodgates finally broke, doors opening to relieve the pressure and send countless bodies spraying out into the hallways beyond. The spray quickly consolidated into a loose snake of people quickly walking to a common destination— there was really only one place to walk to this time of evening.

Dia allowed herself to be carried by the flow, slowing edging herself outward until she walked alongside the snake instead of in it. This level was above the crack, a single story concourse lined with shops. Only a smattering were still open, hoping to catch the eye of young fools with their parent's Rocs burning their pockets.

Most of it was baubles, jewelry, and the like. Empty promises to shore up the insecurities of those still looking for identity.

Or, if you were so inclined, the place to find perfect bribes for false friendships, all in the name of climbing a social ladder inherently rigged against those attempting the rise.

The high energy of the lower markets had been traded for the quiet of rustling fabric, whispering shoes, and murmured conversations. There were no callers, no shouts of offer or deal, only strategically placed displays cast out to lure in the self-conscious. Callers such as common to the lower markets would never be tolerated here, and perhaps such callers were never needed— none of the shops were empty, their displays peeling off a layer of skin from the snake as it passed.

Smaller hallways branched out every few hundred paces, their light dimmed to match the false twilight, store fronts sealed behind glass. They hinted at the vast complex that comprised the Respite markets.

The end of the concourse dumped the crowd out into a split staircase. The group split around the center, though most took the lower stairs with Dia. Cool air pushing back against them.

The stairs opened up into a long space with a low carved ceiling and square pillars lined up in even intervals. The space was walled in on three sides, with the fourth dropping several paces down into a tunnel that ran parallel the room. On the same wall as the stairs were painted the letters: "DA4-1 - Respite".

Everyone slowed at seeing the empty tunnel, most spreading out and flattening against an invisible line several paces from the edge. Others leaned against the pillars, idly chatting while waiting or watching others do the same.

Dia chose an empty spot further down and settled in to wait. The murmur of distant conversations flowed over her.

"...going now? Why not try..."

"...said she was going to Stonesend..."

"...can't stay, but maybe..."

Dia shut her eyes and tried to shut out the conversations. Exhaustion hit her, forcibly reminding her just how long the day had been.

_Eyes of hate, a gaping hole, blood in the mouth._

Dia's eyes snapped open. She inhaled sharply, her hand jerking to her mouth. It shook, and she forced her fingers into a fist, trying to calm her nerves. The memory faded quickly.

It was a lifetime ago and only seconds. Her mind bifurcated time into a paradox, insisting both were true. So long as her eyes stayed open, she could pretend it didn't happen, a distant memory.

Close her eyes, though, and... well, she wondered if she would ever sleep again.

_Sixty four cores spread over twin rails, eight per car. Two leads per car spaced less than a finger from the rail, feeding a reservoir connected to the lights within. Thirty-eight percent efficiency loss due to the gap._

Dia shook off the knowledge and stepped forward a moment before light wind began to push itself out of the tunnel. A whirring sound whistled from a distance, followed by a low thrum Dia felt in her bones. The wind howled right before first car emerged abruptly. It slowed, dragging the tones down until it stopped, leaving all eight cars perfectly spaced in the tunnel opening. The cars lowered themselves two fingers, aligning with the platform. Windowed doors silently slid open, two pairs per car, revealing a smattering of bored passenger idly holding wooden poles or else sitting on wall-lined benches under a warm light.

Steel bound wood and glass hiding thin strips of ancient graetech propelling cars at hundreds of paces per second. A marvel of ancient engineering, somehow still working despite thousands of years of use and virtually every part repeatedly replaced, aside from the graetech itself.

Dia stepped in and chose a pole near the door, ignoring a bored looking attendant as they idly checked over prospective passengers. Rails were free so long as you were from the proper class, and clothes made the class. Not that many from the warrens found themselves this high up the mountain.

Within short order, everyone had packed themselves into the railcars, allowing the driver to close the doors and accelerate to the next stop.

_Small flaws within the railcar leads generating dissonant bleed off, efficiency lost, and a lot of sound._

Dia twisted her lips as she leaned into the knowledge, revelling in the distraction.

It was an oddity of the rail system. Graetech was always silent. Or almost always. Railcars generated a lot of sound, proving to be the outlier. Nobody was sure why. Most who thought to think about it, which were few indeed, had written it off as a side effect of slowly failing tech. Others thought it the key to understand the ancient's secrets.

Nobody thought to suspect the leads.

Leads were only ever just leads. They had a simple task: take graescence and feed it to other devices. Yet these leads had small imperfections in them that "kicked back" the graescence they were supposed to take. This created a series of dissonances that reflected back and forth between the rails. They also just so happened to match perfectly the tones generated by railcars, plus a few others outside the range of hearing.

As Dia leaned into the knowledge, the imperfections within the leads formed a pattern in her head.

_Wow... yeah, very intentional. I wonder why—_

Someone bumped against her, breaking her out of her thoughts. She glared at his back, then realized he was exiting the railcar into the very station she needed to exit on. Dia startled again at realizing most everyone had already exited.

She jumped out as the doors were closing, exiting onto a platform identical to the one she'd left except for the large letters written on the back wall: "DA5-1 - Ocuras".

She hung back, allowing the flow of people to vacate the room. She watched as the last of them trotted up the stairs, eager to begin their nightly recreations. She stared at the empty stairs, hesitating. She was not looking forward to this.

"Heya, you look a little lost? Care for a guide? I know a few nice places, good food, great music, and all that."

Dia jumped, squawking out her surprise as she jerked her head in the direction the voice came from. A man— nope, a large _boy_ leaned against one of the pillars. He wore a black-buttoned white shirt, laced in the Teres style, and half open to expose what had to be hours of sculpting at the gym. Brown pants hugged his legs even more than hers did, but instead of flowing into the island styles, it tapered down to hug his ankles. He'd slicked his hair back into a helmet, and he was clearly striking a practiced laid-back pose he probably thought was sexy.

Dia's mouth fell slightly ajar as she took him in.

An oily grin spread across his face as he completely misinterpreted her expression. He opened his mouth—

"I am not lost." Dia turned and walked toward the stairs.

"Woah, don't be like that," he said as he pushed himself off the pillar and jogged to catch up. "I'm just trying to be nice."

"Go be nice to someone else." Dia increased her steps, hoping to outpace him.

"Listen now, Ocuras is a big place, easy to get lost in, ya know? I can get you where you need to be, ya hear me?"

"No."

Dia took the stairs hard, lips pressed tight, eyes forward, shoulders tense. She briefly considered taking the steps two at a time before dismissing it. She'd look desperate and her mother's warning had come to her unbidden: 'Panic all you want inside, just never let them see it or they'll pounce.' Although her mother had used considerably more words than that.

Dia's stalker had no such compunctions, bounding up the stairs two at a time until he passed her, angled to drive her toward the wall. He stuck out his arm, barring her way and, unbelievable, managed to strike yet another relaxed pose as he leaned against the wall, blocking her in.

She stopped abruptly, teeth grinding as she glared at him.

"Listen, it's clear we got off on the wrong foot here, ya? Lemme make it up to you. I know a place, nice place, quiet, ya know? Away from the crowds and all that. You don't seem like the kinda girl who likes crowds. You'll love it. Lemme show you. I bet we'll have—"

"Gods no! Go away."

Dia tried back up to move around but he just closed in on her, pressing in to invade what little of her personal space was left.

"Naw, now don't be like that. You're so tense! You need to loosen up, enjoy life, ya know? Come on now, I can help. I'm _great_ at relieving stress, ya hear me?"

"That's it," she growled.

Dia reached across for her purse but his arm snaked out and seized it before she could reach it. He gripped her wrist painfully, his smile turning predatory. He placed his other hand on her shoulder and began lightly caressing it, trailing finger toward her neck.

_Show no fear._

She returned his predatory smile, forcing a look of triumph on her face. Doubt flickered across his face; his eyes darted down, then widened at seeing her free hand in her purse. While he'd been distracted with one hand, she gotten the other in place.

Incredibly, it was enough.

Mr Stalker released his grip, throwing both hands into the air and backing up a step.

"Fuck, fine. You know what, I don't need you." He turned and began to walk up the stairs with forced casualness. "Enjoy singlehood," he said over his shoulder, "dried up little cunt."

Dia stood frozen, one arm half raised, the other stuffed painfully into her purse, balled into a fist, holding exactly nothing.

Nothing. She had no defense. It'd been a bluff, a desperate last ditch attempt to make him think she was dangerous. A gamble with nothing. An illusion moments from breaking.

Her mother was so certain that the illusion of power _was_ power.

_Fuck you, mother. Power is power._

And in that moment, while Dia was watching helmet head walk up the stairs, she made her decision. She'd intended her first project to be something simple, like a lamp, something to prove herself. Not anymore. She had a different kind of project in mind now, something far more dangerous.

Dia collapsed against the wall the moment he disappeared beyond the stairs. Adrenaline fueled trembles dragged her breath ragged. Humiliation, anger, _rage_ surged through her veins like fire. A scream built at the base of her throat, a burning fury desperately clawing its way out.

But she was still scared.

He might hear her. He might sense her vulnerability. He might come back.

So instead she slumped against the wall, swallowing her scream as tears silently leaked from her face.

It was just a couple minutes. Just long enough to ensure he was gone. Long enough for the adrenaline to fade, leaving her muscles gelatine. Long enough for exhaustion to drag her shoulder down. Long enough to become aware of herself, leaning against a wall in a public space blubbering her eyes out. Anyone could walk by, and soon the next railcar would dump out more idiots.

Dia pushed herself straight. She stuffed down the violation, the oily feeling of caressing fingers, the helpless fury.

The humiliation didn't fade, though. It lodged itself somewhere below her sternum, a festering rage that would never leave her.

Dia dried her face using the inside cuff of her sleeve, a place easily hidden, a trick her mother taught her— never let them see you cry. At least she hadn't used makeup—

_God's I'm a mess._

It was so absurd. So. fucking. absurd. She was haggard, exhausted, her face hollowed from a day that would. not. end. There was nothing attractive about her, nothing except the pretty clothes her mother had wrapped her in. Bloodshot eyes, dark rings, sunken cheeks—

And yet that hadn't stopped him in the least.

An unwilling bark of laughter bubbled from her lips, hysteria tinged madness.

_Deep breath_. She closed her eyes and slowly let out shaky air.

_Get yourself together._ She opened her eyes and began to walk up the stairs.

Ocuras was essentially a big cavern, clearly man made with a single four-story circular wall capped by a smooth dome so large it peaked nearly twelve stories. Not that anyone could easily tell.

The entertainment district was cast in perpetual night.

Another lie, of course.

A colorless starscape had been cast upon the dome, giving the illusion of a clear night sky— the feat idly tickled Dia's curiosity. Cleverly placed vents pushed through just enough warmed air to generate a constant light breeze along with thin strands of drifting artificial clouds. Below the night, a veritable city of riotous colors cast a echoing cacophony off the dome above. Elaborate stone, wood, and glass merged into thematic shapes that spilled color soaked light onto crowded streets. They were all lined up in neat rows, all preening for attention in so many hues the lack of consistency created its own theme. Within them, one could find just about any form of entertainment, diversion, or promises of satiated desire, no matter the source.

_I hate this place._

Dia began to weave her way through the central thoroughfare, a wide street filled with saturated colors and staggering laughter formed into clumps of people. The low pounding of drums escaped from a dozen establishments along with a hundred other instruments, music in so many styles it became simply noise. Alcohol mixed with food and burnt hash filled the air to create a uniquely unpleasant aroma.

Dia's stomach rebelled in response, clenching into pain it's displeasure. She ignored it, pushing through the crowds, intent on her destination.

Between two restaurants a man dressed in an out-dated style had setup an array of inverted buckets, using them to bang out an incredibly complex beat. In front of him was a small box, with only a smattering of small Rocs in it.

A small band had taken over a full block corner, playing a slow sultry sound made of bass drums and plucked strings. Before them a women danced, barely clothed in strips of silk and golden chain. Her movement were slow, sinuous, seductive, matching perfectly the music behind her. Her donation box was predictably overflowing.

Dia suppressed a shudder as group of inebriated youth began loudly shouting catcalls and lewd comments. They only had a few moments before several large men seemed to materialize around them and guided them away for a polite "conversation" on the benefits of manners.

She continued on past cross-streets named after various alcohols, exotic drugs, foods, music styles, and... other activities. The establishments didn't always match their street's namesake, but Dia kept her eyes firmly straight ahead as she passed Sensual— it wasn't just the female persuasion on display there... or the male for that matter. There were all sorts in the world.

Dia turned down Gin and began working her way toward the wall. The street was predictably lined with bars, with the occasional restaurant thrown in for good measure. They were all quite a bit more upscale than most other streets. Smartly dressed bouncers casually policed small lines of supplicants seeking entry. There were no questionable puddles, rowdy flocks of hormone driven boys, or staggering drunks slaloming the street. No, too many menacing bouncers with sharp eyes and short tempers were stationed here for that sort of thing. They put up with little.

Of all the establishments in the entertainment district, Echoes was unique in that it wasn't actually in Ocuras. Echoes wasn't build of wood or stone within the dome, it was carved out the side of it. Still only half way down Gin and Dia could easily make out the scalloped archways taking up the entire height of the wall.

Gin, like all streets, ended abruptly about a hundred paces from the wall. There were no lines for Echoes— you were either let in, or your weren't —but some people loitered about, standing in small groups or sitting on benches around one of the several water features dotting the area. Dia ignored them, aiming for the entrance. She had no doubts she would be let in— mother knew her business.

"Dia!"

Dia slowed, eyes scanning people until she found Kalina waving at her. Malek and Moore were sitting edged on the corner of a fountain basin. At the sight of her, Moore punched Malek, then flipped over his hand. Malek seemed to grumble, but nevertheless pulled out several Rocs and handed them over.

Dia frowned as she turned to walk to them.

_Did they bet on me coming!?_ She couldn't decide if she was flattered or insulted. _Hmmm... both. Malek's still an ass, but Moore bet for me— that brute has a heart of gold._

Kalina's bright smile faltered a little as Dia approached.

"Dia, I... just. Wow. You look— I mean, I've never... Gods just _wow_, you look _incredible_."

Dia's confusion gave way to realization as Kalina began fawning over Dia's attire.

_She's never seen me dressed proper. I've always been wearing my... disguise._

The poorest clothes she could get her hands on, in other words.

"Why are you out here?" Dia said, hoping to change the subject.

"Fuckers wouldn't let us in," Malek said all too loudly, "as though our Rocs are somehow less. Just said," he lowered his voice, "'sorry, no.'" Malek jerked his head, "so fucking polite while snubbing the ever living shit out of us."

"Gods Malek," Kalina turned on him, "could you be more rude?"

Malek looked piqued until Moore placed a hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently. That seemed to calm him down, to Dia's utter bafflement.

She turned to Kalina and cocked her head.

"They wouldn't let you in?"

"Nya uh. Took one look at us and pointed the other way."

Dia opened her mouth, then paused. She shifted her perspective, changing the people before her from friends she'd known for years, to stranger dressed in—

"Oh..."

Kalina was stunning, a true beauty. Dia couldn't hope to match her, not even with the latest in perfectly tailored clothes. But then, that was the point. While Kalina wore a sensual dress that accentuate her curves and brought out her beauty, who wore dresses anymore? And there were other clues in the way it pinched in certain places, loose in others. It fit... but only mostly. It would take a tailor to adjust it properly, and that would cost more than the dress.

The boys likewise looked great— better even than Dia thought they could manage. But the cuts were wrong, the pants just a little too baggy, their jacket lapels too big and at the wrong angle.

A glance was all you needed to realize they didn't belong.

Kalina look turned hard. "What do you mean, 'oh'?"

Dia sighed. "Come on, we'll find somewhere else to—"

"No!" Kalina spouted in outrage, "this was _our_ celebration. You... you were there. You know what we went through. We deserve this!"

"Umm... okay...?"

"Can you get us in? Like now? There's a creepy old guy that's been staring at us the whole time."

Dia looked around but didn't see anyone obvious.

"Don't look around!" Kalina shifted a couple steps. "Over my left shoulder, in the shadows— _other_ left. Yeah, see him?"

Dia finally spotted him standing by a corner over a hundred paces away. He wasn't actually old— middle aged at most —but he was staring at them quite intently.

_Why does he look familiar?_

Perhaps at seeing Dia's gaze, he chose that moment to walk toward.

"Oops, time to go."

Dia turned and walked toward the door without waiting for a response. Kalina gestured at the boys, who reluctantly pushed themselves off the stone to follow.

As they approached the entrance, Kalina turned to Malek.

"One word, and I swear you'll permanently sing in falsetto the rest of your life."

Dia barked out a small laugh, then schooled her face as they approached the bouncer. The one on the right glanced at her, then her three friends, then back at her. He raised a questioning eyebrow.

"They're with me."

He hesitated a moment, then shrugged, reached over, and then politely opened the door for them.

"What the fu—"

Kalina rounded on Malek, face full of fury. Dia saw true fear in his eyes as he slowly closed his mouth.

Dia glanced back but saw no sign of the man following them.
