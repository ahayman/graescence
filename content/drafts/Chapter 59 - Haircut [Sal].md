# 59 | Haircut [Sal]

Sal jumped up, patting his empty sheath, and tried to move into a fighting stance, but his legs and feet were still tied up and he barely managed to not fall over. Reesh startled at the motion and took a step back, looking confused.

He glanced at his knife and guffawed. "Oh, ha! Sorry. I ah, I ain't gonna cut you kid. Just ah... here, take it. Cut yourself free."

Reesh flipped the knife over, caught it by its tip, and then offered the hilt. Sal stared at it for a second, then slowly took the knife. He sat and sawed at the rope binding his legs.

"I'll go tell the others." He kicked the canvas bag. "We'll figure this shit out later."

He grabbed Sal's bag from next to a crate and thrust it at Sal's chest. Then he he simply walked out, leaving Sal feeling cast adrift.

"Hey," Shora gave him a small smile, "you need a place to land?"

Sal slowly pried his eyes away from the door.

He screwed up his face. "A what?"

She giggled, "Come one, let's grab some eats. My treat. Somethin good." Her smile turned lopsided while she shook her head. "Kinda need it after all this, you know?"

Sal stared, his face still twisted up in confusion as Shora walked away without waiting for a reply.

"What is going on?" Sam mumbled as he resheathed his knife.

Shora stopped after a few steps and looked back. "Hey you comin or what?" She jerked her head toward the door and began walking.

Sal had no idea what to do. Stay here? That was absurd. So he threw his bag over his shoulder and just followed, feeling remarkably like a lost puppy dog.

He stumbled to a stop when they stepped outside. His jaw dropped as his head was inexorably drawn upward. He'd tried to imagine what it was like, but imagination had failed him. He was in the city, standing beneath an entire other city which blocked the sky— no, it _was_ the sky.

He'd thought of them as roads connected between the spires, and yes, there were roads. But thousands upon thousands, webbed such that they created an inscrutable network— and how _wide_ were those roads? So far up, and he realized they weren't so much as roads as they were entire strips of city, possibly even blocks wide. But more, there were entire... plates between many of the roads, entire city sections. Though patches of blue could be seen, the city above covered most of the sky. Many of the lower streets above emitted a soft glow, which was in fact street lights reflected from the ones below.

"The Uppers."

Sal turned to the girl beside him. "The what?"

"Hmm, Uppers. You know, like the 'up there'? People live their entires lives there."

"Uppers, right," Sal said, distractedly looking up.

"Yep. Guess where we are?"

"Uh..." Sal glanced up, then back at her.

"The _lowers!_"

"The... lowers."

"Yep," she grinned at him. "Can you guess why!?"

"...wow."

"I know, right?" She blinked at him, a broad smile on her face that only looked slightly sarcastic. "Okay, food?"

"Sure?"

"Great! I know just the place."

She turned on heel and walked away. Sal stared at her for three seconds, sighed, and jogged to catch up, then matched her pace. They walked through an endless array of run down buildings that all looked the same, three story wood lined by windows at the top and alternating doors with bays on the ground. Most were closed up, but some were open, and in them people worked. It was one of the templates, plopped down in sequence.

They passed bays were filled with crates, same as the one they'd just left. Workers were either opening or closing them up, or perhaps just moving them around. Some were stacked out front, being loaded onto pallets or sleds.

They had to step around an older man as he pulled one of the bay doors open. Each of the doors folded out flat against the building, and Sal couldn't help but notice that one of the bay door partially blocked the side entrance. Inside, Sal caught a glimpse of random junk stacked up in tall piles.

Another bay had chairs stacked ten high, three deep along one edge, lumber on the other. In the middle was a workbench with an man hunched over a chair leg, carefully sanding it down. Someone else was moving further back, hidden in the deeper shadows. An apprentice perhaps, a son or daughter. It took only five seconds to pass them buy, so Sal never saw.

They were just people, living their life. They didn't worry about assassins or Inquisitors— probably never even saw one. It never occurred to them that some godling might just wipe them all out. Why would it? They lived in the grandest city in the world, under a whole other city suspended in the sky.

But Larstead had a whittler. He also made chairs, among other things. Sal couldn't remember his name, but he remembered his face. The man was bereaved when his wife died giving him two sons, twins. They were older than Sal and always seemed quiet, sullen, not one of the ones who liked to torment him. They didn't live under another city, but in the mountains. And they would have lived the same as the whittler he'd just passed, no matter the view. Or, they would have had a godling not wiped them clear off the world.

It took twenty-four minutes and four turns to leave the district. When they did, Sal stumbled. Beyond was what he could only describe as colored chaos. People milled and loitered about colored stalls of pink, orange, red, blue, and other colors Sal couldn't think to name. The light mixed and clashed in saturated colors, screaming for attention, spilling onto a street permanently shadowed in the city above.

It wasn't night, but it almost felt like it. The lights were bright in the shadow of the city, and once night came the colors would be all that defined the place. For now it existed in a weird colored half-light, darker than an overcast day, a day of twilight.

Music also spilled out from a nearby bay, a deep rhythmic thumping of bass drums mixed with horns and strings to a fast beat. Sal stared as they walked by three consecutive bays whose adjoining walls had been torn down, all spilling out the same music. Seating was clustered around tables underneath a patio overhang attached to each of the bays. Inside the colors deepened into blacks, where shadows moves in rhythm.

"They're always playin," Shora said, slowly shaking her head in mock shame. "No idea why. Like they got nothin else better to do."

Aromas of spiced food wafted in the air, competing with the light and music for attention. Sal's stomach growled as they passed small food stalls, all with pictograms of what they they were selling. Only a few bothered to write out descriptions.

They continued on, passing alleys both dark and colorful, some cluttered or narrowing into dead ends, others wide with throngs of people milling and moving about their business. Most seem to be simply be walking through, although few were very clearly under some level of intoxication.

It took Sal a while to realize this section of the city was yet another template stamped over and over in a repeating pattern of uniformity. Except here humanity had torn down, built up, painted, customized, and modified each building so as to make them unrecognizable.

Shora turned down a path made of dirt ground wood planks, creaking under foot. Sal was certain it had once been one of the templated buildings, torn down to make a wide alley connecting two streets but with the flooring left as a board walk. After twenty paces, the flooring stepped down into stone. Behind the adjacent buildings was a fence, and between the slats he could see a courtyard of stone. They continued through the bones of another house, where the stubs of blackened wood rose barely a pace, the only bones left of the house.

They turned left down a new street lit by bright yellow lights. This one seemed entirely devoted to food, though instead of food stalls, restaurants had been setup in the bays themselves. The past two restaurants taking up four bays, before Shora veered in to a single bay on the right, dominated by an muted orange glow.

The bay had been divided into half by a counter top lined with bar stools. A few tables were scattered around both inside and out front. Behind the counter was a heavyset man, pale skin, greasy hair, and ample girth. He wore a white undershirt and gray pants, with a dirty apron over both. He was bent over a pot with something boiling inside it.

Shora jumped up on one of the stools and rapped the counter with her knuckles.

"Hey Strath, special on the house!"

The cook, Strath, glanced back at Shora and grunted.

"You got the creds, you get the special," he said, turning back to his cooking.

Shora face turned to mock horror. "Aww, come on now. Don't be like that. We gotta show our friend here the best of the best."

Strath looked askance at Sal. "You takin in strays now, Sho? Auntie won't like that. She's gotta full house already."

"It's _Shora_," she said, brow drawn, emphasizing the syllables, "And we kinda put him in a bind, Strath. Gotta make it up, you know? Figured I'd show off some of the best cooking in the quarter."

"Uh huh," he looked at her for four seconds. "Fine. Two for one special, only ten creds."

Sal looked up at the board, which clearly said: 'Noodle and Meat Special - 5 Creds.'

"So that's how you're gonna play it?" Shora eyes narrowed, though Strath looked unimpressed. "Six creds and you make it good, extra meat you know, and he might just come back."

"Eight creds, cash now."

"Nine creds, I'll pay you later."

"Ten and you pay me later."

"Deal!"

Shora stuck out her hand, grinning. Strath looked at it, rolled his eyes, and turned back to his cooking. What Sal couldn't figure out, is why all that if she was going to pay the full price anyway.

Shora leaned over, whispering too loud in a conspiratorial tone, "You see. You get em to put it on the tab, and let that tab build up. Then, after it's gone all nice and juicy, you ah— what's the word? — oh! Right: _Negotiate._"

"I heard that."

"You heard nothin, cook! Where's my food!?"

Strath shook his head and pulled out a clump of noodles he kept in a side bin. He threw them on a flat griddle and ladled some oil over it. He placed his hand on a nob near the side of the griddle, feeding graescence to heat it. Once the noodles started to sizzle, he threw veggies and strips of meat next to them.

Sal turned to Shora. "What is going—"

"Hey so what's your name, anyways?"

He blinked slowly. "Sal..."

Shora's face scrunched. "Just... Sal? That's it? Like, _Sal._" She cocked her head and lowered her voice. "Hey, I'm just... Sal."

"W... what wrong with my name?" He _hated_ his full name and refused to ever speak it. Even his father wouldn't use it. Said his mother named him after a color, or maybe a fish. Either way, it was one of the few things he and his father agreed on.

"I dunno. It's fine, I guess. Just short, you know. Like, you need more letters."

"Ha!" Strath guffawed as he shook spices all over everything, "like you know letters."

"Hey now! I know some letters. Some. Enough. I know Sal ain't got many letters in it."

Sal's brow climbed. "You don't know how to read."

He said as a statement, a little bit in shock. He'd known it wasn't common, if only because Djrek had told him, but that was more like a statistic. He wasn't sure he'd ever met someone who couldn't read before.

"Naw, why would I?"

"Cause it's how you learn."

She screwed up her face at him. "Learn what? I know all I need. What do you learn from books I don't know?"

Sal opened his mouth but what could he say? Learn math? History? If she didn't need to read, she probably didn't need to know algebra, and he doubted she cared much about history. Fiction, stories? But he suspected that was something _rich_ people did. In fact, he was sure of it. The only people who'd ever had books for him to 'trade' with were always well off.

"Lay off the kid, Sho," Strath said, plating the food, "Some just take to it is all. Nothin wrong with it."

"I'm not a—"

"It's _Shora_. Dammit, you want me call you Stra?"

Strath shrugged, chuckling. "Don't bother me none," he said, plopping two plates on the counter.

Sal stared skeptically at the plate of food, heavily spiced noodles, veggies, and meat drenched in oil. The noodles were still sliding around as they settled.

"Well I don't like it," Shora said while chewing. She swallowed. "A proper name has more letters to it. Sho ain't a name. It's... more like sound, you know? Ashora is better, but I can't get anyone to call me it."

"It's also not your name."

"Yeah well, it should be," she mumbled between bites.

Sal stared at his plate, untouched. He looked pained. "What is going on?"

"What dya mean? We're eatin."

"Think the kid's confused, Sho."

Shora glared at Strath, pinched lips, eyes narrowed.

So did Sal. "I am _not_ a kid."

Strath threw up his hands, his face suppressing a grin poorly. "Sorry. My mistake." He turned back to his griddle and started cleaning it.

Sal exploded. "Thirty six minutes ago, I was bound up after you attacked a pair of Inquisitors and ki— _abducted_ me. And now you want me to... eat lunch?"

"Yeah?" Shora looked bewildered. "So?"

Strath turned slowly and levelled at Shora. He spoke slowly. "You did _what?_"

Shora looked back and forth between them. "What!? It was just a gig."

"That ain't a gig. That's suicide, Sho. You don't attack the blacks, Sho— _no one_ attacks the blacks."

Her face turned rebellious. "You do for twenty mil."

"Oh come on—"

"Twen. Ty. Mil, Strath."

"You are smarter than this, girl," Strath shook his head. "No one pays that. You gotta know it was bad." He pointed at Sal, glaring at Shora. "And if he's here, then you got nothin. Am I wrong?"

Shora's head fell. "Not nothin," she mumbled.

"And the blacks? They'll come for you."

Her head snapped up. "Not if they can't find us they won't. We wore masks and," She lifted up her board, which had been propped against the counter, "they can't track this."

"And you're sure about that?"

She lifted her chin and swallowed hard. "...yes."

Strath looked doubtful. He jerked his head toward Sal. "And him?"

"We did him a favor. They were gonna make him a gray, Strath. Him!? Can you believe that?"

Strath looked at Sal again, but he did not look disbelieving. If anything, he looked wary.

His eyes narrowed on Shora. "This boy could bring down the whole of the black tower down on us. You ask him what he want?"

"...no. But he don't even know what a gray was. I'm tellin you, we did him a favor."

Strath shook his slowly in disappointment. He turned back to Sal and stared hard at him. Sal began to squirm.

After five seconds, "I won't say anything, I swear."

Strath's lips pressed, but after another four second he nodded sharply.

"You seem like a good kid. Just... Shora is right. You don't wanna be a gray. They die. And if they don't, they come out... wrong." He turned to Shora, looking tired. "And what they actually give you? Cause it sure as hells wasn't twenty mil."

Shora's face fell. "Hash," she said quietly, "bricks of it."

Strath growled through his teeth, "Yeah, they would." He sighed. "That's what you kids don't get. Twenty mil ain't a score, not for people like us. It's a trap. It's _always_ a trap."

Shora glared at Strath. "You sound like Auntie."

Sal looked back and forth between Strath and Shora and decided he should be as quiet as possible. Also, he was hungry, even if it did have loads of oil on it. After a few bites he amended his opinion. Yes, it was greasy, but it was also really, really good. He began scarfing it down in a way that would make Roland proud.

Shora's clenched her jaw. "It was supposed–"

"Who's your point?"

"...Reesh."

"Damn fool. They're gonna send the boots after you. You know that, right? The blacks may not know where you are, but you _did_ get paid, even if it was hash. An whoever paid you ain't gonna be pleased."

"I know, but Reesh said he'd deal with it."

"Uh huh, I'm sure he did. You just lay low."

"You ain't my pa."

"You ain't _got_ no pa. That's the problem. I know auntie means well but there are shelters—"

"Oh come on! You know what those are like."

Strath threw up his hands, "Alright! You right. I know. I just... I just don't wanna hear about you dead is all. Lay low, _please_, Shora."

Shora turned her head away from him while he stared at her, waiting. After twelve very awkward seconds, she jerked her head in something like a nod.

Sal looked up from his food. "What's hash?"

They both turned to him, brows raised.

Shora opened her mouth slowly, "How..."

"Where you from, boy?"

"...do you not know what hash is?"

Sal's eyes darted between them. "Because I... just don't?"

"Pha!" Strath laughed out suddenly, then turned to Shora, "he's your project. You tell em."

And with that he turned back to his grill, though he kept his head tilted as though to hear. Shora worked her mouth for a bit.

"Right, well... hash. Okay, so hash is like a drug, right? It makes everything bright? I think... it ah, well, it's not good for you but lot's of people are on it and—"

"Oh dear forsaken gods," Strath exclaimed, "pigs are butchered less than that your explanation."

Shora scrunched her face up at him, "Fine! _You_ tell him."

Strath leaned, placing both hands on the counter.

"Hash is a drug— she's right about dat —an it make you feel good; makes everything bright, yeah, but more? It makes you feel full, powerful. And that? That grabs ya. It grabs ya hard an won't let go." He pushed off the counter and began pacing. "Thing is, soldiers use it. An they use it for good reason. Good, good reason." He spun to face Sal. "You know why? I'll tell you why. Cause it makes you powerful." He nodded to himself. "That ain't no lie. It pumps you up, fill you to the rim, so much you gonna burst. So much you've gotta let it out. An that's why soldier us it, you see? A soldier, average like ya know, can only fire off maybe three or four off them lances they got. But with hash? Hash changes everything. With hash, it's not three or four. With hash is ten or twelve." He leaned on the counter again, levelling an intense look at Sal. "An that? That saves ya. For a soldier, hash is what keeps you livin." His gaze turned distant. "But if you let it, it _becomes_ livin. Nothin else matters. Just the hash."

"Come on, Strath. He don't wanna hear about your—"

"But here's the thing," Strath continued, seemingly unaware of Shora, "hash makes. you. powerful. You get me? You know what I mean?" He looked up at the city above them. "Watcha think powers all that, huh? Where you think all that sweet sweet graescence comes from? I'll tell you. It comes from us. They pay you, you know. It ain't much, just maybe enough to live on. But!" He raised a finger. "But whatcha think happens if you take hash, huh? Whatcha think?"

Sal waited four seconds before he realized the question wasn't rhetorical.

"It... makes you powerful?"

"Yes!" he rapped his knuckles on the counter four times. "It. Makes. You. Powerful. You walk in to one of their feeders, an without hash you just might walk away with enough to feed yourself. Maybe. But with hash? With hash you can walk away with thrice that, easy. Fuck, if they know you're using hash, they might just give you a little extra. Incentivise, you know? So you do it, thinkin you're making out. Maybe, just maybe, you live an large like, feeling good. And the hash makes you feel it. It feels _good_ to feed the system. That's the thing. It feels fuckin good. An you keep doin it, right? Cause why not? You gettin paid; you feelin good. The world's on your side, you know?"

And suddenly Strath's face turned dark, haunted even.

"An who gives a fuck if yo kid is starving in the street? Who give a fuck if they die? Who gives a fuck if they got no parents, right? Cause who fuckin cares? You got your high. You got yo money. You got all you need feedin the fuckin system."

Strath slammed his hand down on the counter, pushed off, turned to his griddle, and began scrubbing it with such vigor that Sal wondered whether he would have a griddle left when he was done.

Shora had shrunk into herself during Strath's tirade. She stared at his back, food forgotten. She looked conflicted, angry, sad. Without a word, she slid off her stool and tugged on Sal's arm. He looked at his plate, half eaten, and realized he'd lost his appetite. So he allowed her to drag him off his seat and then out. She never let go his hand.

They continued on through what Sal was thinking of as the food district, just as colorful as the... 'music' district. They probably had proper names. Or not. They were close to a city center, a hub, or what he'd once thought of as copses of trees amidst the grass— the metaphor felt thin though. Its towers were a silhouette of light-spackled grey against the shadowed monstrosity of one of the spires behind it.

They walked parallel to the hub, seeming almost aimless. Shora let go his hand and stuck her own into pockets, shoulders hunched. She randomly kicked at nothing as they walked.

"He's tryin to cook his way to forgiveness, you know?" Shora said without looking up. She kicked at clump of dirt built up on the side of the street, but it was hard packed and didn't budge. "He pretends to put it on the tab; we pretend we're gonna pay. He's trying to— he's..." she shrugged, "Guess he figures he feeds enough of us, maybe it'll make up for his own kid, you know?"

"Like... you?" Sal guessed.

She glanced at him. "Yeah, we're all like that. I mean, maybe my parents are alive? I dunno. Don't care. Never knew em. Probably better that way. Jin knew her parents. She _remembers_... and I think it hurts more that way, you know? Is why she's so angry all the time." She twisted her lips in thought. "Or maybe she's just that way. I dunno." She glanced over at Sal and hesitated. "Sorry. I didn't mean to bring it all down. You..." she snorted, "I don't even know you, not really, right? You've barely said ten words; I've dragged you all over the place; didn't mean to dump on you; just that, you didn't know, you know? Hash. And it's sore talk is all. And—"

"My father used to beat me," Sal interrupted.

Shora looked over, a little startled, and slowed to a stop. He wasn't sure why he said that. Perhaps that she'd been so open. And an almost bipolar swing from sugary bravado into sullen gloom that threw him off guard. Or perhaps it was that he _didn't_ know her, and she didn't know him. And it made it easier somehow to be vulnerable, with no history to judge the other by.

"He'd get drunk a lot. Then he'd get angry at me, cause I wasn't good enough. I wasn't mom. But she'd died and left him with me. He hated me for it." Sal shrugged, like it was nothing. "I think if I'd had hash, I'd have given it to him. Made him disappear."

She snorted softly, and gave him a lopsided grin. "Guess the edges can be shit too, huh?" She shouldered him, knocking him lightly. "Yeah, you'll fit in, I think. Come on."

She walked on, and he kept pace. She was wrong, though. He didn't fit in; he couldn't— he'd already found his place, and it was within a black tower he couldn't see from here. But perhaps he could pretend, if only for a little.

They walked out of the food district in silence, fading from bays to residences slowly. He saw more and more residential buildings interspersed, until he realized the bays were gone. There wasn't any sort of hard line, yet he thought there might have been once. It was just stuff was burnt down, rebuilt, or whatever, and the neat templated structures ceased to be neat.

She turned left down an alley and led him four streets over. Another right and they were in a purely residential district with a surprising number of people loitering about, especially children. Unsupervised mostly, unless the casual glances made by adults not really nearby counted. They played as children do, with games of chase, laughter and screaming in equal measure echoing lightly.

They passed a girl playing with the light of a nearby street lamp, casting shadows on the wall of the nearest house. A gaggle of children had gathered around her as she used her hands to draw shapes with light and shadow. She was speaking dramatically, telling a story, while the others giggled, laughed, or watched in silence. Sal slowed his pace, watching. She was enacting some fight scene with remarkable dexterity, though he wasn't sure of the topic.

They continued and passed a drajin drawn sled, but the drajin looked old and tired. It padded slowly down the road, and neither the drajin nor the driver seemed much in a hurry. The sled was filled with potatoes.

The streets were lit by the occasional lamp, to far a piece to properly cover the area, yet almost necessary in a city perpetually covered in shadow.

The took another right, working down an alley for three streets, then continued left again. This street had more older youth than children, most of which were older than Sal. It was dirtier, with discarded trash collected along the edges. A few of the homes were rundown, dilapidated, missing windows and even a door, yet still occupied. The young loitered. Many looked to have claimed some random spot as their own piece of territory, guarding it with both the arrogance and laziness of a cat.

They continued down the street past a dozen homes and stopped at a random home. It was two stories, no balcony, but barred windows. Old wood painted a light gray that still looked sturdy. A low iron fence protected a dead yard all of ten paces deep. A second glance revealed the fence guarded more than one yard. Three in fact. It was the only indication that the three homes were, in fact, joined into one.

Teens sat out front, less loitering and more suspiciously like stationed guards, for all they were youth. Shora met their eyes. One gave her an almost imperceptible nod and shifted his attention back outward, nconcerned, bored but attentive.

She walked through the pair and to the house. Sal followed, glancing at the 'guards', but they didn't acknowledge him. They didn't seem to care he existed, though that would probably change if he'd approached alone.

They walked into a foyer, and it was surprisingly clean. Sal would have expected more dirt given the general state of the neighborhood, but instead he was greeted with polished wood and swept floors. They _were_ worn, but that only gave it a warm, lived in feeling. Clearly, whoever owned the place valued cleanliness.

"Shoes off!"

The decidedly female, _not_ teenage voice sounded from an adjacent room, overriding the sound of other conversations that drifted in. Sal didn't even think. He just immediately pulled off his boots and arranged them next to the door with practiced motions.

Shora stared at him with approaching exasperation, as though he'd unwittingly lost a battle for her. She sighed, shaking her head, then rolled her eyes. Finally, she began yanking at her boots.

The deja vu hit Sal hard and, for a moment, it wasn't her but Roland yanking his boots off, inadvertently slinging mud in his carelessness. Sal flinched, feeling memory's knife slide deep into his heart.

A women walked in and stopped, mouth open as though to shout. She was older, perhaps 30's, thin, dark skinned with straight silky black hair that spoke of countless hours of work. It framed an face with high cheek bones, hard jaw, and prominent nose. She had a no-nonsense vibe to her.

The woman's mouth snapped shut when she saw Shora. Her brow lifted at Shora's one boot sitting next to Sal's, the other half way off her foot. Her eyes trailed to Sal, then narrowed slightly in a considered gaze.

"Come in now."

She turned and disappeared into the room she'd come from. Shora scrunched up her face and stuck her tongue out silently at the woman's back. She tossed her remaining boot, bouncing off the door where it landed atop Sal's boots. His hand twitched.

Shora jerked to a stop as they walked in, almost as if struck. Guilt and dread flashed across her face. Sal almost walked into her. He glanced at her, then took in the room.

Half a dozen teens of several ethnicities were in the process of tearing apart the room and boxing it up, though they'd only started. Four crates of wood lined the back wall, two empty, one sealed, the other half full. A low counter lined the wall opposite of them, and in front of it was a wooden swivel chair. A few regular chairs lined the wall opposite.

The woman, whom Sal was pretty sure was 'Auntie', looked at Sal and gestured to one of the chairs.

"Sal, is it?" she said politely with a thin smile, "Please have a seat."

Sal startled, then jerked to look at Shora, who was the only person he'd told his name to. Shora pointedly looked away, swallowing hard, seeming to shrink into herself.

"You," Auntie spoke sharply to Shora, "_sit._" She gestured to the swivel chair.

Shora hesitated, and for a moment Sal thought she might run. Her jaw worked but after six seconds of enduring Auntie's glare, she huffed and stomped her way to the swivel chair. She plopped in, breathing heavy, looking both defiant and remarkably like someone readying themselves for an execution.

Sal slowly walked to his chair, having to squeeze his way through a mass exodus of youth who'd decided they had better things to do, anything, anywhere but here. The chair creaked when he sat.

Auntie walked past Shora to the counter, and began doing... something, her back blocking the view. Shora fidgeted, looking twice over at the door with fear-tinged longing. She was moments from bolting, and Sal thought she'd do it screaming in terror.

Auntie turned suddenly, hands fitted with thin leather gloves that were covered in a thick, pungent white cream. The room filled with the overbearing scent of mint mixed with lye.

The moment she saw the gloves, Shora literally jumped out of her chair, causing both it and her to tip over.

"No no no no no!" She scrambled away on her hands and knees, but her foot had snagged on the chair, which was dragging behind her.

"Ha!" Auntie lunged at her and buried her fingers into Shora's hair.

Shora let out such a scream of horror, outrage, and disgust that Sal was half way out of his chair, hand on the hilt of his knife. He did not draw it, though it was a close thing.

He slowly sat back down while Auntie used her knee to pin Shora down and very thoroughly rub the cream through her hair. Shora snarled inarticulate sounds somewhat reminiscent of a wounded animal. She tried to reach back and scratch, hit or maim— anything really —but Auntie just slapped her hands away.

Only after every strand of hair was covered in pungent grease did Auntie get up, looking serenely satisfied. She removed one glove, calmly strutted to the overturned chair, righted it, and placed it precisely center of a burnished mirror still setup on the wall. Shora lay on the floor as though dead for twenty three seconds, the only signs of life the rhythmic sound of breath that was more huffs through her nose.

When Shora pushed herself off the ground, Sal was pretty sure he'd just witnessed a crime. Then, when he Saw the look on her face, Sal became certain he was moments from witnessing a murder. However, Shora simply lifted her chin and calmly walked to the chair, her posture oddly mimicking Auntie's, almost regal except for her eyes, which promise revenge and unending pain.

Auntie retrieved a thick comb from the counter and began attacking Shora's hair.

"Now," Auntie said, yanking on curls while the hair began to relax, "speak."

"Was just a gig."

"_Just_ a gig."

"Yeah. Just. a. gig."

"Except this gig didn't come through me, now did it?"

Shora pinched her lips, refusing to speak.

"Why then don't you tell me what this gig was all about, seein as how it was all done without me."

Sal frowned, pretty sure Auntie already knew everything about the gig, especially given she knew his name. And indeed, as Shora mechanically threw out the details about a twenty mil gig for a 'snatch and grab', Auntie showed not even a hint of surprise. When Shora finished, Auntie took a step back and slapped the girl upside the head, hard.

"Ow!"

Auntie grimaced at her hand, which was covered in the cream. She walked to counter and began wiping it with a towel.

"Do you know why all gigs come through me?"

"Because you're a b—"

Auntie spun, eyes flashing fury. "_Finish_ that sentence. I dare you."

Shora bit off the word, then her lip. She huffed but said nothing more.

Auntie took a deep breath. "There are good gigs, there are bad gigs, and then, Shora, there are traps. You know this."

"But Auntie, twenty mil—"

"_is_ a trap!" Auntie yelled. She put her hands on her hips and cocked her head, one eyebrow raised. "You get paid?"

"No! Well..."

Aunties eyes flashed. "Yeah, exactly: 'well'. What they pay you, Shora?"

"...hash," Shora mumbled.

"Mm hmm. And what you think—"

"—but Reesh is gonna get rid of it. He said—"

"Think girl. You are not this dumb. Reesh ain't gonna get rid of it. He _can't._"

"But he left it and—"

"Course he did. You think Jin would let him take that shit? That girl would beat him to a bloody pulp. Remmy too, for that matter. No, he pretended to leave it, girl. He ain't stupid. He'll gather a core, come back and get the hash, then setup shop."

"But Reesh wouldn't—"

"Reesh ain't got no choice!" Auntie yelled. "He can't give it back. It don't work like that. So he's gotta take it, and he's _gotta deliver_. Do you hear me? Do you understand? Cause if he don't, they'll make him pray for Jin's worst. And then when they're done with him, they'll wash our entire gods forsaken district in blood."

Shora had gone very still, eyes lowered. Her face twitched, flittering expression of rage and pain. Auntie closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths.

"I know..." Auntie sighed, "I know you didn't mean it. It's hard, and you think if only..." She shook her head slowly, as though remembering, "You think if only you get that one score, you can get out. But girl," her eyes softened and she lifted Shora's face by her chin, "it's _always_ a trap. And Reesh is trapped most of all. He a drug lord now, and he can't stop. If he does, he dies. He's in the game now, and there's only ever one exit."

Auntie leaned back against the counter, and sighed at the ceiling.

"They'll come for him. Probably not tonight. Maybe. Depends on how quickly he can gather support. But he's coming and I can't protect him. I can't protect you, girl, cause they know you with him." She gestured at Sal, who was trying to disappear into the chair.

Shora slumped in her chair while Auntie looked at her hair, then again at Sal, then back at Shora's hair.

She scowled at the hair. "You go sit over there and let your hair relax," she pointed to a chair next to Sal, then shifted her finger to Sal. "You, sit here."

Shora fled the chair, giving Sal a sympathetic look with more than a little relief in it. What had been her "closely cropped hair" was now dangling almost to her shoulders, and it still had further to go. Sal stood, glanced over a Shora who sat primly, refusing to look at him, then again at the chair. He glanced at a glob of cream still on the floor.

"Oh don't be a baby. I ain't puttin' that stuff in your hair. It'd just ruin it."

"Ruins _everything_," Shora mumbled.

Mollified, Sal walked over, scooted up on the chair, and stared at himself in the mirror.

"Oh!" he exclaimed, mildly horrified at what had become of his hair the past few months. Travel had not been kind. His head looked like a mop.

"Oh is right," Auntie said. She grabbed scissors, looked back at his hair, slowly put the scissors down, and chose a comb instead. "This'll hurt," she said, and began to rip the knots out of his hair.

Sal endured it without protest. Because Auntie was very much right, and he would endure whatever pain if it would set his hair right.

"Now," she said, pulling at his hair, "what's your story?"

Sal blinked. "I ah... I was abducted, and now I'm getting a haircut." He frowned, then mumbled, "apparently."

Auntie waited for three seconds, then guffawed. "Well, I know _that_."

Sal nodded, "It's been an odd day."

"I can see why you like him," she said, shooting Shora an amused look. "Don't say much and I just bet he listens to your endless prattling."

"I do not pra—"

"Ah ah!" Auntie raised her finger. "Not your turn." She looked back at Sal. "Now, let's try this again. Where you from?"

"Larstead."

"Uh huh, and where's that."

"Santonia."

She lifted a brow, "Really?"

"He's a village boy," Shora said from behind.

"Hmm, okay. Tell me about this village of yours."

"Well..." and Sal tried to explain Larstead. Auntie continued to pepper him with questions: who was he friends with, what did the people of Larstead do, etc. She had a way about her of drawing out his story, of asking questions like she was interested, following up when she didn't understand. Sal's short answers became longer, and soon she'd teased out most of his story. Oh, there were parts he skipped, darker deeds he would never speak of, and he was pretty sure she noticed. But she didn't pry, allowing him his secrets. She got enough, though. She knew about Larstead, Alderin, the godling, the immense destruction, Inquisitors, assassins, and even his training. It was the first time he'd ever spoken much of it out loud, and some of it sounded ridiculous even to him. Yet Auntie accepted it all.

When he was done, he looked up and in the mirror saw Shora staring at him, a horrified expression on her face.

Also, his hair looked... good. Auntie had done a great job. Sal smiled a little, feeling as though some unknown burden had been lifted. It was stupid, maybe, but telling his story had helped some, and having his hair cut helped a lot. Stupid yes, but he couldn't help but feel like some small part of a world gone crazy had suddenly righted itself.

"You're done," Auntie said quietly, then looked at Shora. "You. Girl. Sit."

Sal evacuated the chair and walked back, avoiding Shora's still-horrified gaze, which turned resigned when she sat down. Auntie worked on Shora's hair in silence. She pulled, tugged, and pressed until what had been a mess of curls became straight and silky.

And Sal had to admit. It looked good. It made Shora look different, older. Shora clearly didn't feel the same; she plucked at strands of in distaste until Auntie slapped her hand.

Finally, Auntie spoke. "This... is beyond me. Hells, even the blacks don't know." She shook her head, looked over at Sal, then sighed. "You gotta go back to the blacks."

Sal nodded. He'd come to the same conclusion, or perhaps he'd never left it.

"What!? Auntie no! He don't need to be a gray! You know what that—"

"Girl, he's _already_ a gray, or didn't you hear." She raised her hand, averting another objection. "And you— no, _we_ gotta go into hiding til this blows over. Maybe... maybe another district. No! Girl, I won't hear another word. We can't stay here. None of us can."

Shora stood suddenly, looking devastated. She opened and closed her mouth but couldn't find words. Her fists clenched repeatedly. She turned to Sal and gave him a pleading look.

And he realized, she _cared_. About him. She shouldn't, and surely Auntie would tell her first, but she did. In some way, it was who she was, unwilling to give up on the boy she'd thought to save, thought she could take in.

And he realized, he kinda cared too. He looked back and forth between them, both staring, waiting for him to speak.

He gave them a polite smile. "I... have an idea," he said.

He told them. Cause here was a truth Auntie had already figured out. He wasn't a gray, not really.

He was a black. Perhaps he'd always been.
