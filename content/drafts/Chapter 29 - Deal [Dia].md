# 29 | Deal [Dia]

"Where's Tait?"

Sora Blackwater bit each word off. Narrowed eyes landed on each one of Dia's team individually, a lingering glare as though she could break them with a look.

_It's working..._ Dia swallowed hard, trying to shrink into herself while waiting her turn.

Moore did the best of them. He simply returned a sleepy, disinterested gaze. Blackwater didn't waste long on him. Malek had almost as effective a technique, which was to simply not look at Blackwater at all. He shifted his gaze back and forth between Kalina and Dia. Kalina lasted about two seconds.

"Who?" Kalina squeaked out, then flinched as Blackwater scowled at her.

"He's dead," Dia blurted out before Blackwater could flay her best friend alive.

Blackwater shifted her gaze to Dia and, surprisingly, her expression immediately softened.

"Explain."

Dia blinked. _She was trying to figure out who leads us._

"It was a bot he... he saved us."

Blackwater cocked her head. "A bot? I _gave_ him a disruptor— wait, how far down did you go?"

"Eight floors."

"Eight? My," Blackwater breathed out, "ambitious aren't we?"

"It was just the length of rope."

Blackwater gave her a confused look, then shook her head. "Still, he had a disruptor."

"The bot was shielded."

"They _all_ are. That's why they have two charges."

"I...don't think he knew that."

"He—" Blackwater cut herself off and closed her eyes, lips pinched. She let out a slow breath through her nose. Her eyes snapped open into a half eye roll.

"Come," she huffed out, annoyed.

Blackwater turned and walked away. Dia scrambled to her feet, then struggled to shoulder both hers and Tait's pack, which she could have sworn had doubled in weight. Moore practically snatched Tait's pack from her before she could finish.

"Hey!"

Moore walked on without a reply as he slung Tait's pack over one shoulder without any apparent strain. Dia rushed to catch him.

"Give it back!"

He gave her an incredulous look. "You're being stubborn."

"No, it balances the weight."

Moore looked askance at Dia but eventually swung the pack over and held it up so she could thread her arms through. She grunted as he released the weight, but at least she wasn't hunched over anymore.

Blackwater led them down a meandering path through half-formed hovels, many of which were little more than four walls of broken stone piled high enough for basic privacy and little else. Hollow men and women sat inside and out with empty eyes, staring at nothing.

Once pushers or feeders, addicts all, now broken husks, souls scraped vacant from a lifetime of hash, then thrust aside to the edges of society as discarded refuse with nothing left to give and no way to feed the habit that got them there.

Dia's eyes trailed over their brown skin faded dull and saw them anew. Mothers and fathers forced by circumstance to feed a system that cared nothing for where they'd end up. And for a tiny piece of their life each day, they were given fading pleasure and the money to feed their children, if they even cared anymore.

Dia's hand snaked into Kalina's and squeezed.

She had never seen them before, hidden as they were in plain sight behind so many platitudes formed of common sense. These were the unavoidable detritus of society, a burden born lightly if only because they were so easily pushed to the side. Like the broken shards of stone that now formed unstable walls, vacant eyed addicts migrated to places like this, forming broken collectives and empty homes, like among like, only to become decorous to the environment, safely ignored.

Kalina's jaw was clinched, eyes straight ahead, as though the very sight of these people could break her. Dia could not understand how she hadn't seen it before.

They chose this life. No one forced them. It's not as though both the pleasures and the dangers of hash weren't well known. That heady sense of power was no illusion, and neither was the money paid for feeding the system with it.

They chose this life. No one forced them. That's what she'd been told. Dia had heard it her entire life. They always have a choice.

And they were right. Kalina's father chose this. He could have let Kalina starve and live without a home. Hells below, he could have sold his beautiful daughter for coin on the street— it was done more than any would prefer to admit. But no, it was his choice to become a feeder. No one's fault but his own.

Kalina's palm had become sweaty. Her eyes moist, lips pinched. Dia wanted to say something, anything to help, yet every word presented itself as paltry, an insult for the ongoing sacrifice of Kalina's father.

He'd left her alone, and that was his mercy. She would not be forced to bear the slow death of her father, forced to see him fade, forced to lose him slowly. He was gone in a moment, like death, leaving Kalina the deed to their small apartment along with a weekly envelope of diminishing cash.

_He's a coward for doing that to her._ Yet the words felt as hollow as the emptied eyes watching them.

She squeezed Kalina's hand again, trying to get her to look over, if only so she could mouth the words, "I'm sorry." Kalina didn't respond.

Dia opened her mouth to say those words aloud when the world compressed around her, then stretched itself out. Her legs already struggling, she stumbled as the ground shifted beneath her ever so slightly.

_Reality bunched up, then snapped out like a rug shaking loose dirt._

She gasped, almost falling over as the thought rang through her mind.

"Dia?"

More than the feeling of a world stretched, it was the invading thought that drove Dia to distraction. These things she knew, she knew to be true. She'd never found them false, not once. Yet the idea that someone had compressed space itself so much that it snapped out to create the wave she felt now, hundreds if not thousands of leagues away? It was a terrifying thought.

"Dia?"

Blackwater had stopped and turned from the commotion. She walked back to Dia, who's eyes were darting around as though looking for something.

"Girl? You okay?"

Dia blinked several times before focusing on her. "Did... you feel that?"

"Hmm... maybe." Blackwater's eyes narrowed as they took in Dia. Her expression shifted from concern to annoyance as her eyes trailed over Dia. She let out an exasperated sigh. "Would someone get those off her?"

Her thugs looked around in confusion. After a few seconds, Blackwater lost her temper.

"You!" she pointed at a large thug, "take that." She shifted her finger toward Tait's pack.

"...and you," she said throwing her finger at another large thug, "take _that_." She shifted her finger to Dia's pack. "Is that easy enough for you to understand?"

Dia distantly felt fingers began to pry at the packs strapped to the front and back of her, but she was so busy trying to calculate exactly how much graescence was required to create a such phenomena.

_That can't be right... it's just too much._

It was only when she felt her pack being pulled off her back that she snapped back to reality.

Dia spun and smacked the thug trying to take her pack.

"_Mine!_" she snarled.

"Woah!" The thug backed up a few steps, rubbing his cheek. His expression quickly turned from shock to anger. He took a single step before Blackwater threw up her hand.

"Let her," she said, shaking her head in exasperation. She turned on heel and walked away.

The thug glowered at Dia, but fell in line. Dia barely noticed as she was presently questioning either her conception of reality or her talent... and reality was loosing.

Blackwater led them four levels up to the uppermost floor for the borough they'd been in. Like delving complexes, boroughs usually mimicked the columns of carved out mountain the complexes composed, except instead of stairs they had low incline ramps crisscrossing from one floor up to the other.

Dia had long ago surmised these boroughs were living quarters for the families of those who worked in the columns. Perhaps also staging areas for supplies? There were a lot of theories for the obviously specific structure of the columns. No one truly knew and Dia's idle theories would change little.

From the top floor of the borough, Blackwater wove the group down a circuitous path of back alleys that edged around the floor's circumference, neatly bypassing all the shops and food stalls comprising a full third of the floor, then beyond the scattered residences, and finally to a few larger buildings nestled toward the back.

Blackwater's compound was a two-story box building comprised of shard stone bound with white mortar. Two unadorned stairs rose to a single unmarked plain wood door, faded from age but thick and sturdy. Nothing of note marked the building as different from the other half dozen plain looking structures. As they approached, most of the thugs began to peel off in small groups until only four remained.

Blackwater led them through entrance and into a small foyer, where a receptionist was quickly in process of straightening himself as Blackwater walked up to him.

"Where's Tane?"

The man blinked, then rifled through papers before answering.

"Should be working with the Soron group."

"I would speak with him."

The man nodded. "I'll send a runner."

She turned and walked into a cavernous warehouse where workers toiled away. Most ignored the group, intent on their task, but a few cast curious glances before dismissing them. About two dozen identical desks were arranged into a grid and adorned by a single shaded lamp, several tools, a notebook, and a worker bent over some piece of graetech.

_They're examining the graetech to determine it's worth._

Blackwater dove straight through, aiming for a door at the back. Dia slowed as both her eyes and mind kept catching on the graetech pieces.

_Simple pen, pressure fed ink, direct feed, no reservoir._ Their groups had delved quite a few of these.

_Shield generator, two pace diameter shaped field, tiny reservoir, one second feed time, and..._ she blinked. It was a ring. Brass, or gold probably, set with a singe small ruby. It was nothing ostentatious, yet nice enough a Royal could wear it and it would disappear as some ordinary trinket. There was no outward indication of graetech, whose leads were exposed only on the inside of the band. Although if one stared intently into the ruby, they'd probably see the reservoir beneath it.

She shook off her wonder at what something like that would cost and moved on. Or, she tried to at least.

_Six cascading reservoirs cross-feeding four shaper rods with dozens of leads feeding both the reservoirs and the rods._ She slowed to a stop as she stared at what she could only describe as a slender, if bulbous looking elderin... wand? A smooth handle led to three orbs, which then flowed into a tapering rounded point. Yet the simple exterior belied an incredible complexity. Dia immediately wanted to study it, not to discover what it did— she _knew_ that already— but the genius behind its construction.

"What?" An annoyed voice drew her from her thoughts.

Dia looked up at a long, pale face with deep-seated eyes radiating wrinkles and framed by a thick peppered eyebrows. The man's hair was pulled back into a tail, white streaks tastefully contrasting black hair. He had deep frustration etched on his face as though born to it. The notebook beside him was filled with crossed-out notes.

She glanced back down at the wand and picked it up.

"Hey," the man growled, "don't touch that!"

_He has no idea what this does._

"Are you deaf, girl? Put that down before you hurt someone."

"This won't hurt anyone," she said distractedly as she turned the wand over in her hand, "or, at least not without a lot of effort."

"Oh that's rich," the man sputtered. "Put. It. Down."

Dia ignored him and pointed the wand at his lamp. His eyes drew comically large as he suddenly realized her intent. He jumped back, causing his chair to fall over, and practically dove out of the way.

Dia fed only half the wand, causing a fascinating interaction between the reservoirs and leads, which then connected with two of the rods to create shaped ribbons of intertwining graescence spiraling toward the lamp, where they immediately wrapped around the stalk and tightened.

With some effort— graescence didn't nullify physics, and the lamp was heavy —she lifted the lamp, appearing to make it levitate off the desk. A small smile crept onto her lips.

_How beautiful, and utterly useless._

It was at this point she realized the entire warehouse had gone completely silent. She slowly put the lamp back in its place and cut off her flow to the wand before looked around. Most of the workers were glaring at her with various looks of shock and anger. Mostly anger. She flinched at the hostility. Moore and Malek both looked far too entertained, while Kalina was levelling such a look of exasperation that not-so-subtly suggested Dia had just done something really stupid.

The man snatched the wand from her hand.

"You are either insane or stupid," he hissed through his teeth. "Never, _never_ use graetech you don't understand."

"But I do understand it."

"Stupid it is, then—"

"Am I now?" Dia's eyes flashed, reflecting her anger. "And how long have you spent on that trinket."

The man somehow sneered while opening his mouth for a retort.

"Joshua," Blackwater cut him off with a raised hand. Her gaze remained on Dia. "We've had half a dozen analysts working on that for months."

Dia blinked, looked around at everyone staring at her, and then met Kalina's eyes. Kalina closed her eyes and slowly shook her head in disappointment.

Dia winced. _Uh oh... I fucked up._

"Well?" Blackwater insisted.

Dia sighed; her shoulders slumped. "It creates ribbons of intertwined graescence but with intentional gaps between them. They're kept in a careful... uh, kind of homeostasis? It collapses when it encounters resistance. This causes the ribbons to tighten around whatever it encounters."

"Dangerous," Joshua whispered. His eyebrows had crawled up his forehead.

"No, I mean, not unless you aimed it at someone's neck— oh. Wow."

"Yeah. Oh."

Joshua righted his chair, sat, and pressed his fingers into the bridge of his nose. After a moment he seemed to realize something and moved the wand to the opposite side of the desk, about as far away from Dia as he could get it.

"Joshua," Blackwater said, "take the day off."

He waved her off. "I'm fine. Just give me a second."

Blackwater pressed her lips, but assented. "Well then, I think we should give Joshua some time to recover from his heart attack."

He grunted out a laugh. "At least I don't have to stare at this stupid piece of wood anymore."

"Just verify it, run it through the paces, then we'll get it sold. You'll get your cut."

"Kind of you."

"Hmmm." She turned to Dia. "Let's walk."

Dia took two steps before she realized something. She turned back to Joshua.

"Six reservoirs, two per orb, four shaping rods with a regulator each, and over a dozen leads— ah, twenty-eight, to be precise. The reservoirs are only used to stabilize the flow."

Joshua did not turn around or acknowledge her, but his hand did drag the notebook over to write the information down, though somewhat reluctantly.

Blackwater led Dia to a door at the back of the warehouse. While the others followed behind, Blackwater made certain to keep Dia apace with her, going so far as to lightly place her hand Dia's elbow when she inevitably fell to distraction from the graetech around them.

Dia's mind kept offering up tantalizing glimpses of knowledge drawn from the dozens of pieces in the room. She wanted to study them all like a gnawing hunger in her soul.

_I could do everyone's job here within the hour,_ she slowed a little until Blackwater pressed her to keep up. She reconsidered, _No, never mind. Even I'm not that clueless. I'd just end up studying them instead._

The back room was much smaller with a single long table in the center and shelves lining the walls. All of it was empty. The four remaining thugs remained outside, leaving Blackwater alone with the four of them.

"Place your pack there." Blackwater gestured at the table. "I don't normally do this, but I think it best considering the situation."

Dia exchanged wary glances with the group. Dia opened her mouth, but Malek beat her.

"Ummm... this was our delve?" Malek said, though making it sound like a question wasn't the strong stance Dia had hoped to take.

"Was it now?" Blackwater sounded amused. "Do you truly believe there was any possibility such a delve without my help?"

"Well, I mean, technically it was Tait...who..." Malek trailed off as Blackwater's expression turned dangerous.

"No," Moore finished for him, "there was not."

Blackwater nodded thoughtfully, then rapped her forefinger on the table three times. "You've been delving in my territory for at least two months now. This isn't as uncommon as you might think, and I normally let the traps dissuade most. Injury and death is a surprisingly good deterrent."

Dia sighed as realization struck her. "And those who keep delving you—"

"Take into my employ, yes."

"And you're okay just letting people die like that?" Kalina's tone was offended.

Blackwater gave her a strange look. "I don't make people delve."

"But you could stop them."

"I doubt that. Strong guards make for strong temptation. I'd only convince people there was something valuable to guard."

"And why would she," Dia interjected with a hint of bitterness in her tone, "when it weeds out those ill-suited for delving."

_All this time and I've been applying to work for her whether I want to or not._

Blackwater gave Dia an approving smile. "Training is expensive. Tools are even more expensive. So yes, you get a choice. Delve for me and get the training and tools to survive, or don't delve at all." She paused, then wagged her head. "Or, I suppose you could move outside my territory. I hear they don't post guards in some boroughs. Their survival rate for delving is abysmal, though."

"So we _do_ get a choice?"

Before Blackwater could answer, the door opened to reveal a thick, barrel chested man with ruddy-brown skin, long dark hair, and a paunch that somehow suggested more might than laziness. Dia blinked twice at the sight of a wooden sword tucked into a light brown belt. It took her a moment to realize it wasn't graetech at all, but just a plain wooden sword.

The man met Blackwater's eyes, then leaned back against the shelving with a bored yet annoyed look on his face.

Blackwater pressed her lips together. "I normally wait until the delve after some injury or death to make my offer, to weed out those... ill-suited for delving," she said, mimicking Dia's words. She turned to the man who'd just entered. "Tane, how many delves do amateurs survive before injury or death?"

Tane grunted, "One." He paused a moment, then shrugged. "Maybe two, three at most."

"Mm hmm," Blackwater turned back to Dia, "and how many delves have you managed?"

"...fourteen."

Tane's eyebrows jumped up. He pushed off the shelves and began examining the group, looking confused.

"Fourteen. Do you have any conception of how rare that is?"

Dia shrugged. "It was just the upper floors."

"_Just_ the upper floors. Right. The same floors that have killed and maimed other delvers, you _just_ walk through. And also the same floors that have been scoured clean by dozens of delvers over the years. And yet," she rapped the table twice, "you somehow have managed to find tech."

"Not that much," Malek grumbled.

"Any is remarkable," Blackwater countered.

"But we do get a choice," Dia insisted.

"No," Blackwater shook her head slowly. "Fourteen delves, _and_ you've somehow uncovered tech that hundreds of delvers had missed? You made your choice a while ago, I'm afraid."

"But you just said—"

"And then there's the question of Tait."

"That wasn't our fault," Kalina squeaked out. "He told us he'd delved before. He clearly lied."

"Is that so?" Blackwater turned to Tane. "Did you not train Tait and take him on a delve?"

"I did not."

"And so you see why I have a hard time— wait," she shot Tane a startled look, "what?"

"We set a time; he didn't show."

"He didn't show..." Blackwater trailed of, eyes narrowed, "but you gave him a kit."

Tane frowned. "I don't hand out kits. That's Soma's job."

Blackwater worked her mouth for several seconds before spitting out, "of all the fools."

While Blackwater water adjusted to the sudden shift in the conversation, a predatory smile had crept up on Kalina's face.

"So let me get this straight," Kalina said, flashing Blackwater a venomous smile. "You sent us a boy who'd never delved once in his life to lead us eight floors down to our death?"

"Eight!?" Tane blurted out, incredulous.

"We've gotten off track," Blackwater said in an entirely too-reasonable tone. "Let's see the haul first."

"Nya ah," Kalina shook her head. "You don't get to cover this. We negotiate now."

_No._ A pit opened in Dia's stomach.

Blackwater closed her eyes and took a deep breath, releasing it through the nose.

"Haul first, then we negotiate. We can't come to terms without terms on the table, literally in this case."

Kalina glanced at Dia, but Dia's gaze remained firmly fixed on an empty spot on the table, her hands clenching and releasing repeatedly. Kalina pinched her lips, then nodded.

"Dump it," she said while unceremoniously dumping everything in her pack out onto the table.

Dia slung her pack around and placed it on the table, ignoring the relief in her back and shoulders even as her hands shakily untied the Inscriber from the pack. Once the Inscriber was free, she carefully turned her pack over and dumped everything out... or almost everything. A small sigh of relief escaped her nose as her tablet thingy remained in the fold she'd wedged it in.

She glanced up nervously at Blackwater, but the woman had fixated on the Inscriber with awe on her face.

"Is that...?"

"_Mine,_" Dia snarled and pulled it closer.

Blackwater blinked herself out of a daze and took in the rest of the contents on the table. The boys had likewise dumped their haul into small piles, though Malek had already placed his coveted hotplate to the side. He placed his hand lightly on it.

"Mine," he said with a greedy smile.

Blackwater stared at him like he was insane which, in Dia's estimation, was close enough to the truth.

"That is a problem," Blackwater said while pointing at the Inscriber.

"What!?" Dia immediately was on the defensive. "Do you even know what it is, how much it's worth?"

"What it's worth is precisely the problem. It's been over a hundred years since the last inscriber was found," Blackwater said, "and do you know what happened the last time one like this was found?"

Dia blinked, trying to recall her history.

"...no?"

"Several competing Royals decimated two entire boroughs to possess it." She paused. "Would you like to know who possesses it?"

The four of them looked at each other, but no one offered an answer.

"The Mai family."

Dia's eyes widened. "Oh..."

Kalina turned to her. "What?"

"They're the biggest tech manufacturer in Caldonia... probably the world."

"Can you guess why?" Blackwater shook her head, not waiting for an answer. "So no, I cannot sell that. The smartest thing to do would be to dump it in the deepest lake we can find. Forsaken gods, even if I did manage to safely divest the thing, do you have any idea of the chaos it would create?"

"You don't have to, it's _mine._" Dia glared at Blackwater.

"And what are you going to do with that thing, girl?"

"Use it!" Dia yelled, glaring first at Blackwater then shifting her glare to Kalina. "And I am not delving again, _ever._"

Kalina rounded on her. "What! Why?"

_You sure as hells know why._

"How can you even think about going back after what happened!?"

Malek raised his hand. "I can. I mean, for enough money—"

"Shut up!" the girls yelled at him.

Malek huffed, threw his hands up, and rolled his eyes. Then wisely shut his mouth.

Kalina spun back to Dia. "You are always like this!"

"Oh really, Kali? Tell me, what am I like?"

"Selfish. You only think about yourself and that damned... damned... thing." She pointed an accusatory finger at it. "And now you've got it you're gonna leave. Just... we don't matter, do we? You got what you needed and hells below, but it was always about Dia now wasn't it?"

"Oh come on, that is not fair, and you know it."

"_But you've already said it,_" Kalina screamed. "_You're leaving and that's it._"

Blackwater had taken two steps back despite the table between her and the screaming girls. She glanced over at Malek and Moore with a questioning look while the girls took a moment of silence to drill each other with their eyes.

"Just wait for it," Moore said, unconcerned but with sadness in his voice.

His words wiggled into Dia's brain, seeding doubt. Just the way he said it, Dia knew she was missing something. Kalina's anger— no, her _rage_ didn't make sense.

And then it struck her.

_She's trying to buy back her dad._

Anger drained from her face, pulling tears from her eyes.

"Oh Kalina!" Dia breathed out and took a step forward.

"No," Kalina shook her head vehemently, lips trembling, "no, no you don't get to—"

"I am so sorry." Dia took another step as Kalina backed up, looking like a cornered animal.

"I am not leaving you." Dia lunged at her friend to wrap her in a hug, but Kalina's face turned hard.

"Now is not the time," she hissed, shoving Dia back.

Heated embarrassment flushed through her as she became hyper aware of everyone watching her. What was left of her dignity warred against her concern for her best friend, then it all burned in a flash of anger.

_I have to make this right. I have to...fuck._ She sighed, _I'm not getting out of this am I?_

Dia turned to Blackwater and pointed at the Inscriber. "You don't want that."

Blackwater's face turned wary. "I wouldn't quite say that."

"Dump it in the deepest lake, I believe you said."

"An exaggeration, perhaps."

"But you can't actually do anything with it, can you?"

"Get to the point, girl."

"I take that off your hands," Dia said, trying to make it sound like she was doing Blackwater a favor, "you give me supplies, and I give you back graetech."

Blackwater blinked slowly. "Do you have any idea how much training something like that takes? The Mai family has people devote their entire lives to the thing."

Dia snorted. _I bet they do._

She took a deep breath. _Here we go._ "I'm different."

"Hmm, yes, let's talk about that. I presume you have some Trait— gift that allows you to sense graetech."

It was a decent guess and not unheard of, though like all Traits, it was rare. Something like that would be invaluable to a delver, able to spot traps in advance instead of having to lose one's arm for the knowledge. Something like that would make Dia utterly indispensable. She was pretty sure, though, that no one had even heard of what she could do.

"Not... quite."

Blackwater's face flashed irritation. Dia cut her off before she could speak.

"The shield generator on your left wrist takes three seconds to form a grade-two shield. The knife on your right hip has a flaw in the resonance that frays the edge it's supposed to make. The one strapped to your ankle is a little better, but it's much smaller. The caster on your left hip has a one-second delay. The _rail_ caster strapped to the small of your back— and what are you gonna do with that?" she shook her head, "Anyway, that one has no delay, of course, but it does have straight rails, and you're very roughly made spiraled bolt won't spin, bit it will lose a lot of momentum."

Blackwater's face had paled at Dia's description of every single piece of graetech on her person. Tane, on the other hand, was staring a Blackwater with awe...or maybe that was horror.

"Also," cause it was really annoying Dia, "that bolt is lopsided. It won't hit what you're aiming at. It almost _has_ to be on purpose. Nobody who makes graetech can be that bad, or they wouldn't be making graetech."

If Blackwater's face had paled before, it was now shaken and murderous. She reached behind and pulled out the rail caster out from under her clothes.

"A rail caster," Tane exclaimed, "really?"

"Shush, it was a gift...I think."

Blackwater unchambered a finger-length bolt that looked like a tiny drill bit and placed it on the table.

"Show me."

Dia picked it up and rolled it in her fingers until she found what she was looking for.

"See here," she pointed mid-way down the bolt. "See how it swells just slightly? It'll lock the bolt to one of the rails and push it off course as it leaves the barrel."

_Oh yeah, never mind. That's not shoddy work at all. Rather brilliant, actually, if one wanted to sabotage the caster._

"Of all the traitorous fucks," Blackwater mumbled to herself while snatching the bolt out of Dia's hand. She narrowed her eyes at Dia. "And you can see all that?"

"I don't see it. I just... know it."

"Know it?" Blackwater raised a skeptical brow.

"It's..." Dia sighed. She could hardly explain this to herself, much less someone else. "It's like knowing where the panel is to light your bedroom, and what it does."

"Okay, but that's because I use that panel every day. You've never seen this bolt before, I'm certain, and I have a hard time believing you know everything about a device before you've even seen it."

"Not everything." Dia shook head, frowning. "At least, not at once. But the longer I focus on it, the more I seem to know, like remembering something you forgot. When we first met, I only knew you had a rail caster. Later, I realized you had a spiraled bolt." She pointed at the bolt in Blackwater's fingers. "But it wasn't until I focused on it that I realized its flaws. And now, I could tell you exactly how it was made."

Blackwater blinked slowly at her, then waved her on. "Please."

Dia hesitated. "Do you know how inscribing works?"

"Let us say I don't."

Dia twisted her lips, trying to figure out how best to summarize one of the most complex fields of study in the world. Worse, most of what she knew was conjecture based on a very basic education and her intrinsic understanding of graetech.

That didn't mean she wasn't right, of course.

"Elderin reacts to graescence; it's why we use it. But it doesn't just react, it also... changes. Every time you feed a device graescence, the internal structure of it is altered. Barely altered. Hardly anything at all but over time, well-made graetech will get better, more efficient. Badly made graetech will get worse and eventually—"

"Okay," Blackwater threw up a hand, "let's say I don't need a remedial course."

"Remedial?" Tane protested. "I had no idea graetech did that."

Blackwater shot him a look of long-suffering. Dia spared a glance at her team, only to find them staring at her with strange looks on their faces, like they'd never seen her before.

_And this is why I never tell people._

"_Inscribing,_" Dia said loudly, drawing everyone's attention, "is the process of taking two or more resonant fields and using them to infuse a large amount of graescence into a very small amount of Elderin, causing it to rapidly change its structure. Inscribers like this," she lay her hand on the device, "are..." _a beautiful work of artisan art_, "...efficient enough to change individual grains within the wood, something most devices could never dream of."

"Dear," Kalina broke in rudely, "please stop fondling it. You're embarrassing us."

"Anyway," Dia snatched her hand back and shot her friend a nasty glare, "most Inscribers," _if you can even call them that,_ "can't do anything like that. They're too crude and inefficient, so they overcome it by shoving in large amounts energy. But when you do that, oscillations occur within the fields, and that creates repeated patterns of defects."

"I don't see how that tells you how this," Blackwater waved the bolt, "was made."

Dia blinked at her. "The defects are concentrated on that one area."

It was Moore who figure it out first. "They slowed down."

Dia shrugged. "I think it's more like they rushed the rest of it; it's not nearly as reactive as it should be."

Blackwater took a deep breath. Dia opened her mouth to continue— and oh could she continue —but Blackwater threw up a hand.

"Assuming you're not making all this up, I still don't see how it translates to you creating graetech."

"But I _know_ graetech; I _know_ how that works," Dia protested, gesturing at the Inscriber, "and I know how to use it."

"Perhaps, but it doesn't mean you _can_ use it to do anything other than ruin blanks."

Dia frowned, absently rubbing where the Inscriber had stabbed her.

"Still," Blackwater continued, "I don't want that thing anywhere near me. So here's the deal. You take that," she gestured at the Inscriber and Dia's face lit up. "I don't care where, and I don't want to know. Just get it away from here. If you want to actually use it, though, you'll need blanks, and unless your parents are far richer than I've guessed, you don't have the money for it, much less access."

Dia's face pinched. It was a big issue she hadn't quite solved yet. Elderin was tightly controlled by the Empire. Caldonia, being the Empire's primary source for manufacturing graetech, had much looser restrictions, so it was possible to gain blanks if you had the right contacts and a lot of money, neither of which was generally accessible to a seventeen-year-old girl.

Blackwater wasn't done, though. "There's a small-time broker over in the Kalora borough, top floor. Name's Jed, kind of creepy, but he's harmless, mostly. Sells to some of the smaller houses. He'll loan you— and by him, I mean me —ten blanks, _small_ blanks. You turn those blanks into real, functional graetech, then sell them back to him. Half of that will go toward the loan. The rest you can use to buy more blanks. In the meantime, you delve—"

"What? No!"

"—once a week. This is not a negotiation. If you can pay it off with the graetech you make, then fine, but until then you'll be paying it off with delves."

The relief on Kalina's face was palpable.

"I can't do once a week; there's just no way. I have school and I need time to actually use the Inscriber."

Blackwater tilted her head back, closed her eyes, and took a breath.

"You realize it'll take much longer to pay off your debts," she lowered her head, "and those debts will include your training and kits."

"Wait," Kalina broke in, "we don't need training or ki— err no. No we need kits. Definitely need kits."

"You don't think you need training!?" Tane sputtered.

"What happened to Tait again?" Blackwater backed Tane up.

"Woah," Malek said, "that wasn't our fault."

"Wasn't it, though?"

"He told us he'd delved before!"

"And yet you're the delving group. It was your responsibility to see him through no matter what he claimed."

That shut the group up because as much as it grated, Blackwater was right. They were the delvers, and no matter what Tait had claimed, they were supposed to be the ones experienced with delving. They were supposed to know how to handle these sorts of situations...

Yet they didn't. And for that, Tait died.

"Fine," Dia broke the silence, "we'll do the training."

"A full week."

"What!? No, I don't have the time for—"

"A. Full. Week," Blackwater thrust each word out, "no exceptions. I want you alive well enough to pay your debts."

"...fine." Although Dia had no idea how she'd manage to hide missing a full week of school. "But we delve once a month."

"Twice a month."

"No—"

"Girl, it will take you _years_ to pay off this debt. Don't expound on stupidity."

Dia looked to the group for support and found three glowers aimed at her for essentially halving their income. Dia scowled but could see she was outnumbered. Reluctantly, she nodded to Blackwater.

"That's not all," Blackwater looked at Moore and Malek with predatory eyes. "We have small apartments. They cost, but even on two delves a month you'll not struggle to afford it."

Both of the boy's eyes widened, and in them Dia saw a spark of hope.

"Finally," she turned to Kalina with a small smile. "We will find your father and get him out. And so long as _she_ delves," Blackwater gestured at Dia, "he'll never need to feed the system again."

Dia's head jerked toward Kalina, who was staring breathless with wide eyes, mouth ajar.

_Wait!_ Her head whipped back to Blackwater. _How did she know about...oh, oh I've been played. Hard._

Blackwater had trapped Dia more thoroughly than had she chained Dia to a chair. At that moment, Dia understood exactly why it was rumored you could never leave Blackwater.
