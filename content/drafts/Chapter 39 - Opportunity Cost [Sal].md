# 39 | Opportunity Cost [Sal]

Thirty-six and a half boards. That was the width of his room. Someone had to have cut several boards into a half-width to finish the floor, which was absurd. It would have taken half a moment to size each room to an exact board width during design, but whomever designed it had no consideration of board widths, and so some poor laborer had been tasked with cutting each board in half, lengthwise, wasting hours of effort... or well, maybe. Sal had no idea how long it took to cut a board in half lengthwise, but he didn't think it was nothing.

The length was probably the same as room's width, but board lengths didn't really translate well. Still, three and maybe a third board lengths. Not all the boards were sized the same length; or perhaps their staggered layout just made it seem that way. He resisted the temptation to measure them for the seventh time.

A light rap of knuckle on wood drew his eyes to the door, a polite knock, then the door opened a moment later. Was it polite if they came in anyway?

Djrek leaned his head in. It was cut off by the door frame and looked disembodied.

"Ah, good. You're up early," the head said. It always said that.

Sal had been up for an hour and forty-two minutes, most of which had been spent sitting on the end of his bed. The bed was made; his second set of cloths and his nightwear were neatly folded on a worn and scratched dresser. Aside from that, he had nothing else.

Djrek blinked and took in the room's state with a blank expression. The head disappeared.

Djrek would wait. He always did and had not once needed to wait more than several seconds. This time it was four.

Djrek stepped in front of Sal and led him down the hall, down twelve stairs, through two sets of doors, and out into the dining area of the inn. He walked past Ash, who was eating breakfast at a small table in the corner. He continued on past the lobby where the inn's proprietor, a reedy fellow with wide, thick glasses stood behind a well lacquered table. He gave the Inquisitor a respectful nod as they passed.

Beyond were the streets of Edensville.

Calling them streets was to stretch the term. Mud paths were more appropriate, or would be had it rained anytime in the past several weeks. It had not, and so the mud had hardened into a street-like approximation, bellied only by its cracked appearance and the obscene amount of dust that whirled in the slightest breeze.

Above, the sky was perfectly clear; it would have been a nice day if it hadn't been every day. But the clear sky beat an already merciless sun down at low angles on grass that had browned and withered. Even the trees were looking closer to autumn than the time of year warranted. Edensville was a mountain town set in the foothills; it should not look like it was edging in on the desert.

A constant stream of people flowed around the inquisitor and his apprentice despite the early morning. These would thin out over the next hour, leaving Edensville to languish in the sun, mostly empty until sometime in late afternoon, when a new flood of drajin-led caravans stopped to rest for the night.

The lifeblood of a transfer town, fed by the commerce of travel, pumped in by the massive beating hearts of cities too distant to consider.

Two blocks and they cut a right to follow a narrow alley that opened into a larger thoroughfare. It was dominated by two long lines of floating, drajin-pulled sleds that drained out of both sides of the congested town. It was loud and filled with the breath of beasts, the rattle and creak of wood, all undercut by the constant din of blended conversation and punctuated by the occasional yell or curse.

Djrek cut through the fare, in between the two lines and lizards with feet that could crush them if only the lazy beasts could be bothered. Instead, the nearest one snorted at them a twin of dust devils that dissipated in the breeze as they passed.

On the opposite side were lined a series of food vendors in movable carts. Dividers had been hacked together to cut down the dust, presumably to protect the food, though how effective was an ongoing question. Each one had a line, their denizens afforded the wait by the morning's congestion. It happened every morning, and the food vendors knew exactly how to milk the harried and impatient caravan drivers stuck in traffic.

Djrek walked up to the same vendor he always did. The line parted as he approached, affording him priority. Sal suspected he would just as happily wait in line, but no one wanted to be the one who delayed an inquisitor.

He handed two bills and received back two pastries filled with scrambled egg, spiced meat, and still-bubbling cheese wrapped in paper. He handed one to Sal and waved off the change offered by the vendor, same as he always did.

Sal ate as they walked, careful to keep the crumbs in the folded paper and the juice in a pastry that looked like a square flower with eight pedals folded over and baked.

Djrek led them down the thoroughfare two blocks, then a right down a street half the size, yet stuffed with sleds being readied for travel. The path cleared itself as he walked; sleds were suddenly adjusted, crates moved, people disappeared. Djrek never had to adjust his gate or alter his course as the sea of humanity parted for him.

Sal had finished his pastry by the time they arrived at a wiry man loitering about a door inset into a brick wall. The man paled impressively at the sight of the inquisitor and pressed his back against the wall. Djrek opened the door and walked in without a glance. Sal folded up his paper and handed the man the remains of his breakfast, who took it with a thoroughly confused look.

Inside was a sparsely lit warehouse filled with the motion of a synchronized dance. Crates, grouped up on the right side, were being carried out by pairs of men and loaded onto waiting sleds. When one pile emptied, it was almost immediately refilled. Deeper in were men filling the crates with all sorts of goods. Dust swirled in the air, giving emphasis to the morning's dance.

Almost immediately the cadence shifted into a higher beat. The crates and people rearranged themselves in an entirely different way than they had in the street. While they certainly made way for the inquisitor, the level of commotion went far beyond with a kind of panicked haste as crates were positioned to obscure or reveal. Sal had to restrain a snort at the futility of it all. Djrek had long since gathered the evidence he needed; this rearrangement of the furniture would change nothing of what was about to happen.

Men peeled off from their duties and followed the pair as they walked. There was no signal that Sal could determine, nothing yelled or nodded, no hand signals. A worker would simply spy the pair walking, stop whatever he was doing, and walk over to follow them at a distance.

Sal picked up his pace to draw close to Djrek. He didn't truly believe they were stupid enough to attack, but he wasn't about to give them the chance.

Djrek headed straight for the office in the back as though he owned the place. He'd never been here, but Ash had produced schematics for the entire building and all the others beside it. Standard operating procedure, they called it.

The men followed as Djrek came to the office door. Another one was there ready for him; he opened the door. Djrek walked in, followed by Sal and eleven seemingly random men from the warehouse. The one at the door entered last, bumping the count to twelve, and locked the door.

There were two empty chairs, old and made of shoddy wood, placed before a large polished desk, on which were a scattering of papers. Behind it sat a portly man with dark brown skin, black slicked hair, lip graced with a thick mustache. A cigar of hash half hung out of his mouth; a single stream of smoke rose from it. A gravtech lamp hung from the ceiling and lit the desk, the man behind it through a haze of smoke, and little else.

Sal spared a moment to take in the scene, sighed, then grabbed one of the empty chairs and dragged the chair toward the corner of the room while everyone watched. One of the men blocked him, so he stopped and stared at him until the man began to fidget. The brute lasted twelve seconds before he finally moved aside, allowing Sal to plant himself in a dark corner to watch.

The man behind the desk leaned back and pulled his cigar out with two fingers; his chair creaked dangerously. Djrek had maintained a pleasant expression the entire walk, but that now shifted to an amicable, if polite smile.

Sal winced. Djrek always maintained a pleasant attitude. Always. Most of the time it mimicked the same expression a professional might have doing the craft he loved. For the first two weeks, Sal was convinced it was just that: mimicry, a mask, something to paint over a darker truth. Yet he'd never seen the cracks such a mask should have revealed; Djrek was truly happy all the time.

It might have been comforting if it didn’t inspire utter terror.

It had taken Sal a full month to discern Djrek's smiles, and still he would consider himself barely competent. The polite smile, though, that one he knew, and it never ended well for the recipient.

"Mr. Gastrick, I presume?"

Gastrick grunted a wordless response. He spent eight seconds taking in Djrek before shifting his eyes to Sal.

"That the boy? The survivor... the _only_ survivor?"

Djrek nodded. "It is, in fact." His polite smile didn't waver.

"And you brought him here?"

"Well, he does need to learn, and nothing beats hands on experience."

"Sure. Whatever your reason," Gastrick waved his hand; a thin line of smoke trailed it, "I must thank you. This will solve several problems at once."

"And may I presume these gentlemen consist of all those individuals involved in your Elderin operation?"

Gastrick said nothing, but drew deeply from his cigar, then blew it out toward the Inquisitor. Several of the men shifted on their feet. Sal leaned back and put his hand on the edge of his seat near his pockets.

Gastrick jerked his head, and several men launched toward the inquisitor at once.

Djrek moved but that wasn't quite right— he didn't move so much as he simply appeared in front of one of the men, his knife already embedded in the man's eye. Sal had seen this several times but he still couldn't understand how Djrek did it. From there Djrek danced back and casually swiped the neck of another while ducking a second attack and avoiding the spurt of blood from his victim's neck. He continued the dance, flowing seamlessly between the attackers at a speed that made them appear clumsy and slow.

Sal would have liked to watch the whole thing, but a motion on his right drew his attention. The man who'd blocked him was turning toward him, knife in hand.

Sal stood and shifted toward the man. He brought his own knife up, allowing the man to turn into it and pierce his heart with his own momentum. He jerked and stopped, knife half poised while his expression shifted to confusion. He looked down and stared at the knife in disbelief, then looked back up at Sal. His eyes glazed over as he collapsed.

Sal stared at the man for three seconds. He shifted his gaze to the bloody knife. His own expression now almost mirroring the man's confusion before he died.

The room had grown silent except for heavy breathing, and it drew Sal from his fugue. He blinked twice, knelt down, and wiped the blood from the steel. Only when he stood did he look at Djrek, who stood relaxed in the center of a room full of the dead, his weapons sheathed, arms behind his back. His coat was unmarred and the smile he wore betrayed intense interest in Sal.

"I thought..." Sal looked back at the man on the ground. "I thought I would feel something."

Djrek nodded as though he'd expected this. "Not all do."

"But what does that make me?"

"Capable."

Sal frowned as Djrek turned back to Gastrick, the source of the heavy breathing. The man had pulled out a caster and had it aimed at the Inquisitor with a hand that shook so bad he likely would have missed anyway. Why he hadn't fired Sal didn't know, but— oh. Sal turned and found a bolt embedded in the wall behind him. Never mind. The man's caster was already empty.

"Mr. Gastrick, I have some questions for you, if you don't mind."

Djrek pulled the remaining chair over, placed it in front of the desk, sat down, leaned back, and crossed his legs. Gastrick remained standing, eyes wide, hand shaking with an empty caster still aimed at the inquisitor.

"Lacinda should be at the market by now, I'd think. Yes? I believe she's getting flowers for your daughter. She likes to braid them into her hair even though Riya will have them out within the hour." Djrek shook his head slowly, a contemplative smile on his lips. "Stubborn, that one. Much like her father, I think."

Gastrick's hand had slowly dropped; his face turned pale; his mustache twitched. Without looking, he dropped into his seat. He carefully placed the caster on the desk, making sure it pointed to the wall; it rattled from the man's shaking hand before he removed it.

"You, sir, are a astute businessman. You love a good deal almost as much as you love your family. Shrewd, smart, you allow nothing to come between you and a good deal. And, I daresay, there is nothing you wouldn't do to protect your family."

Djrek stared at the man for thirteen seconds before Gastrick suddenly realized the Inquisitor was waiting for a response. Calculation passed over the man's face as habit drove him to find any edge he could use. It passed barely a moment later and his face deflated. He jerked his head, eyes planted on the desk before him.

"Yes," Djrek nodded, "nothing you wouldn't do. And yet," he rapped his knuckles twice on the chair armrest, causing both Gastrick and Sal to twitch, "beneath that calculating veneer, you _care_."

Gastrick's eyes latched on to the Inquisitor, the edges crinkled in confusion.

"Nakash is... or, well, he was a good man. He sought only to work hard and provide for his family. Yet a mistake on the docks of your competitor, just one broken, plain-looking crate — just one little slip — and he found himself buried under a mountain of recompensive debt. He was going to run; they wanted to sell off his family to pay the debt, force him into all but slavery. But _you_! You bought. his. debt."

Djrek uncrossed his legs and leaned forward. "But that wasn't enough. You bought him a house, gave him a place, secured his future— I daresay there was never a man more loyal to you than he was."

"His family," Gastrick whispered as he stared at one of the dead men, whose blood continue to spread out onto the floor.

"Yes, his family— and we found a dozen more stories like his."

Djrek leaned back and crossed his legs, patiently waiting for the man to come back to himself. It took a full minute and thirty six seconds of silence before Gastrick blinked, another six seconds for him to collect himself, and two seconds to gather the courage to face the Inquisitor.

"What do you want?" Gastrick's voice cracked.

"I understand why you chose to smuggle the Elderin. Sure, it was risk, even a big one, but the payout. And what did you do with all that money? You, sir," Djrek shook his head in wonder, "you gave it back to the community. Yeah, sure, you upgraded your house— but you didn't go buy a new one. No, most of those dozen stories came _after_ your influx of cash."

Djrek took a deep breath in through his nose and let it out slowly. Gastrick looked at him like the inquisitor was death itself; he looked at him as though he were hope incarnate.

"Now, I'm not a fool," Djrek said. "I don't think you're some bleeding heart. No, I think you're _smart_. You spread all that money as an investment, giving to the community, to the people, and earning their loyalty, their love, their trust. It's brilliant. Utterly Brilliant."

"What do you want?" Gastrick repeated in a dead tone.

"I will give you the same deal I was always going to give you... you and your men. Tell me everything you know, leave nothing out, and I will forget this ever happened."

"All my men..." Gastrick squeezed his eyes shut, then shook his head. "They'll kill us all if I tell you anything. Not just me, not just my men. Everyone. Every. single. person. The whole town."

"No, my friend. They will not live long enough to do so."

And Gastrick, surrounded by twelve of his best men, all dead, believed him. He spoke tentatively at first, of deals and shady men offering hope. The damn soon broke, and spoke of shipping routes, and contacts, and names, suppositions, conjecture, theories. He spoke it all in a single monotonic monologue. Djrek listened with rapt attention, even as Sal began to doze beneath the tang of a strong copper smell that not even the smoke-filled room could obscure. Very little of it made sense, especially the long list of contacts the man rattled off. Sal's eyes drooped and he drifted as the Gastrick began talking about Royals. He didn't know who backed the operation, but he had theories, lots of theories—

"Youlson!" Sal jerked upright.

Gastrick cut off mid-sentence and stared at him while Djrek turned around.

"Youlson?"

"A minor Royal," Gastrick said. "I suspected him but he was pretty low on the list."

"He used to visit. Maybe once every four or five years."

"He was the one in town?" Djrek asked.

"No. Someone else, but I don't know who."

Djrek nodded, his face pleasant and thoughtful. He stood suddenly, causing Gastrick to jump up in response. Sal stood also, then frowned at the sticky wetness of the floor.

"Wait!"

Djrek raised his brow.

"I think... I think the town was some kind of experiment."

Djrek sat back down. "Explain."

"It's just this. Nobody left the town, ever. Nobody ever went there, nobody left. Nobody except one old man who led the sled."

"That is unusual, Mr. Gastrick, but easily explained by the need for secrecy given the illegal nature of the enterprise."

"No, I know. But this has been going on for decades. I'm not the first to smuggle Elderin from that town, you know."

"I do."

"Right, right. Of course you do. So you must have noticed how much they're paying for the Elderin."

Djrek leaned back in the chair. "Indeed."

"Elderin is absurdly expensive, but even if it was elder quality, they paid too much."

"They wanted to keep you happy."

"Yes, yes. And the town, Larstead, is rumoured to be... nice."

Djrek nodded toward Sal, who'd walked up to stand beside him. "I've heard. But again, this can be explained by the need to keep them happy."

"They were already paying too much. And Larstead may have produced excellent Elderin, but it wasn't a whole lot. There had to be another reason for it."

"And that would be...?"

Mr. Gastrick leaned forward. "You know what they say about the Royals?"

"Please enlighten me."

Doubt flickered across Mr. Gastrick's face, but he had nowhere to go but forward.

"The whole reason Royals are more powerful, with magic of course, is due to their proximity to the Elderin."

"Interesting rumour."

"Perhaps, perhaps. But consider. A town, remote, producing Elderin but not enough. What if they _wanted_ the town's people to be close to those trees?"

"Indeed, and so what?"

"Well, what indeed," the man mimicked Djrek's words but seemed unaware. "What if the whole point was to produce something..." Gastrick leaned forward so far that his seat began to tilt, "or someone _powerful_," he whispered.

There was a kind of desperation on Gastrick's face that made Sal cringe. As though his one pet theory could erase the magnitude of death his mistake had wrought. But he was met with nothing more or less than a polite smile. He might have been talking about the weather so far as Djrek's demeanor.

Djrek stood.

"I would like to thank you for you time, Mr. Gastrick. You've been exceedingly helpful. I'll have some people come collect the Elderin you currently have on end. In the meantime, I think you have some explanations to make and, in the future, I'm certain you will continue to make intelligent business decisions."

And with that, Djrek turned and walked out, Sal close behind, both trailing bloody footprints into the warehouse.

After they left, Gastrick licked his lips repeatedly, then fell back into his chair, dropped his head into his hands, and wept.
