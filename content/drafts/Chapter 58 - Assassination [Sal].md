# 58 | Assassination [Sal]

On the third morning, Sal stood outside of their hotel with Djrek, waiting for the staff to bring out their horses from an underground stable. He shivered lightly in morning's winter chill, looking up at twelve stories of marbled stone artifice with four thick columns bracing the building. He was certain they weren't actual columns, and yet they were impressive all the same.

Or, they would have been if the building wasn't just one of many. And perhaps if the Spires themselves weren't visible. No longer did the Spires dominate the horizon; they dominated the sky itself. There was no place they couldn't be seen, drawing the eye as though some giant threatened from above. Staring at them induced a vertigo that made it feel as though the world itself was moments from tipping over.

They had stayed on the twelfth floor facing the city. It had presented a view that turned a forest of two and three story buildings into little more than grass punctuated by copses of towers that grew taller and more ornate the closer they were to the spires. Far above was a second city, vast layers upon layers, suspended between the spires themselves, so far above that a thin layer of clouds drifted below it. Maybe. Sal wasn't sure they were actual clouds, since another layer was situated a fair distance above the upper city. And even that layer of clouds were pierced by the tips of the spires.

It had been the most impressive thing Sal had ever seen. Unreal even. Had someone shown him a painting of the cities, he'd probably written if off as pure fantasy.

They would reach the city proper today and then spend another two days travelling through it, in the shadow of the city above, aiming to reach the Black Spire beyond. Three more days of travelling, which was irritating. Djrek hadn't exactly lied— it _was_ three days to the city; he'd just happened to omit that it took another two days to get through the city.

Sal groaned as the hotel staff led their horses to them, already saddled and packed. Another three days on the hated beast, yet he swung himself up and onto the horse, ignoring offers of assistance from the staff. His inner thighs ached as they stretched.

And then they left, plodding through the most impressive city in the Empire... in endless monotony. It was all so impressive. Really, it was. The buildings were so much bigger and better than anything he'd ever imagined, and that was before taking into account the Spires.

They moved among a constant motion of people and animals, hurrying or loitering, and wearing endless styles both grand and mundane. But that had been true on the first day. On the third, it was all still impressive, but it was also the same. The same mix of people, the same dominating Spires, the same noise, the same smells. The plodding clack of horse shoe on stone set a rhythm that had driven him to sleep at least once yesterday— he had almost fallen off the horse. To be fair, he hadn't been sleeping well. He was tired, annoyed, and hated the beast he was forced to ride. He was tired of smelling shit on the air.

Within the hour they'd entered the 'grass', a term he coined himself when looking down on the endless three story buildings painting an endless brownish gray between copses of larger structures clumped together. Grass in a field. Individually unique, but at a distance? Distressingly uniform.

Walking through them? The same. Everything _was_ different. Even within long runs of clearly reused designs, people were still people, and so additions were made, paint added on occasion, signs, etc. Yet there was only so much that could be done when a single template created a hundred buildings, perhaps even thousands.

Occasionally Sal would start as someone got a little too close to what Sal had begun to think of as the "Black Bubble", or the space that naturally formed around the Inquisitors. But it was always someone too distracted to notice, and when they inevitably did, they would startle and jump away.

Yet aside from those rare moments, Sal mostly forgot that he was supposed to be bait for people who wanted to kill him. It wasn't as though the terror of assassins had diminished— it was certainly present when he thought to remember. It was just unsustainable. It was difficult to live in fear through the monotony of endless travel and aching thighs.

When it did happen, it occurred in no way that Sal could have predicted. It was eleven thirty-seven, and he'd been distracted by thoughts of food. He was bracketed by Djrek and Ash, as was their habit: Djrek on the left, Ash on the right. They plodded down the right side of the road. Sal had begun to drift again, lulled by the sway of the horse beneath him and the constant din of city noise.

A light whistle came first, but Sal only recognized it in retrospect. His first thought was to wonder why Djrek's arm was raised. His second was to notice the Inquisitor's grimace. Only then did he register that it had all been proceeded by a whistle, but the detail found no purchase to connect with the fear of assassination that Sal had once again forgotten about.

Djrek turned as Ash swung herself off her horse. Sal looked about confused, as a small worm of uncertainty grew in him. Djrek's arm was still in the air, which was odd. But he didn't look concerned; neither did Ash. Yet...

"Ash, careful," he said. He swung his arm around, exposing a small piece of spiralled wood embedded in his forearm.

Ash paused at the gesture, then nodded. Sal blinked slowly at a bolt, which had gone through Djrek's shield and at least two layers of clothes to embed itself in his forearm. Uncertainty shifted into dread. He'd seen that jacket turn steel without a severed thread. He'd never seen anything penetrate Djrek's shield— he hadn't thought it possible.

Ash walked around and scanned the buildings across from them. Djrek pulled the bolt from his arm, wincing. He examined it a moment, then put it in his pocket.

"You may want to dismount," he said to Sal as he swung himself off the horse.

It had been four seconds. That was it. Both Ash and Djrek looked calm, but months of travel with them had taught Sal to spot the tension in their bodies, like a coiled serpent ready to strike. It was only then that everything snapped into focus.

Someone was trying to assassinate him.

Again.

He tried to dismount but his stirrup came up with his foot. Panic surged a moment, but he pushed it down. Neither Inquisitor looked concerned. He'd be damned if he panicked now.

He reach over, _calmly_ reached over, and pulled the stirrup off.

"Got 'em ," Ash said, then disappeared.

Sal paused, leg half over his horse and looked for her. It took him three seconds to find her on a third story balcony. She flattened her back against the wall as Sal dropped to the ground, his eyes glued to her. She dipped her head into an open window for a moment, paused, then jumped through.

Five seconds later, a series of 'yippies' filled the air from all around them, followed a few screams from people one the ground. Sal watched in astonishment as people begin jumping _off_ the third story balconies around them. Astonishment shifted into horror as they approached the ground, then to shock as their downward momentum transferred forward, almost as though they were sliding through the air. Only then did he notice they were riding some kind of wooden board that glided through the air, and all of them were wearing masks, each painted into expressions of laughter.

As they converged on Sal and Djrek, several of them pulled out casters and began firing them. Djrek immediately shifted into a crouch and raised his arm, but the bolts simply bounced off his shield, _as they should_. The others simply yipped and yelled, weaving through the crowd.

Something hit Sal from behind, jerking him off balance. He yelled out as his bag was yanked from his shoulder. Djrek glanced at Sal, but he was pinned down. The bolts weren't penetrating his shield... yet. But one had, and he couldn't know if another would come. Besides, they weren't aiming at Sal, which was confusing, because Sal was pretty sure he was the target.

Two seconds later, as Djrek went to a knee, Sal began to realize something was wrong. Even pinned down, he would expect Djrek to be doing more. He would expect the attackers— which he was convinced were all youth —to be dying, and quickly at that. Yet Djrek seemed barely capable of standing.

No, he was swaying. Dread surged through Sal. Something was wrong, terribly wrong. Djrek squeezed his eyes shut, then stumbled to one hand. The other was still raised, shield still there... but now his arm wavered...

...and a bolt punched through. Only to bounce off his jacket.

Sal took a single step toward Djrek when the world went dark. He stumbled as he clawed at a rough fabric wrapped around his head, draw string tightened around his neck. Just as he began to pull at it, something slammed into him and lifted him into the air.

He screamed and tried to hit the thing holding him, but whoever had him was _big_. He tried kicking but couldn't find purchase, so he began hitting and thrashing as much as he could.

He heard cursing and felt himself sway through the air as though off balance. The... guy? who had him yelled out, though Sal couldn't make the words through the bag.

Encouraged, Sal thrashed even more until he felt something wrap around his feet, tying them together. He panicked when he felt his legs bind together— they were tying him up while flying through the air, which felt impossible. He fought as hard as he could when someone grabbed his arms, but after only a few moments they were tied up behind his back.

He tried to thrash more, but realized it was pointless. He couldn't affect anything bound up like this. So instead, he did what he should have done in the first place and began counting.

Seven seconds, then a right. Twenty-two seconds, then a left. From here it was a longer stretch, four minutes and thirty-two seconds, then a right. Occasionally, he'd feel a rhythmic dipping that made him think whoever held him was pushing off the ground. He almost screamed when they vaulted into the air suddenly, his stomach flipping inside out in the process. Then they began to fall.

He continued to count: left twenty seconds, left fourteen seconds, woah! up again, then right... left, right, left, right— wait, was this guy playing? Suddenly they went way up and crested, forcing Sal to swallow his stomach. Then they spiralled, around and around, down until it levelled off at what he was sure must be an incredible speed. And he had no idea of the direction.

He gave up. There was no way he could backtrack, especially when his only idea of their speed was somewhere in the vicinity of "we'll probably die if we hit something." And wasn't that a good point? He decided to be as still as possible.

The next two hours presented itself as long stretches of painful monotony punctuated by nausea inducing antics. The person holding him shifted holds several times, trying for each side, once up front, and once on top.

Top was best, cause it allowed Sal to actually relax, but he quickly realized it also made them top-heavy when they began to swerve erratically. It was the only time he thought they might crash, and as uncomfortable as the "side-hold" was, Sal did his best to make himself easy to carry. He wasn't fond of being kidnapped, but it was preferable to death by high speed collision.

When they finally reached their destination, Sal was unceremoniously dropped on the ground. He groaned and rolled, trying to unstitch sides that had seized up. He might be angry except he was pretty sure the guy carrying him also collapsed to the ground and was lying next to him, wheezing slightly.

It was ten minutes before he heard voices. Someone picked him up and sat him in a chair, though not roughly. They cut the rope around his hands, and pulled the bag off his head. He blinked, blurry eyed as he tried to take in the scene.

"So we taking kids now?" said a female voice.

"I'm not a kid," Sal replied automatically as he looked around.

They were in a warehouse, dimly lit by windows. Stacks of crates were scattered about, and on several of them sat his abductors, or three of them at least, with one more pacing the floor.

"For twenty mil? I'll kidnap a whole god's forsaken orphanage," said the guy pacing.

He was ebony skinned, thin, but muscled. Half his head was shaved, with the other half long and braided down one side. He wore a jacket that had been made into a vest by simply tearing off the sleeves. Literally. Sal saw thread dangling from it. Who does that?

"I dunno," said a thick guy sitting on a crate. He was pale white and heavily muscled, with the beginnings of what might someday be a deep read, thick beard. For now it was just red and somewhat splotchy. "We just took on the blacks."

Sal was pretty sure that was the guy who carried him the whole way. He looked exhausted.

The pacing guy, who was probably their leader, stopped and turn to red beard. "You was all hopped up an ready a few hours ago."

"That was before we took some kid from the blacks."

"I'm _not_ a kid."

They turned to him. The girl snorted.

"Uh huh," said the leader. "Where's Vex?"

"He'd better not lead em to us," said the girl.

Or maybe not exactly a girl. She was brown skinned and lanky, dark brown hair tied up, and almost looked underfed, but there was an edge to her that suggested she probably had a high metabolism or something. Also scars. A light, thin scar curved from her ear to just before her chin. She wore a light brown, sleeveless shirt that almost matched her skin. Several scars crossed her arm along with a bruise or two. She had a scowl that looked semi-permanent, someone that wouldn't hesitate to throw a punch. The fact that she had wraps around her hands supported the idea.

"He won't. He ain't stupid."

Her scowl deepened. "He's greedy is what he is. You saw the way he was eyein that caster. Greedy makes stupid."

"They'll get 'em if he holds on to it," said another girl, shaking her head, speaking for the first time.

She was darker than the leader, almost blending in to the shadows. She wore loose black clothing in a simple style. She was younger, perhaps, or just small, not that Sal was one to judge. Her hair was cropped short into very small tight curls, forming a small dark halo around her head. She stared at Sal intently.

"Even if they get 'em, and I say he ain't _that_ stupid. But say they do, it'll still take half a day for em to find us," the leader stomped down and flipped up his board, catching it in the air, "not unless they figure out how to ride one of these. An even if they do, we'll be long gone before then."

Sal frowned as he came to a weird realization. None of them were wearing shoes.

A door opened and everyone tensed up. A guy walked in, also brown skinned, short hair and wearing an actual vest that looked expensive, until you saw the hole in the side. Beneath it was a dirty white shirt. A cheap looking caster was belted to his side, looking as though it'd been repaired multiple times. Aside from that, he was ...unremarkable. A little paunch pushed his vest out but only a little. He carried one of the boards under an arm. He also wasn't wearing shoes.

The leader jerked his head up, "You loose em?"

"Yeah Reesh, I lost em. Had to drop the caster," Vex shook his head, looking disappointed.

"Yeah!", Reeshe's eyes widened in mockery, "_that_ was the plan."

"I know, I know. I just... it was just a _damn_ nice caster is all. Just the bolt was worth more than you are."

"So buy a new one. You know the score."

"I dunno Reesh," Vex said, wagging his head to the side, "I dunna think you can just buy one of those." He looked around, frowned. "Remmy not back?"

"Naw, he went to pick up the drop."

"Hmm," Vex turned to stare at Sal, "So we doing kids now?"

"I'm _not. a. kid._" It was really getting on Sal's nerves.

"Really," Reesh guffawed, "you ah, what? Ten?"

Sal's face flattened. "Fourteen."

"Naw, you shittin me? You're momma just didn't feed you, huh?"

"Not funny, Reesh," said the smaller girl.

Reesh turned to her, gesturing to Sal, "What?! He's smaller than you, Shora!"

"Don't be an ass."

"Fine! Fine. So," he turned to Sal, "you wanna tell us what you did? I mean, twenty mil... gods, what you do, fuck a Royal's daughter?"

"_Reesh!_" both Shora and the other girl yelled. The one looked like she wanted to punch him, but maybe that was just her face.

Reesh threw up his hand, "Hey, all I'm saying is he had to have done something epic. I mean, think about it. _Twenty mil_, just to pick him up. That's a dream score there, and you don't wanna know why?"

"You... don't know?" Sal asked.

Reesh stared at him. "No... you?"

"Uh, no. Not... really."

He frowned at Sal. "Someone's out to get you something fierce, and you don't know why? I mean, nothin? Seriously? That's kinda messed up, you know."

"I... something to do with my village."

"Your what now? Wait, where ya from?"

"I'm from Santonia... sort of."

Red beard whistled. "That's a ways."

"What do you mean, sort of?"

"He's a village boy," said Shora. She dropped from the crate and walked forward. "Ain't you? From the edges I bet."

Sal looked at her. "Edges?"

She nodded. "You look like a fish out of water. Like this is all new," she gestured around, then nodded again and shrugged. "A village boy."

"So what's a little village kid doing here? And why's someone paying us twenty mil for you?" asked Reesh.

"I'm not a—" Sal shook his head, teeth clenched.

"Something happened," Shora said, still staring at Sal intently, "you can see it in his eyes. Something big."

Sal was sure she was just guessing. Pretty sure. Still, she had that stare thing going and he started to fidget.

"Better question is what's he doing running with the blacks?" Vex interjected.

"See? What I say? Something big."

"Yeah, but how." Reesh peered at Sal. "Why'd you leave your village, little kid?"

"I'm _not_ a— aahh," Sal cut himself off at the humor in Reesh's eyes. The asshole was doing it on purpose. "It's gone, alright."

"Gone? You mean your village."

"Yeah."

"Just... gone."

"_Yeah_. Gone."

"Like... disappeared? Just couldn't find it one day, huh? Decided to take a walk?"

There were several snorts of amusement. Sal's face darkened.

"What? No! A godling destroyed it, okay?"

"Ha! A godling, you say huh?"

"Would explain the blacks," Vex added.

"Yeah, but come on now."

"No," the girl with angles slid off the crate, her board under arm, "you hear stories about em. Right? Take out a building or something, and the blacks come get'ya."

Reesh rolled his eyes. "Yeah, I guess, but they're just stories."

"Auntie knew one," Vex said.

"Ha! Auntie knew someone who knew someone who told a story is what she knew." Reesh turned to Sal. "So how big was your village huh? Can't been more than a few mud shacks, right?"

"Sixty-two buildings."

Reesh guffawed. "Sixty... two, huh? Just that?"

"More like a small town," Vex mumbled.

"Uh huh. Of mud maybe."

Sal's eyes flashed. He made to stand, but stopped when his bound legs almost caused him to fall over. Sal carefully lowered himself.

"It was not— what is your problem?"

"All I'm sayin is who cares if some guy knocked over a few shacks, right?"

"Or a girl," Shora looked annoyed.

"Yeah yeah, guy girl, who cares? It was probably an earthquake or something."

"It was not an earthquake," Sal rolled his eyes. "We don't get earthquakes in the mountains. And we don't build shacks. We build... houses. Homes. Made out of wood and stone. Even if it were an earthquake, they wouldn't knock them down."

"Volcano?"

Sal's face just flattened.

"What? They have those..." he scratched his head, "I think."

"I believe him," Vex said, "explains the blacks."

"No, not really. Blacks kill godlings, right? So the kid's clearly not one," Reesh gestured at Sal, "or, you know, he'd be dead. So why the blacks?"

"So that... I can become one?"

Everyone stared at Sal for eight full, very awkward seconds.

"Fuck me," Reesh said finally, "you gonna be a gray? We mighta just done you a favor."

Everyone nodded, but the way they looked at him made Sal uneasy.

"I don't understand."

Shora gave him a pitying look. She shook her head slowly. "Grays don't live long."

Vex nodded. "Knew a couple kids went that route. Inquisitors will take anyone who wants to try but they never... last."

"Fuck, don't sugar it. They _die_. Like right quick." Reesh jumped back up on a crate and braced his elbows on his knees. "I'll tell you what, kid. However this shakes out, you see a black, and you just turn around and walk the other way. Go find another village or something. Frozen hells, find _us_ and we'll put you up. But kid, whatever you do, don't become a gray. Not if you like livin anyways."

Sal stared at him for three seconds, opened his mouth, then shut it. Djrek had been training him for months, which probably meant he was _already_ a... gray.

Everyone turned as a door slammed opened, followed by the sounds of grunting and cursing. A young man came in dragging a large canvas bag that looked heavy.

Sal's jaw dropped. "Roland?" he whispered.

No. No, it wasn't. His hair was more wavy than curly. He had the same build, but didn't carry himself quite the same. A little leaner than Roland. The jaw wasn't as defined and... no, it wasn't Roland.

But for a moment, Sal's heart had stopped.

"Fuck Remmy, 'bout time."

"You're not going to like this," Remmy said, dropping the bag.

Reesh looked at him, then the bag. "That our drop?"

"Yeah."

"That don't look like our drop."

"Yeah."

"Remmy. Why don't that look like our drop."

"Look. It's what they dropped, alright? All I did was pick it up."

Reesh stared a Remmy for twelve seconds, walked over and slowly opened the bag. He stared into the bag for twenty-seven seconds while the air seemed to thicken with enough tension that Sal was certain it someone would snap.

"Reesh!" the scowling girl snapped out, "the fuck?"

Reesh looked up. His jaw clenched, lip curled in disgust, but when he spoke he just sounded... tired. "Hash. Bricks of it."

At his words, they all reacted. Vex closed his eyes and shook his head. Shora deflated, looking betrayed. The girl with hard angles turned punched a hole through one of the crates. Sal stared at it with wide eyes. He'd break his hand if he tried that.

Reesh walked over to her and put a hand on her shoulder. "Jin—"

"Don't," she snarled, snatching her shoulder away.

"I... we'll figure this out, Jin. We can—"

"What? Sell it? That what you wanna do Reesh, sell this shit? Make a bunch money off this shit? You fancy being a drug lord, Reesh? Huh?"

She'd gotten right up in his face and Djrek was backing up, looking very nervous.

"No! Fuck that. No, okay. We'll burn it, alright?"

Vex looked up. "Uh..."

"Or not burn it. I ain't stupid. I'm just sain, we'll get rid of it."

"Fucking ass—" Jin punched _another_ hole in the crate. "Fuck this shit. I'm going home."

They all watched her stomp out and literally kick the door open, which resulted in a startled yelp followed by shouting.

Remmy looked around, shrugged, and began walking back out without a word.

"Hey Remmy, hold up!" Vex shouted as he jogged to catch up. "You gonna get some eats?"

"Yeah, skipped lunch for this shit."

"How about..." Sal lost the words as they left.

Reesh watched them leave, then turned to Sal and stared at him for eleven seconds.

"Sorry 'bout this," he sighed, and pulled out a very familiar looking knife.
