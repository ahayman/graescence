# 27 | Wayward Homebound [Oliver]

Oliver woke up shivering. The sand and stone had reached deep into his bones to sap out the last of his warmth. Only the dredges remained, and he could feel the pull of temptation to let the cave have even that. At least then, he could finally rest.

Exhaustion came in waves that danced along his shivers, only to leave him bereft of anima.

He tilted his head until the top of a blurry purple angled into view. His marble, still out of reach.

Indecision lasted only a moment before the marble pulled him up, tearing him from the floor's cold embrace. The world twisted and blurred, its wobbling almost forcing him back to the floor. He caught himself on a locked arm, jarring his body and sending a spike of pain through the fog in his head.

It was enough to clear the fog in his mind, but even then it took minutes for the world to stabilize enough for him to crawl. The damn thing was barely more than a few paces, and yet twice he fell over before he reached it.

Tension flooded out of his muscles the moment he touched it. Warmth spread through his limbs like a heavy blanket and swept up through his spine, dispersing the fog in his head with a warm breeze.

He stared at the marble curiously, noting a sheen of diaphanous color woven through it. His graescence, he realized. He was feeding it, and it...kept him warm?

Weird? That was weird, he was sure. He'd never heard of graescence keeping a person warm, unless you fed a heater with it, of course.

He pushed more of his life energy into the ball, watching as the threads of colors thickened into deeper saturations. The world began to bulge around him as space twisted.

He let it go, and the world snapped back into shape.

But that trickle remained, feeding the sphere a constant thread of energy.

Concerned, he tried to cut off the flow. Nothing happened. It was as if a hole had opened up in him, slowly bleeding out into the marble. Unsure of what to think, he slowly set the marble down and began to back away.

He paused. A thin rope of color funneled from his hand to the marble. He raised his hand to inspect it, but the rope slid down to his elbow. Confusing, until he realized it was simply attached from the closest part of him to the marble.

That led to a second realization, that the rope didn't just extend from him, but _through_ him. All of him. Miniscule threads of color wound their way through his skin and, presumably, his entire body, though it was hard to check himself. They flowed, and as he examined the rope closely, he realized he wasn't feeding the marble so much as flowing his graescence _through_ it. The threads flowed in both directions, creating a tight weave he could barely perceive.

What that meant? He had no idea.

Carefully, he continued to back away, watching as the rope of energy grew taut and thin until after a few paces it snapped and dissolved.

Oliver gasped as a wave of cold and exhaustion drove him to the ground. His muscle began to shiver and insects birthed beneath his skin once again.

He scrambled back to the marble and snatched it up. Warmth spread through him, driving away the shivers and itches.

"Well...shit." He would need to keep very close track of the marble. _Very_ close track.

Also, was he addicted to a marble, now? That seemed a very odd addiction to have, but...well, it was keeping him alive, so perhaps he should be grateful.

But really, what he needed was to go home. That loneliness from before had never gone away.

He stood, then almost fell over as vertigo overtook him.

Right, he still hadn't eaten in...a long time.

His vision cleared after a few seconds. He was back in his original cave, having—and he was still having trouble wrapping his mind around this—_walked through a finger-sized crack in the wall._

Though Oliver's head had cleared, it left him exposed to cold, angry questions he didn't want answers to.

When _was_ the last time he'd eaten? What kind of damage had the waters done to his body? His mind? How long had he languished in this cave? How did he get out?

How much longer until he couldn't get out?

How long until he died?

Questions swirled around his mind like angry bees, refusing to be ignored. But they were uncomfortable questions, and Oliver had long since developed the habit of ignoring things he didn't like.

So he chose not to think about it, a perfectly rational response in his opinion. Instead, he played with his marble.

Oliver fed it, pushing his graescence into the small purple sphere while he watched. Sheets of overlapping color spread from the sphere, seeming to grab space itself and bend it around him. A layer would reach out and anchor itself just below the prior. The next layer would do the same thing and then pull against the outer layer while they both turned in opposite directions, twisting space so that it both folded and compressed the space between them. A new layer of color would then anchor more space just within the sphere formed by the other two. It then twisted in the opposite direction as the prior layer, giving Oliver the impression that the marble was folding space in the same way someone might...fold clothes.

A bad analogy, but it was beautiful in its way. And disturbing. Oliver was fairly certain space wasn't designed to do what the marble inflicted upon it. And yet there were worse ways to spend one's last moments than to succumb while watching the interplay of color.

It was also disconcerting, to say the least. The folds created a lensing effect that increased slightly with each new layer added, causing the world to bulge around him. If just the visual distortion might bring a person to vertigo, then the twisting of graescent energy would cause most people to empty their stomachs. Oliver, though, stood completely unaffected. His mind had confused his graescent senses with this newly colored not-vision, saving him from "feeling" the twisting energies around him like a wasted drunk in a parade.

After hundreds of layers were folded in on themselves—and that within barely a second—Oliver came to a new realization: he was shrinking. Or, at least, the space he stood in was. The world around him became bigger through the distortions, while the sands at his feet became small rocks.

Oliver took a step and realized it would take him ages to make it across the cavern.

No no no, this was stupid. Being small was...good? Certainly, it could be used for something, he was sure. What? He didn't know. But something. It just wasn't what he'd done. His walk through the crack in the wall took a few minutes, not hours. He was missing something.

Half-formed memories once buried beneath a haze of bliss-fueled apathy tried to spark deja vu, but the details were too blurred. He couldn't tease out what he'd done, just that he'd done it.

Oliver wasted a few minutes trying to manipulate his flows of graescence manually, but that twisted the world around him in ways that _did_ send his stomach reeling.

A memory pulled at him, one with a little more form than the others. He'd walked and the world leapt to greet him. Or lurched, more like it. The memory was laced with punctuated frustration as he'd kept moving too far or too little. Maybe. The memory skipped around, jumped forward, and even tried to run backward at times, all mixing up causality in a way that thwarted logical analysis.

But perhaps logic wasn't the answer. He'd certainly not be very logical during however many days—weeks, months?—of the drug-fueled diaspora of his thoughts that'd been his life recently. What he _had_ done was experiment endlessly, and surely so much work hadn't been burned away. He had to have learned _something_, even if he couldn't remember the lesson.

A few moments of twisted lips and furrowed brows, and Oliver concluded he might be overthinking it all, which held its own irony. He was not known for overthinking...well, anything.

So instead, he tried something that seemed rather idiotic. He tried to _will_ the world to move.

He almost dropped the marble when it did.

A tingling crawled through his body, worming through muscle and skin in a way reminiscent of the itch bugs, but in a pleasant way. This was the scratch to that itch, enough that he almost didn't mind the bugs burrowing beneath his skin if this gratification was its result.

The tingles ran through his arm until they burst from his skin and wrapped through the marble in a startling display of not-color.

In that incredible display of complexity, Oliver saw his mistake. There was no analyzing his way into creating this. He could barely follow it. On a whim, he tried to manually alter one of the many threads of light, and immediately the world bulged into an unpleasant bubble as the tenuous balance within the flow was disrupted and pulled off balance.

He could barely understand what he was doing, but he _was_ doing it...rather like walking. One didn't think about the thousands of little adjustments and movements necessary to placing one foot in front of the other. The body knew what to do, and thinking overly about the subject would only ruin the effort.

So Oliver pulled, and through the marble, the world responded. Far became near, and a single step brought him clear across the cavern and smacked his nose hard against the wall.

The world snapped to normal as he stumbled back.

"Oww..."

He rubbed his nose a moment, then stilled as something new entered his thoughts. He closed his eyes against it, but it wouldn't stop. Like a virus, the idea took hold, transforming everything until his eyes couldn't hold back the flood of tears.

"Oh..."

He collapsed to his knees. His breath came hard, and from his nose dripped milky water.

It was...hope.

Suddenly, he did not want to die. Which was confusing. He couldn't figure out when he'd given up and accepted that he would water this cave with his body, no matter how satiated it already was.

He'd never allowed himself to even consider the thought he was truly trapped here. Never allowed the idea to even surface. And so it had germinated beneath the haze, eating away at his choices until he'd been left with nothing but a hedonistic nihilism to fill whatever time he had left.

But now? Home.

He wanted to go _home_.

And that wasn't a concept he'd ever considered before. He never had a home. Just places to sleep, some better than others. Yet for what felt like the first time in his life, home had a meaning. More, home was a _craving_, a need, something even more potent than the bliss he'd been consuming.

Oliver latched his gaze across the alcove, on the chiseled hole he'd spilled out of what felt like ages ago. Colors spilled from his hand, and he stepped onto the ledge of that hole, its sides rising as jagged cliffs.

The view beyond was dark and myopic, with black darkness bracketing a barely lit pile of debris ascending into a mountain's peak. From where he stood, it would take months of climbing to reach it, if he even could.

Another thought, another burst of color, and he was standing on the top of that mountain, staring up into the endless black of a hole he'd once fallen through so long ago.

He couldn't see beyond a few dozen paces above him, but he didn't need to. He could feel the weight of the stone around him, guiding his efforts, allowing him to pull down that great height until it was little more than a single step.

With that step, he found himself in a vaguely familiar tunnel, too tight for most yet oddly spacious for him as he felt around it. He considered it for a moment, watching dark consume dark, with only the overlay of color to give any sense of direction. He flexed his will, and from it the black beyond condensed. He took a step and consumed the tunnel he once crawled through, bringing him to freedom.

Three steps. That's all it took. Sure, those three steps were drug-fueled magic impossibilities, but still, _three steps._ His mind kept wanting to reject it but for the blinding pain that stabbed into his eyes.

Light. Way, waaay too much light. Even with his eyes squeezed shut, it burned. Oliver stumbled into the wall, propping himself up with one hand while the other clenched over his eyes.

That helped. After a few moments, he cracked his fingers, allowing his eyes to adjust to the flood of light. Then he cracked his eyes until they watered. After a few minutes of adjusting, he was able to open his eyes enough to take in his surroundings and found himself...

...in the dead of night. Stars had been smeared across the sky like a child's attempt at finger painting, though his eyes might just be blurry. However, prominently placed high in the sky was the blue-green burning marble of Rotaka, fully lit up in blurry glory.

Maybe, just _maybe_ he'd been down in that cave a little too long.

He burned his corneas for far too long. Home called. He glanced briefly toward the sands, noting how close and peaceful they were. The violence of death had never looked so placid, but then he'd never tried to gaze upon it from so close. He decided that now wasn't the time. He'd already experienced its vengeance from too close and had no intention of repeating the exercise.

He pulled on reality and stepped into the next intersection away from the sands, trying to remember where he'd run from. It felt like ages ago, and the memories surfaced in untrustworthy ways.

After a moment, he chose right. It felt correct, if only barely. He pulled until he was at an intersection that looked remarkably like the one he'd left. The sands were still visible beyond the slight curve, a constant reminder that death stalked far too close for anyone's comfort.

A part of him wished he could stalk out there, into the sands, defying death itself and rebuffing its attempt to wipe humanity from the face of Ionia. But this was just a passing thought. No one ventured out there and lived. No one. At least, that was what the rumors said. Having experienced the sand's wrath, he was inclined to agree.

The rest of the night was spent in a blur. Intersection upon intersection appeared before him. At times he tried to pull from memory in an attempt to retrace his steps, but those failed him. He didn't know. So instead he chose randomly, attempting to at least move in the same direction he was certain he'd come from if only the walls of stone would get out of his way.

Labyrinth indeed.

Dawn had broken the sky by the time he'd found civilization, if you could call it that. A single girl carrying a sealed water jug had frozen at the sight of him. Her slacked-jawed, frozen posture spoke volumes of his condition, a thought whose implications he didn't want to entertain. So he pulled on reality, displacing himself in a single step and disappearing from the girl's view.

Civilization came soon after. He recognized none of it but proceeded nonetheless. The people scurrying about hinted of safety, much better than the ever-burning sands he'd been desperate to escape.

An endless litany of moments passed, intersections and people blending into a familiar cadence of escape. People noticed him rarely, and then only with a gasp before he disappeared again, compressing vast distances into a single step.

In retrospect, that may have been a mistake. May have, perhaps. Memory was a weird thing, and it often wove important moments into the mundane and boring, using them as a kind of connective tissue to make sense of scattered importance.

In other words, _walking_ between landmarks provided a continuity that simply didn't exist when landmarks suddenly appeared, seemingly at random.

Too often, Oliver found himself at a familiar landmark approached from the wrong direction, causing him to ricochet into an unfamiliar area. Backtracking worked...occasionally.

One critical moment came when he arrived at a row of food stalls sequestered beneath a large overhand of rock, conveniently protecting them from the scorching sun. Oliver's stomach twisted and writhed in pain, awaking from it's long slumber by the aromas of cooked scorpion, fried mushrooms, and a host of other delectables.

It took every ounce of will he had to forego suicide by stomach, a thing that would certainly happen if he tasted a single bite of the divine sustenance lined up before him. Just one bite, and he was certain he wouldn't stop until his stomach exploded.

Besides, he might be a thief, but he did have principles. He stole from bosses, from the rich, and from those who deserved it. He did _not_ steal from hard-working food vendors barely squeezing their rocs from stone.

And so with as much will as he'd ever exercised in his life, he compressed and twisted space and stepped out of that area...only to become lost again.

In all that motion, he hardly took far fewer steps than if he'd tried to walk between any two of the landmarks. And that was a good thing. While he could literally compress space all day, that much walking would likely have spelled his end. He simply didn't have the energy for it. Instead, he spent most of the day staring confused at whatever intersection of the labyrinth he'd found himself in, wondering if he'd been there before.

The critical moment came as the sun grew tired. Before him yawned an entrance that could swallow six abreast. Above, symbols had been chiseled into the stone for alcoves long since lost to the whims of time. All those who commanded the warrens below bore no resemblance to the petty egos that had once forced their names into stone. Several had been scratched out and replaced with less elegant markings.

The space for boasting had long been taken up by gang bosses who no longer mattered. And neither did Oliver. He only cared that his way had been cleared by idiots no more enamored by the everlasting life of carved stone than he was.

Home.

It called to him.

Familiar tunnels blurred as space compressed beneath his feet. Paths that'd taken him hours to traverse bent into seconds beneath his will. In moments he stood before a rough mycelium door, hanging ajar on one hinge, the other torn from the faux wood.

A deep foreboding decayed his hope as he dragged open the door into the hall with a rasp. Beyond was home.

And it was covered in blood.
