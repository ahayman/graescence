## This web novel has not started yet!

Yes, there are a couple of chapters posted, but they exist entirely so I can test the website's features. They
might be the chapters I start the web novel with. Maybe. I'm not sure. I've changed my starting point
for this series several times now. But they have not been edited. They're raw, and not safe for human
consumption yet. Proceed at your own risk.

Graescence is an epic-sized story following several protagonists as they navigate an ancient Empire spanning two worlds where technology is powered by magic, and magic is fueled by the living.

- **Dia** understands tech in a way no other can. While her only desire is to lose herself in the act of invention, others are not so willing to leave alone a girl who can develop tech powerful enough to change the face of the Empire.
- **Roland** is a boy who dreams of heroes and adventure. When circumstances reveal a power within him to rival the gods, he must choose what kind of hero he wants to be while others seek to fashion him into a weapon of war.
- **Sal** is an outcast born to a drunk, abusive father hiding from his past in the most remote village he could find. Shunned by everyone, Sal finds refuge in order and the one friend who accepts him as he is. Yet what little he has is stripped away when a godling destroys the village along with everything he ever loved, leaving him the sole survivor. Burning with hate, Sal takes refuge in the one order sworn to destroy all godlings, the Inquisitors.
- **Anastasia Longsun**, the spitfire princess. Born as the second child to the King of the most powerful province in the Empire, Anastasia has everything anyone could ever want...except freedom. Known for her fiery temper coupled with a fierce prowess in battle, few would dare cross her. Yet some things are beyond even her, and when politics conspire to force her into marriage, she's driven to do the one thing she never thought she would ever do: she runs.
- **Terra Va Belcia** has only two concerns in life: furthering her family legacy as one of the most powerful families in the Empire, and keeping her idiot older brother alive. Her brother proves to be the greater challenge, though, and after a series of 'mishaps', they're forced to disappear on a martial retreat while her mother repairs the damage. When their tour goes wrong, leaving them stranded in the most dangerous region of the world, she's forced to confront the truth that her brother may not be who she thought he was and, perhaps, neither is she.
- **Stanley Chao** was enthralled at the incredibly young age of three by a traveling troupe that sang, danced, and swung their way into his heart. Ever since he dreamt of bringing beauty into the world. His family harbored a secret, though, and that secret was him. Yet hiding him had always been a mistake and, once exposed, he was forced into a life of running for the crime of being who he was. Yet despite this, he never gave up on his dream.
